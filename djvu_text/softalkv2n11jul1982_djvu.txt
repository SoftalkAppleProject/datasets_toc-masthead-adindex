Picture this. Presentation-quality bar charts, line 
graphs, and pie charts. In black and white or color. On hard 
copy or a CRT. In seconds. 

That's PFS: GRAPH. The fastest, easiest, most econom- 
ical computer graphics software package you can buy. 

For the first time evei^ computer graphics 
without computer programming. 

With GRAPH, all you do is enter your information and 
specify the kind of chart or graph you want. GRAPH does 
the rest. So instead of making a lot of complicated calcula^ 
tions, you can make graphics. 

GRAPH is so straightforward, you can begin 
creating graphs and charts almost immediately. 
But it also has powerful capability you can stay 
with for years to come. 

For example, you can mix and match line and 
bar graphs, stack or compare up to four bar graphs 
simultaneously, even display as many as four 
graphs on the same set of axes. 

Software that pays for the system. 

Compared to hand-drawn graphics, GRAP] 
can save you enough money on your first set 
overlays to pay for itself. And over the course of a 




few months, it could save you enough to pay for the 
Apple® computer system it works on. And that includes a 
Hewlett-Packard 7470A color plotter. 

It even works with VisiCalc® files. 

GRAPH is so flexible it allows you to work with raw 
data, other members of the PFS Series, or even VisiCalc files. 

No other computer graphics package gives you all this 
capability. Combine it with the beautiful simplicity of PFS 
for information management, and PFS: REPORT for infor- 
ation analysis, and you have a software family that works 
hard without being hard to work. 

So if you're Slinking about making it in pic- 
tures, go see PFS: GRAPH. It's at your computer 
dealer now. And if they don't have it, ask them to 
contact Software Publishing Corporation, 1901 
Landings Drive, Mountain View, CA 94043.

Ever wonder how gruds and gleep- 
noks got their names? Or where Oo- 
Topos is located? Or what the derivation 
of Snoggle is? We don't know, but we do 
know that there are a lot of words and 
names in Appledom whose geneses are 
obscured by our immediate association 
of them with our microcomputers. Some 
of their origins lie in history; some are as 
close as your pocket dictionary. 

For example, more often than not, 
when someone says "integer," we think 
first of a high-level language rather than 
of the numbers, -1, 0, 1, 2, and so on, just 
as "novation" conjures images of 
modem hardware, rather than the legal 
substitution of contracts or agreements. 

This month's contest will help you re- 
member (or teach you, if you don't al- 
ready know) where some of these Apple- 
associated names came from. Below are 
twenty riddles. The object is to fig- 
ure out the word or words referred to by 
the clues. Some of the answers are the 
names of software products, some are 
the names of companies related to Ap- 
ples, and others are simply Apple-re- 
lated proper names. 

Some of the clues are definitions of the 
answers ; others are definitions of words 
that themselves are clues to the an- 
swers. So if you think you have solved the 
given clue but it just doesn't make sense, 
then push on further. 

Each puzzle is worth at least two 
points; one for the answer to the clue, 
and one for the name of the product, com- 
pany, or proper name it refers to. An- 
swers that require two clues being solved 
are worth three points. Make sure you 
give complete names in your final an- 
swer, and that they're spelled correctly. 
Incomplete or misspelled answers won't 
count. 

Example : 

a) Henry Ford's and assembler. 
Answers: assembly line, Assembly 

Lines: The Book (2 points). "Assembly 
lines," or "Assembly Line," as a final an- 
swer would not be acceptable. 

b) Spike and Snoopy. 

Answers: beagle brothers, Beagle 
Bros (2 points). As a final answer, "Bea- 
gle Brothers" wouldn't count, as the cor- 
rect spelling is "Bros." 

The winner will receive $100 in goods 
from Softalk advertisers. In case of a tie, 
contestants will be churned through Ap- 
ple's random number generator. The 
lone sur'vivor will be the winner. 

A prize worth $50 will be awarded if 
someone makes an equally good case for 
an alternate answer or answers to those 
intended; in the event of more than one 
such entry, that deemed cleverest and 
most reasonable by Sof talk's contest 



staff will take this consolation prize. 



1) 



flying in your spacecraft 
some saw-toothed moun- 



Imagine 
through 
tains. 

2) The Romans worshipped her at cock- 
crow. Sleepytime girl? 

3) These sentries are definitely ahead 
of their time. 

4) A pattern of horizontal lines that 
form on a television screen when no 
signal is received. Especially visible 
if one tilts slightly. 

5) This Titan stole fire from the 
heavens and gave it to mankind. I 
read it in a chain letter. 

6) A large keyboard instrument with 
steam whistles, foimd in most carni- 
vals and amusement parks. 

7) Hi! I'm Peggy. Fly me to Coarse- 
gold. 

8) Computer gaming, in Brazzaville? 

9) Lassie was one. So is Benji. 

10) The air defense in North America 
neither takes nor adds to its power. 

11) Having lived alone in the Arabian des- 
ert for over five hundred years, this 
creature burned itself, only to rise 
again — but in Illinois? 

12) German sausage? We're stalking to 
kill about two thousand pounds' 
worth. 

13) Like 1-1-1=3, for example. 

14) In the valley, carries twice the 
weight as N. 

15) Five shillings for a hard day's work. 

16) A remarkable historic period. Like 
the era of the confused pharaoh. 

17) In theory, what protons are made of. 
Just ask Richard Benjamin or Chris 
Jochumson. 

18) Describes an alien creature that is in- 
telligent, feeling, aware. Even if he's 
half 'n' half. 

19) When translated into Greek, the 
name of the main character in an ad- 
venture game becomes the name of 
the main character in a Greek 
literary work — the title of which is 
the name of another adventure. 
Whew! 

20) You can get stoned with this woman 
of serpentine hair, but don't get car- 
ried away.

Contest Winners: 

Crossword Rings a Bell 



Man in the Moon: Wayne Lux, of 
Omaha, Nebraska, came up the winner 
of the April contest. 

Lux, like many other entrants, didn't 
complete the crossword after identifying 
the missing quotation, "Mr. Watson, 
come here, I want you." He and 126 other 
entrants correctly identified the quote, 
the speaker as Alexander Graham Bell, 
the situation in which Bell spilled acid 
and yelled for help from his assistant who 
heard Bell's voice through the instru- 
ment, and the statement's significance as 
the first intelligible, if accidental, tele- 
phone communication. The random num- 
ber generator plucked Lux's name from 
the pile of correct entries, and the Ne- 
braskan will receive one hundred dollars' 
worth of software through his local 
dealer. Computer Works of Bellevue, 
Nebraska. He plans to purchase DOS 
Tool Kit and Hi-Res Computer Golf. 

Another fifteen entrants correctly un- 
puzzled our spacey anagram and pun 
crossword and were eligible to win copies 
of Crossword Magic, the program that 
made it all possible. The random num- 
ber generator went round and round 
again and came up with five bonus prize 
winners: Mike Leggett (Madison, WI) ; 
Ernest Sams (Bellingham, WA) ; Ethan 
Starr (Amherst, MA) ; and Deidre Ya- 
cich (New Orleans, LA). Tony Jeffries of 
Denver, Colorado, told us he already had 
a copy of Crossword Magic, so he'll re- 
ceive another program through his deal- 
er. Computer Land of South Denver, in- 
stead. 

For those still puzzled over the cross- 
word, here's the complete solution:

INTRODUaNG 

MKROBUFFER. 



NOW YOU CAN USE YOUR PRINTER 
WITHOUT WASTING COMPUTER TIML 



As you know, your computer 
drives your printer. And when it's 
performing this function, you 
can't use it for anything else. 

A program that takes fifteen 
minutes to print makes you wait 
fifteen minutes before you can 
compute again. And if it takes 
two hours to print, you wait two 
hours. 

A waste of valuable time. 

THE NEW MKROBUFFER^ 
INCREASES YOUR EFFICIENa. 

Microbuffer allows you to print 
and process simultaneously. No 
waiting! 

MKROBUFFER 
ACCEPTS PRINTING DATA 

AS FAST AS YOUR 
COMPUnRCANSENDIT. 

Microbuffer first stores the data 
in its own memory buffer and 
then takes control of your printer. 
This frees the computer for more 
productive functions. 

Additional output may be 
dumped to the buffer at any time 
and it will be printed in turn. 



MICROBUFFER WILL 
SPEED UP ANY PROGRAM 
THAT REQUIRES PRINTING. 

The full line of Microbuffers is 
designed to accommodate 
virtually any computer/printer 
combination. 

Microbuffers are available in 
Centronics-compatible parallel or 
RS-232C serial versions. 

FOR APPLE II COMPUTERS, 
Microbuffer II features on-board 
firmware for text formatting and 
advanced graphics dump 
routines. Both serial and parallel 
versions have very low power 
consumption. Special functions 
include Basic listing formatter, 
self-test, buffer zap, and 
transparent and maintain modes. 
The 16K model is priced at $259 
and the 32K, at $299. 

FOR EPSON PRINTERS, Microbuffer 
starts at $159 in either an 8K 
serial or a 16K parallel version. 
The serial buffer supports both 
hardware handshaking and XON- 
XOFF/ETX-ACK software hand- 
shaking at baud rates up to 
19,200. Both Epson interfaces are 
compatible with all Epson com- 
mands including GRAFTRAX-80. 
Both are user-expandable to 32K. 



Both serial and parallel versions 
are expandable up to 256K. The 
serial stand-alone will support 
different input and output baud 
rates and handshake protocol. 
The 32K model starts at $299, 
64K for $349. 64K add-ons for up 
to a total of 256K are just 
$179.00. 

SIMPLE 10 INSTALL. 

Microbuffer II, being slot- 
independent, will fit into any slot 
directly inside the Apple except 
zero. 

Microbuffer for your Epson 
mounts easily in the existing 
auxiliary slot directly inside the 
Epson printer. 

The stand-alone Microbuffer is 
installed in-line between virtually 
any computer and any printer. 

MICROBUFFER FROM

When you think of how much 

time Microbuffer will save, 

can you afford to not have one?

What if you're having 
to clean floppy 
drhfe heads 
too often? 




Ask for SYNCOM diskettes, 
with burnished Ectype' coating and 
dust-absorbing jacket liners. 



As your floppy drive writes or 
reads, a Syncom disl<ette is 
working four ways to keep loose 
particles and dust fronn causing 
soft errors, dropouts. 

Cleaning agents on the burnished 
surface of the Ectype®coating 
actually remove build-up from 
the head, while lubricating it at 
the same time. 

A carbon additive drains away 
static electricity before it can 
attract dust or lint. 

Strong binders hold the signal- 
carrying oxides tightly within the 
coating. 

And the non-woven jacket liner. 




more than just wiping the sur- 
face, provides thousands of tiny 
pockets to keep what it collects. 

Liner collects and 
"pockets" loose 
particles 

Tightly bonded 
milled ferrous 
oxides 

Head-cleaning and 
anti-static agents

Every Apple Is Created Equal. 
But It Doesn't HaveTo Stay That Way. 



An Apple''^' is really something. 

But from now on, it's going to be 
something much more. How come? 
Simple. We're introducing three 
revolutionary new data communica- 
tion packages, called Transend''^', 
designed especially to make your 
Apple 11''^' rise above all others. 

Our lYansend data communica- 
tions software provides access to in- 
formation utilities; complete file 
transmission of charts, VisiCalc ''"^' 
reports, and entire programs; as well 
as all electronic mail functions. 

Transend comes in three different 
versions. You can begin economically 
with the simplest form, Transend 1, 
an intelligent terminal/file transfer 
system. As your needs increase, you 
can move up to two other l>ansend 
packages, without worrying about 
retraining or repurchasing. Transend 
2 gives any Apple II intelligent ter- 
minal capabihties, plus file transfer 
with complete error detection and 



automatic retransmission for de- 
manding business applications. 
Transend 3 incorporates electronic 
mail— with password security, text 
editing, mailbox with mailstop, unat- 
tended scheduling and receiving, 
automatic redialing, and much more. 



The Transformation People 



lYansend's support of most popu- 
lar Apple II "add-in" cards and 
modems lets you upgrade your 
Apple without hassle or unnecessary 
expense. And you'll immediately cut 
operating costs by as much as 30% 
with simple, easy-to-use menus, data 
compression and 1200-baud modem 
support. 

Nobody on the personal computer 
scene today is offering the speed, flex- 
ibility, and reliability of Transend in 
a single upgradable software system. 

Don't miss this chance to uplift 
your Apple II. Contact us or your 
dealer for all the delicious details.

^ most important peripheral for your 

Apple 11. 






I 



JUST CLIPS ON. 
NO MOUNTING OR 
HARDWARE REQUIRED. 

COLOR MATCHED TO 
APPLE II. 



For Cooling 



As soon as you move to 64K RAM or 
80 columns you need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral cards 
generate more heat. In addition, the cards 
block any natural air flow through the Apple 
II creating high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the cards and 
the computer itself. 

SYSTEM SAVER provides correct 
cooling. An efficient, quiet fan draws fresh 
air across the mother board, over the power 
supply and out the side ventilation slots. 




For Line Surge 
Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides essential 
protection to hardware and data from 
dangerous, power surges and spikes. 

By connecting the Apple II power 
input through the SYSTEM SAVER, power 
is controlled in two ways: 1) Dangerous 
voltage spikes are clipped off at a safe 130 
volt RMS level. 2) High frequency noise is 
smoothed out before reaching the Apple II. 




For Operating 
Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two switched 
power outlets. As shown in the diagram, 
the SYSTEM SAVER efficiently organizes 
your system so that one convenient, front 
mounted power switch controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple II, monitor and printer The 
heavy duty switch has a pilot light to alert 
when system is on. You'll never use the 
Apple power switch again!

FORMAT-II turns your Apple II into a 
powerful and effective word processor. If you 
are not familiar with computers or, for tfiat 
matter, with word processors, do not worry. 

The Apple and FORIVIAT-II behave like a 
typewriter in some ways, but instead of 
printing directly on your paper, your typing stores 
information directly in the computer memory. 
Once it's in the memory, it can be displayed 
on the screen and, more importantly, it can be 
edited, reorganized, or fed out to a printer. 
Furthermore, the information - your text - can 
be stored away safely on a floppy disk. ■

Discovery of a Menacing Message 

When I came into work this morning, I 
found the following letter to Softalk lying 
upon my desk. My years of surveillance 
of The Island and its rulers for my ex- 
pose The Prisoner allow me to say with 
confidence that this message was indeed 
written by The Caretaker. 

This is the second time that he has left 
me such a message, once again some- 
how getting past the locked doors and 
alarm systems of Edu- Ware's offices. In 
the interests of keeping the public aware

The Message 

As caretaker of The Island in The 
Prisoner, I have a particular fondness 
for ambiguities. Therefore, I was highly 
amused by your April issue in which a 
letter appeared that was written by one 
of our islanders. Number 24 (Victor De 
Grande). 

Number 24 lamented in his letter over 
the twenty-four bugs that had infested 
Crystalware's Sands of Mars. "But," he 
wrote, "since I had just played The 
Prisoner, I was prepared for anjdhing." 

It is gratifying to know that we did 
such a good job of preparing Number 24. 
Did he mean that he also found bugis in 
The Prisoner? Or did he mean that our 
brainwashing techniques have condi- 
tioned him to always be prepared for 
frustration and disappointment? A little 
knowledge is such a dangerous thing. 
Well, it seems that the only way to have 
your readers' minds cleared on this mat- 
ter is to have them pay a little visit to our 
facilities. I assure you that we can do as 
well for them as we did for Number 24. 

Allow me to take this opportunity to 
make two announcements. First, we 
have elected a new recruitment direc- 
tor: Number 24. And second, we are 
renovating our facilities. Everything is 
getting a new paint job in thirty-two hi- 
res colors, and new locks are being put on 
the doors. I dare say you will never want 
to leave.

The Winning Answer 

I want to take this opportunity to thank 
Sirius Software for sponsoring their Chet 
and David Softalk contest. As you may

suspect, I was one of the winners. My 
prize arrived today and I have enjoyed 
plajdng Kabul Spy. The gpraphlcs are ex- 
cellent and the program responds very 
fast to commands. I hope your magazine 
will continue such contests and other soft- 
ware manufacturers will participate.

Enhanced and Supported 

Now I've just got to put in a good word 
for Videx. Having purchased and in- 
stalled a Videoterm eighty-column board 
and a Keyboard and Display Enhancer, I 
found that the enhancer did not work. I 
also found that the the keyboard encoder 
chip in my revision four Apple was ap- 
parently in the IC socket when it was 
originally soldered to the encoder circuit 
board. I had to buy a whole new "piggry- 
back" keyboard and my Videx Enhanc- 
er was not the proper one for my newer 
keyboard. The good folks at Videx took 
pity on me, I guess, because they sent me 
one of their just-hit-the-market Enhanc- 
er lis. They also sent me a small board 
with a chip on it that would work in my 
half new, half old Apple. None of it cost 
me a penny more than I had paid for the 
original Enhancer. If that isn't support, I 
don't know what is! Their technical serv- 
ice people are also very knowledgeable 
and helpful, and the Enhancer II is 
fantastic !

Amazing Mall Order 

Unfortunately, our industry seems to be 
a seller's market. Almost anyone can set 
up a small business, and stay afloat long 
enough to lure several of us (often more 
than a few) into sending money to order a 
product mail order. All of us have heard 
what can happen to that money. It might 
disappear entirely, or, at best take weeks 
or months before the product is re- 
ceived. Service, support, and quality 
seem to be words (and concepts) forgot- 
ten by altogether too many of the compa- 
nies we do business with. 

Because of this dim record, I almost 
always buy from a local dealer whom I 
can deal with face to face if I have any 
questions or problems. Recently, I de- 
parted from this rule of thumb to pur- 
chase ribbon cartridge refills for my Ep- 
son MX-80 printer. As the company that I 
ordered from. Data Systems in Fern 
Park, Florida, is about as far away from 
my Washington address as you can get 



within the U.S., I expected a long wait for 
crisp, dark listings. Amazingly, I re- 
ceived my order eight days after I mailed 
it! This company is truly a gem. If only 
the larger companies would follow their 
example. Not only are they incredibly 
fast, but I can buy six refills for the price 
of one new cartridge here in the Seattle 
area. 

I will surely do business with Data 
Systems again, and heartily recommend 
them to anyone else contemplating "roll- 
ing their own" Epson ribbon refills. 
Terry Owen Permenter, Seattle, WA 

Counting on the Accountant 

Since I first heard about my program 
The Accountant by Decision Support 
Software in your publication, I thought 
you might be interested in my use and 
subsequent comments. I wanted a sys- 
tem that would allow me to keep track of 
my personal affairs. It was also planned 
that this software would enable me to 
function as treasurer of one church, and 
assist the treasurer of a second church in 
keeping track of expenses. I didn't ex- 
pect it to keep books for a large or 
medium-sized business; it only had to 
perform the functions of a general 
ledger. I preferred a double-entry sys- 
tem. 

The Accountant is great and meets all 
of my needs. I'm keeping my personal 
accounts and checking, and managing 
the budget without problems. I am also 
keeping books for the churches without 
difficulty, and since the system inter- 
faces with VisiCalc, I can use it with budg- 
et projections. It has also turned out to 
be suitable for keeping the books of a fair- 
ly substantial AM-FM radio station — 
something more than I bargained for. A 
few minor glitches in the manual were 
promptly cleared up by strong author 
support. Best of all was the price. The 
little one hundred dollars system (plus 
twenty dollars for the VisiCalc inter- 
face) does what programs costing much 
more say they will do.

Calling for a Recount 

I have just purchased the Home Ac- 
countant as potential replacement for the 
Personal Finance Manager which, with 
its predecessor, I have been using for 
several years both for home use and for 
support of a small business. I have been 
looking for several improvements in 
Home Accountant as it seemed to be the 
ideal next step. However, it has several 
shortcomings which would seem to pre- 
clude it from being valuable for serious 
users. Unfortunately I did not know of 
them before purchase. 

First, Home Accountant does not pro- 
vide deletion ability. This means that 
mistaken entries may only be edited, 
zeroed, and/or designated "no cate- 
gory." They will always show up in 
searches and are each counted aa a 



JULY 1982 



21 



transaction. 

Second, I discovered during the trial 
run that the transaction entry mode ac- 
cepts data only for the month listed at the 
screen top. Even entries I used with dif- 
ferent month numbers were stored in the 
same record. This means that if an in- 
correct entry was sought in the entry 
month it might not be found. 

Third, when a month is closed, no 
further transaction entries are allowed in 
that month. While the reason given was 
that it was felt that inexperienced users 
would be less likely to make mistakes, it 
would seem to me that it takes more 
knowledge and experience to bypass this 
problem than to provide full editing ca- 
pabilities for correcting errors. The 
method suggested was to add several 
"ghost" entries each month which could 
be used later if needed. Too bad this was 
not mentioned in the manual. 

Fourth, I have not been able to estab- 
lish the correct codes to send to my 
Microline 82 printer. I notice that Conti- 
nental Software disclaims support to other 
than specific interface cards and print- 
ers. Unfortunately, purchase is neces- 
sary to discover this note. 

Overall, these limitations would seem 
to prohibit the serious use of the pro- 
gram. I tried to imagine the rationale 
which would lead to such a design. Ac- 
countants used to use ink so that a page 
could not be altered. Of course that didn't 
stop page replacement and duplicate sets 
of books. One of the great powers of the 
computer is not to eliminate errors, but 
to allow recalculation or correction so 
rapidly that the net result is much great- 
er efficiency. This is the basis for editing 
capabilities in word processors and data 
base management systems. This hardly 
seemed a justification for the system 
design. 

I feel that Continental Software did 
not evaluate the competition well. Per- 
sonal Finance Manager, for example, is 
very nearly error proof and friendly. It 
includes complete editing capability 
(even to prior months) except dviring rec- 
oncilation. I must conclude that Home 
Accountant must be revised to allow full 
utilization of its really powerful features. 
I feel it has been misrepresented in its 
capabilities and has inadequate 
documentation to support either the 
novice or the small-business user. It is 
too bad that reviewers have overlooked 
these shortcomings. I have returned the 
software for a refund. 
Norman J. Wood, Saratoga, CA 

Market Balk 

I have a few complaints for the major 
software producers. 

Broderbund: How dare you advertise 
a product for seven months in advance 
and then tell us that it will be available in 
April. I ha ve yet to see it in any stores. Also, 
here's a trick for those of you who have 
Red Alert. While the logo is loading in, 
press and hold the reset button until you 



get the text screen. Very, very tricky. 

On-Llne and Sir-tech: Releasing a 
product with so many bugs as to force a 
recall is just unbearable. We pay a large 
enough price — we should get quality. 
Hey, On-Line, how about including a 
write-protect or bugging diskette with 
no notch cut. All you have to do is lower 
the write-protect arm. 

And lastly, not a complaint but a com- 
pliment to Sirius Software. I commend 
you on your efforts to write software and 
then advertise it only when you are sure 
it is done. It is for this that I and many 
other software consumers are grateful. 
Tom Borjon, Anchorage, AK 

A Couple of Disgruntled Partners 

I have just completed reading a letter re- 
garding Denver Software and their 
Financial Partner program in Open Dis- 
cussion of May 1982. We are a systems 
house dealer, using the Financial Part- 
ner and have had difficulty with Denver 
Software. We had sent several letters to 
no avail. We requested a new disk to 
make backups and in trying the proce- 
dure could not complete the process and 
go on to the next year. 

How is a dealer to help the potential 
customer if Denver Software will not 
help the dealer? 

We are, of course, sorry that Mr. 
Abrams had difficulties, but at the same 
time glad to hear that someone else was 
having the same difficulties with the 
company that we did. 
Paul A.Huard, Jr., Mountain Center, CA 

A letter appeared in your May 1982 issue 
signed by Stephen Abrams of San Diego. 
I would like to echo his letter since I have 
had an almost identical experience. The 
fact only one set of books can be run with 
the Financial Partner from Denver Soft- 
ware is a very poor way to supply a prod- 
uct. I think it is unrealistic to expect 
someone with no accounting experience 
to set up a set of books properly the first 
time. I think there must be some provi- 
sion to start over after the first few un- 
successful tries, especially in a program 
that is advertised as being suitable for 
people with no accounting experience. I 
believe their advertisements even imply 
that this program is a suitable tool for 
learning accounting principles. 

I was interested by Mr. Abrams's 
fourth comment that the company im- 
plied that it was the dealer's responsibil- 
ity to inform the prospective customer of 
the program's limitations. I ordered this 
product straight from the company, paid 
full retail price, and was given no such in- 
formation. In summary, I would join Mr. 
Abrams in strongly recommending that 
your readers not purchase this product.

Just a Moment 

Like so many novice computer owners I 
have made a number of mistakes in the 
purchase of software. Advertisements 



are very nice but often misleading. 
Editorials are helpful, but often mislead- 
ing. So the only way to find out actually 
what you have is to use it. I have two Ap- 
ple computers, one for a small business 
and one for home use. I would like to 
share my experience with a software pro- 
gram. 

Every Apple owner is given a pro- 
gram called File Cabinet which is soon 
outgrown. My first attempt at a data- 
base system was CCA Data Base Man- 
agement by the maker of VisiCalc. Since 
VisiCalc is so good I thought CCA Data 
Base Management had to be good. Well, 
it wasn't. When you bum one hundred 
dollars you tend to be more careful, so I 
investigated a number of popular, highly 
advertised programs and found each of 
them lacking. Then I heard of a program 
by Software Technology for Computers 
out of Massachusetts. I discussed the pro- 
gram with their sales people and was told 
if I liked File Cabinet I would love the 
IFO (Information File Organizer). So I 
ordered it, and, as promised, I loved /FO. 

Again, let me repeat that I am not a 
computer expert. I run a small business 
so I know how to read, write, and count; 
beyond that, difficulties arise. Very soon 
I wanted to expand my data base to do 
other neat things but didn't know how to 
do it. So a quick call to Gary Haffer, a few 
phone conversations, and I had a system 
customized to my industry and my 
unique needs. 

I am writing this with the hope that

other users will take just a moment to 
write to say if a program is good or bad 
for their needs. I would be willing to an- 
swer any inquiries as to what I liked or 
disliked about the program and would 
hope that the thousands of other Apple 
users will begin to do the same. I would 
encourage your magazine to open such a 
forum for publication. In this way we can 
enhance the use of the computers for our 
business and personal lives and remove 
some of the expenses and frustrations 
that are naturally inherent to such a tech- 
nical field. 

G.R. Prasch, Huntington, IN 
Docu-Drama 

While I am in sympathy with D.J. Groudy 
and his unfortunate experience with in- 
adequate dealer documentation, the fact 
is that until consumers insist on com- 
plete documentation before purchase, 
vendors will continue to rely on adver- 
tisements. I have written to several soft- 
ware vendors requesting a complete 
functional description of a particular 
package and have yet to receive infor- 
mation which is sufficiently complete for 
me to evaluate the package. As long as 
vendors can sell their products through 
advertisements and charge the buyer in 
advance for adequate documentation, 
they will continue to do so. When pro- 
spective buyers insist on adequate docu- 
mentation before purchase, they'll get it. 
F. Michael Hugo, Arlington, VA 



A Notion To Trust 

I would like to thank the readers of 
Softalk and other magazines for the very 
positive response to Penguin Software's 
policy change with regard to protected 
software. 

I'm certain that we made a good deci- 
sion, and so far the move has had no 
negative effect on our sales. This doesn't 
mean that every publisher should go out 
and remove their protection immedi- 
ately; that's a decision that has to be 
made with time. It takes a certain 
amount of trust in your customers to take 
such a step. I happen to think that it's 
helpful for any customer to have work- 
ing backups of software that they pur- 
chase, as long as they keep the copies 
themselves. I also occasionally have this 
silly notion that everyone is honest if you 
treat them as such. I like to think that 99 
percent are. 

Mr. J. Barry Smith's letters in the 
May Softalk, and other people's various 
letters and comments elsewhere in the 
world, lead me to believe that in order 
not to be dishonest people, they twist 
their morals with rationalizations in 
which they try to keep themselves honest 
in their own minds. "To quote Mr. Smith, 
"Piracy is a biased word, it implies 
theft." Sorry. It doesn't imply theft. It is 
theft. There are no two ways about it. 
When you take something that doesn't be- 
long to you, it's got a simple one-word 
definition: stealing. 



"But," you say, "it's so expensive." Sorry 
again. Yes, selling Apple software is 
mass marketing as far as computers go, 
but it's not really that huge of a market- 
place. Would it surprise you to know that 
advertising costs us about $6,000 per 
month? Or that most publishers are paid 
only forty percent of the retail price after 
distributors and dealers get their cut? 
What about packaging, people to take 
and ship orders, customer service, office 
space and supplies? Dale Archibald was 
an order of magnitude or so off when he 
jokingly said that we're so small that it 
takes weeks for our distribution to reach 
double figures (Softalk, May) ; but even 
so, it doesn't take a mathematical wizard 
to compute rough sales figures to see how 
much money actually finds its way to the 
publisher and author. For the most part, 
software packages are priced close to 
what they have to be. Sorry. 

So Barry, your excuse is your wallet. 
Do you buy gasoline without paying? Do 
you leave restaurants without paying the 
check? Do you stuff your pockets in the 
supermarket? It doesn't make any dif- 
ference who you steal from, it's still steal- 
ing. If that's the definition of a pirate, 
then yes, you're a thief. And if you steal 
because you can't afford the software 
then you had no business buying a com- 
puter in the first place. 

To the 99.9 percent of you who are 
honest, thank you for your kind words 
and support. 

P.S. Despite the column bio, I taught at 
Northern Illinois U. in DeKalb, home of 
the famous flying ears of com. Is there 
an arcade game in that somewhere?

Thunderstorm 

I have just received my new copy of 
Softalk for May 1982, and noticed the 
Thunderware advertisement. I read a. 
similar ad last year and received one of 
their clocks as a Christmas present, pur- 
chased through ComputerLand. After 
working many hours and driving many 
miles back and forth to ComputerLand, I 
still have a useless clock. 

I have written Thunderware pre- 
viously and they assured me that if I 
would go back to the seller that they 
could contact the company and it would 
work. This has been done and they have 
shipped me a disk with instructions to 
make it work. I have installed the driver 
as instructed, but the disk will still not 
boot. I have been back to ComputerLand 
and they tell me that they are sorry, but 
they don't know what to do with it. They 
have been more than helpful in trying to 
solve the problem, but there appears to 
be no solution. 

I am sorry, but I feel that I have been 
ripped off with this product. I feel that 
anyone who reads the advertisement in 
Softalk has a right to expect a product 
that will do what is stated. I find no ref- 
erence to the fact that the product will

not work in an Apple III, and feel that it

John Florence, M.D., Oklahoma City, OK 
Mad Scientist 

I have an applications problem with 
VisiCalc. I am a scientist and I pur- 
chased VisiCalc for scientific, not busi- 
ness, applications. That is, I wish to use it 
as a report generator for presenting ex- 
perimental data. 

VisiCalc drops trailing zeroes. For ex- 
ample, 3.210 becomes 3.21. To a scientist 
those numbers are not identical. The 
extra zero indicates the level of experi- 
mental precision. VisiCalc does not line 
up decimals. This can make a column of 
figures look ludicrous and totally unac- 
ceptable for a final report. All columns 
must be the same width. This makes it 
awkward to use row titles. I can cir- 
cumvent this problem by using two 
columns for a title, but it is inconvenient. 
VisiCalc doesn't have a problem with 
keeping trailing zeroes or even adding 
them in the money format field. If I have 
either more than two or less than two 
decimal places, I'm out of luck. 

I understand that their main compet- 
itor, SuperCalc, has solved all of these 
problems. What has happened to 
VisiCalc? They seem to be quite smug 
about their success and could care less 
about their past customers. I called them 
recently asking if they had any plans on 
coming out with an eighty-column up- 
date and they said no. With my forty- 
column display, I frequently am 
frustrated by not seeing enough of my 
sheet. I am aware that VC-Expand/80 is 
on the market, but I am reluctant to buy 
until my previously mentioned problems 
are solved.

Teenage Turnabout 

DOStalk — Wow! When I saw your new 
feature was written by one of my favor- 
ite authors, Bert Kersey, I knew that 
your already great magazine would be- 
come even greater. As expected, the 
April 1982 issue of DOStalk taught me 
many things which I did not know. These 
things added to what Bert Kersey had 
already taught me when I bought DOS 
Boss. 

You may not know it, but I am a teen- 
ager who cannot afford many programs. 
The truth is that I cannot even afford a 
few programs. Coincidentally, the last 
program that I have bought is DOS Boss, 
and that was in November 1981 ! 

To my surprise, instead of new ideas 
such as in the April issue, the May issue 
ripped me off. Four of the utilities on the 
DOS Boss disk, that I had paid for with 
my hard earned money, were fully ex- 
plained and listed in the May issue of 



DOStalk. Never again will I buy a pro- 
gram from Bert Kersey, the man who, at 
least in my eyes, has gone from a prince 
to a pooper!

Issues and Answers 

I might be able to help with some Open 
Discussion problems. 

For both inserting names and under- 
lining with Apple Writer get Apple Writer 
Extended Features, Brillig Systems, 
10270 Fern Pool Court, Burke, VA 22015. 
It is great for underlining, making exec 
files, modifying text files, adding printer 
controls in the text, and other things that I 
don't use. The author is most helpful 
when you have a question. This item was 
reviewed in your pages several issues 
ago. 

Regarding bypassing the UHF of a 
Heath Television, considering all the 
problems I've had with my Heath, the 
problem is probably in the set. I would 
contact ATV Research, Thirteenth and 
Broadway, Dakota City, NE 68731, to see 
if they could help. I use their Micro- 
verter and get a sharper picture than 
with Super-Mod. Micro-verter is for 
UHF, but perhaps the company has a 
suggestion. 

I still think you should put all the pom 
ads on one page. It could readily be rip- 
ped out by those (like me) who would 
rather not have it in the magazine. 

To Mr. Robbins in Open Discussion, 
probably either Disk Fixer (from Image 
Computer Products) or Bag of Tricks 



(from Quality Software) will straighten 
out his directory. I had somebody who 
knows more than I do fix a blown disk for 
me using Disk Fixer. I now have the pro- 
gram, but a lot of it is over my head. 

Why, when reading a long data file, 
does my Apple occasionally just sit there 
and seem to do nothing? This seems to be 
most apt to happen with File Cabinet, but 
I have had it happen on other programs 
that I don't use as much. 

Finally, a request : How about another 
review of data storage programs like 
VisiCalc?

Second Opinion 

I would like to share my opinions on the 
letter titled "Ten Hours" in Open Dis- 
cussion, April Softalk. Mr. Behrens 
handed the secret to the copy protection 
of Wizardry on a silver platter to all Sof- 
talk readers. I'm not upset that Mr. Behr- 
ens discovered how to copy Wizardry, but 
the fact that Softalk printed it in their 
magazine destroys a quite effective copy 
protection. 

I've played Wizardry since it was put 
out, and I haven't had the slightest prob- 
lem. I have used the utility options and 
not only found them useful, but they've 
always worked fine. I think Mr. Behr- 
en's problem might have been a faulty 
system or misuse. 

The real issue to me is whether or not 
Softalk has the right to give away infor- 
mation on copy protection. May I sug-

gest getting the proper permission next

Piece of the Pie 

In the May issue of Softalk you had a let- 
ter from Marlys Dannenberg stating that 
the various print codes for the MX-80 
printer could be entered from within the 
word processor Apple PIE. I have looked 
at the Apple PIE manual and do not see 
where I can access these codes. Can you 
tell me how to accomplish this? 
Norman Massey, Tucson, AZ 

Poking Punctuation 

I really enjoy your magazine and would 
like to tell you to keep up the good work. I 
especially enjoy the reviews of software 
and the tutorials. I have been reading 
your publication since the first issue 
(saving them too) , and have been await- 
ing the chance to contribute something to 
your outstanding effort. 

I am one of the "young people" men- 
tioned by Albert E. Hoffman in his letter 
to Open Discussion in April (I am foior- 
teen years old), and I hope this routine 
will help many people, yoimg and old 
alike, who enjoy Softalk. 

This routine will allow input of quotes, 
commas, and colons in Applesoft. It 
pokes a small machine language pro- 
gram into memory from 768- 805 ($300- 
$325) . It was originally published in the 
October 1979 issue of Contact. I have 
modified the routine to correct a serious 
error that existed in the original routine. 
(The ASCII values of the inputted char- 
acters were all 128 too high.) 

In the revised routine, line 10 defines a 
string variable at a known memory loca- 
tion (the name may be anything you 
wish). Lines 90-190 poke a short ma- 
chine langiiage routine into your Apple's 
memory pointer to point to the input buf- 
fer ($200). Line 240 calls the new input 
routine, and the mid$ function moves a 
copy of the new string into main memo- 
ry (so it isn't erased by the next input) . 

This routine works for Applesoft in- 
put as well as for input from a disk. In or- 
der to read the third field of each record 
of a random access text file, the syntax 
would be: 

CALL 768: CALL 768: CALL 768: IN$=MID$(IN$,1) 

The first two calls are dummy Inputs, but 
unlike the normal input in$ command, 
they perform no string handling. This 
stops "garbage collection" as a side 
benefit. Have fun!

Six Times Time 

I recently purchased Time Zone and 
found only six disks instead of the eight 
disks that were mentioned in one of your 
reviews. A quick call to On- Line Systems 
relieved my anxiety. There are only six 
disks (both sides) to the game. Just 
thought you might want to save your 
readers a long distance call.

Good for Something 

Can anyone tell me what the program In 
the April Basic Solution Is supposed to 
do? I read Wm. V.R. Smith's description 
and couldn't understand it, but it sound- 
ed like he was talking about something 
useful. I entered the program in my 
Apple and ran it. (I substituted a right 
parenthesis for a right bracket in line 
twenty-nine, as I didn't know about shift 
M. My son told me later.) I can't see any 
point to the output I got. 

Perhaps Mr. Smith could put a few 
more minutes' time into writing his next 
column. For one thing, in lines fourteen 
and ninety the print instruction can be re- 
placed by the much simpler PR# in- 
structions used directly.

Escaping in Two Directions 

Here is the information Mr. Stokes re- 
quested regarding bidirectional printing 
on the NEC Model 5515 printer. The first 
reference is NEC document number 
10003-01 entitled Terminal Operators 
Guide. See Appendix B, page Bl: es- 
cape- 5 = forward print, escape-6 = re- 
verse print. The second reference is NEC 
document number 10005, second revision 
February 1980, entitled Terminals Prod- 
uct Description. See page 4-10, para- 
graph 4.6.1.8: reverse print = escape-6, 
forward print - escape-5 or a carriage 
return. A carriage return will cancel re- 
verse print, so escape-5 Is not really re- 



quired if the line printed right to left ends 
in a carriage return. 

It also should be obvious that each line 
to be printed right to left must be pre- 
ceded by an escape-6. The 5515 printer 
does not have the capability to automati- 
cally reverse the line of characters to be 
printed. The user is responsible for this 
task plus any pad spaces to suit margins. 
Chuck Welman, Santa Ana, CA 

Stumped by a Stop 

To Jim Merritt: I have a problem using 
Apple Pascal that I have been unable to 
solve. After a program has been assem- 
bled and starts to execute. It halts and 
displays the following: 

Value Range Error 

s#i, p#6, m 

The only way I can re-enter Apple 
Pascal is re-lnltializing by hitting reset. 
The only reference I can find to this type 
of error message is in the Apple Pascal 
Operating System Reference Manual on 
page 278, and it doesn't really say much 
of anything about it. I have no idea what 
this error message means, what the 
problem is, or how to solve It. Would you 
please help me with this?

Wondering Al)out Renumbering 

When programming in Apple III Busi- 
ness Basic, I miss having an editor fea- 
ture that is available in large computer 
editors: the renum function for renum- 
bering program lines and references to 
line numbers (by branching state- 
ments). Neither the simple Basic editor, 
nor the more powerful Pascal editor pro- 
vided by Apple have renum. I feel that 
when writing long, complex programs 
this is a necessary feature. Any sugges- 
tions ?

Repaying a Debt with Checltsum 

I have taken a great deal of enjoyment In 
reading your magazine for the past few 
years. I feel that I owe you a debt for all 
that I have learned from your pages. 
When a letter arrives in my post office 
box requesting a few dollars to extend 
my subscription, I will joyfully send off a 
check. 

Enclosed is a program that I hope will 
repay part of my debt. This modest pro- 
gram calculates a checksum for the con- 
tents of a range of memory addresses. If 
the range is larger than sixty- four bytes, 
it will also display intermediate check- 
sums every sixty-four bytes. This is pri- 
marily useful when someone is typing 
hexadecimal data or programs Into a 
computer. It verifies that the person has 
typed all of the information accurately. 
There is, however, one catch. Both the 
writer and the typist must use equiva- 
lent checksum programs, otherwise the 
checksums will not match. 

I am suggesting that you should pub- 
lish this program (or one like it) , and use 



JULY 1982

it to calculate checksums for all of the 
hexadecimal information appearing in 
Softalk. It will definitely save many 
hours of debugging, comparing semi sen- 
sical numbers. Some features of this par- 
ticular program are simplicity, fast exe- 
cution speed, and portability. I have test- 
ed it in both Integer and Applesoft Ba- 
sics, and I think it will also work in Mi- 
crosoft Basic-80. 

There is one thing about Softalk that I 
would like to see changed. Would you 
please stop typesetting the program list- 
ings? It might make the program list- 
ings more accurate, but the uniform 
spacing will definitely make them easier 
to understand.

Conditional Surrender 

I have decided that the benefits of sub- 
scribing to Softalk far outweigh the dis- 
advantages of not subscribing. There- 
fore, I am sending you a two-year sub- 
scription order, but I feel there are some 
problems that exist with your publica- 
tion that need to be addressed. 

First, there is the flimsy cover, and 
next, the lack of a reader service card. 
Also there is a lack of editorial response 
within Open Discussion. It's bad enough 
that there is an apparent three-month lag 
between a letter being written and its ap- 
pearance in the magazine. Then to ex- 
pect only readership response to such 
questions coming in later adds up to a six 
month delay. 

Finally, the blackest mark against 



your magazine is the presence of sex- 
ually oriented ads. Other magazines that 
I subscribe to don't carry this kind of ad- 
vertising, and it is a mystery to me why 
you feel you have to. It's one thing to ac- 
cept distasteful material into one's home 
alongside the good because it comes free, 
and quite another to endorse such mate- 
rial with a paid subscription. Please take 
my two-year renewal as a way of indi- 
cating to you that you don't need this ma- 
terial. 

Now that people like me will be in- 
creasing your revenue, you should be 
willing to settle this question once and for 
all. You can't be that hard up for money. 
George Wruck, Jr., Dallas, TX 

Cleans and Dirties 

I am fourteen years old and enjoy read- 
ing Softalk's Open Discussion each 
month, but it seems to me that in each is- 
sue the letters about the advertisements 
get longer and longer. I think that all a 
magazine should do is screen out the por- 
nographic ads. It should not be respon- 
sible for screening an ad because it dis- 
pleases a certain group. 

If the reader does not agree with an 
advertisement then the reader should not 
complain to the magazine, he should 
complain to the company that sponsors 
the advertisement. Why don't the 
readers stop picking on Softalk when it is 
not doing anything wrong?

JULY 1982 



SOFTAI 1^ 



This month we're going to tackle the subject of binary files 
and discuss ways of manipulating them with DOS commands. 
We'll also write a couple of handy exec utilities that will per- 
form some useful tricks for us. If all goes well, we'll both learn 
something along the way. 

What Is a Binary File? A binary file is simply a series of 
values ranging from 0 to 255 and stored in consecutive locations 
in your Apple's memory or on disk. It's that simple. Here's a 
sample binary file. 

194 197 193 199 204 69 160 194 210 207 83 

These numbers can represent whatever some programmer 
wants them to represent: numbers, letters, machine language 
commands, hi-res screen values, or whatever. Any number of 
values can be stored in a binary file, up to the limits of your Ap- 
ple's memory. You'll recognize a binary file in a catalog by the 
letter B to the left of the file's sector (size) number. 

When you encounter a binary file, it's probably one of three 
things : a series of values to be bloaded and used as some kind 
of data by a Basic program; a machine language program 
meant to be brun in which each number is part of a machine 
language command or statement ; a visual image meant to be 
bloaded. A number could represent a text screen character or 
lo-res color plot, or it could light up a set of dots on the hi-res 
screen. DOS lets you handle binary files with its brun, bload, 
and bsave commands. Here's a rundown of each command. 

Brun (usually pronounced "bee run") : The brun command 
is used to load and then run a machine language program. It is 
parallel to DOS's run command, which is a combination of 
DOS's load and Applesoft's run. Brun is instead a combination 
of DOS's bload and Applesoft's call commands. If you know the 
address in memory where a machine language program starts 
and that program is in memory, you can call that number to 
execute the program. For example, the FID program on the 
System Master disk is a machine language program. To use it, 
you normally type brun if/D (return). You could instead type 
bload FID and then call 2052. After quitting FID, you can call 
2052 to restart it, meaning go to location 2052 ($803) and exe- 
cute what's there. If no program is there, or if you call the 
wrong number, the call will crash into the Monitor (see com- 
mand notes box). 

Bload (say "bee load") : The bload command Is used to 
load any kind of binary file from disk into your Apple's memo- 
ry. Some binary files, like hi-res pictures, are meant cmly to be 
bloaded; they are never (and could not possibly be) brun. To 
specify where in memory a file is to be bloaded, type ",A" 
plus the starting location after the file name. Here's an 
example. 

HGR (return) 

BLOAD IMAGE, A8192 (return) 

The commands just listed will clear the hi-res screen (loca- 
tions 8192-16383) to black and load the binary file named 
Image (ideally, but not necessarily, a hi-res picture) into 
memory, starting at location 8192 (hex $2000, see box) and con- 
tinuing, byte-by-byte, until the entire file is in memory. If the 
binary file you bload is a hi-res picture, you'll actually see the 



screen light up in Venetian blind fashion. If you bload any 
other kind of binary file, you will get a random-looking snowy 
screen. If you had not specified the start location and typed 
only bload image (return) , the file would have loaded to the lo- 
cation from which it was bsaved. 

Bsave (say "bee save") : You can specify almost any sec- 
tion of memory and store it on a disk — a Basic program, a ma- 
chine language program, a lo-res or hi-res picture, or simply a 
string of numbers. You just need to tell the Apple where the 
section of memory starts and how long it is. 

Note: Both Applesoft's save command (for cassette use) 
and DOS's save command followed by a file name automati- 
cally know the location and length of the file being saved. Save 
is used only for storing Applesoft or Integer programs; spe- 
cifically, whatever program happens to be in memory when 
the command is executed. A program includes the com- 
mands, print statements, and remarks in that program, as 
well as line numbers and line locations. 

To bsave a straight chunk of memory — specifically the 
values of consecutive bytes of memory — you need to specify the 
starting address, A, and the length, L, of the range of memory 
you want to save. Here are some typical bsaves. 



BSAVE NAME, A8192, L8192 

or BSAVE NAME, A$2000, L$2000 
BSAVE NAME, A 16384, L8192 

or BSAVE NAME, A$4000, L$2000

Moving Memory Via DOS. Programmers often want to 
move memory; that is, to move the contents of a certain sec- 
tion of memory from one location to another. For example, you 
might have a hi-res picture stored on page two that you want to 
move to page one. Let's try it; run this little progfram first to 
set up both hi-res screens: 

10 HOME: HCOLOR=3: HGR: REM CLEAR HI-RES PAGE ONE 

20 FOR X=0 TO 279 STEP 20: HPLOT X,0 TO X, 191: NEXT 

30 FOR Y = 0 TO 191 STEP 20: HPLOT 0,Y TO 279,Y: NEXT 

40 HGR2: REM CLEAR HI-RES PAGE TWO 

50 FOR X = 0 TO 260 STEP 20: FOR Y = 0 TO 180 STEP 20 

60 HPLOT X,Y TO X-|-4,Y TO X-|-4,Y-(-4 TO X,Y-l-4 TO X,Y: NEXT: NEXT 

70 POKE 49236,0: REM VIEW PAGE ONE 

80 POKE 49235,0: VTAB 20: END: REM MAKE CURSOR VISIBLE 

After you run the program and save it, bsave your two works 
of art on disk with the following direct commands (no line 
numbers) : 

BSAVE PAGE 1 GRID, A$2000, L$2000 (return) 
BSAVE PAGE 2 SQUARES, A$4000, L$2000 (return) 

You will see these two b files in your catalog. Hi-res pic- 
tures are almost always thirty-four sectors in size. You may 
bload either picture onto either hi-res page by specifying the 
start location after the bload command. A$2000 (or A8192) 
means page one, and A$4000 {or A 1638U) means page two. For 
example, this command will load our squares pattern (which 
was bsaved from page two) onto page one: 



28 



# SOr TAI g- 



JULY 1982 



BLOAD PAGE 2 SQUARES, A$2000 (return) 

And while you're sitting there, you might as well try bloading a 
picture "between pages" (not too practical, but Interesting) : 

BLOAD PAGE 1 GRID, A$3000 

As you can see, bsave and bload may be used to (slowly) 
move memory via disk. Just bsave a section of memory to 
disk, then bload It back into memory exactly where you 
want it. 

Now type run (return) to redraw the two pictures. You 
should be looking at a grid pattern on page one. Notice that it is 
much faster to plot these two pictures than it is to bload them. 
Not only that, but Applesoft commands we used to draw our 
two pictures probably occupy about 3 percent of the disk space 
taken up by bsaving. Of course, this all depends on the com- 
plexity of the pictures involved. 

Page two's squares pattern is in memory (and on disk) but 
is not currently visible. Two pokes can determine which page 
we are looking at: 

POKE 49237,0 (return) See page two 

POKE 49236,0 (return) See page one 

After you type the first poke, your typing will be invisible but 
still functional. Hit reset or type text (return) if you get lost. 
Now, suppose we actually want to move the page two image to 
page one. Bring page one's grid into view and try the following 
direct commands (no line numbers, just type and watch) : 

CALL — 1 5 1 (return) Gives you an asterisk pronnpt 

2000 < 4000. 6000M (return) Moves memory; duplicates page- 

two picture ($4000-$6000) on 
page one ($2000-$4000) 
(Control-C) (return) Returns you to Basic 

Pretty slick, huh? Since this is supposed to be a DOS col- 
umn, we'll resist the temptation to explain what goes on here. 
As an introduction to DOS's exec command, however, let's 
write a little utility that will automatically execute these three 
commands without leaving Basic. 

Exec Mover. Exec is a handy direct DOS command that 
works with text files (see last month's text file discussion). 
Exec takes whatever text is in the file (until a carriage return 
is encountered) and executes it as if it were being typed di-

DOS COMMAND NOTES 

Hex notation is optional with DOS commands. For ex- 
ample, instead of the command bload image, A8192, you 
could use the equivalent, bload image, A$2000. It was ex- 
tremely thoughtful of the Apple guys to include this fea- 
ture when they wrote DOS. Hmm, do you think the Apple 
would understand catalog, S$06, D$01 . . .? 

Monitor execution is permissible with immediate- 
mode DOS commands; handy if you're poking around in 
hex and want to catalog a disk, save your work, or what- 
ever. If you are in the Monitor (after a call -151), and 
you type a DOS command {catalog, for example) the 
command will execute as expected, and you will get a 
bonus— a string of five two-digit hex numbers (which we 
highly recommend ignoring). If you encounter a DOS 
error, you will automatically reenter Ba,slc and be pre- 
sented with the error message you deserve. 

Control-D, or CHR$(4), is usable with all DOS com- 
mands. For example, to bload a file from within a pro- 
gram, use: 

100 PRINT CHR$(4); "BLOAD FILENAME,A1234" 

The order of commands, semicolons, and quote marks 
can be tricky. To specify a file name with a string and a 
location with a variable, use something like: 

TOO NAME$="FILENAME": LOC=1234 

1 10 PRINT CHR$(4); "BLOAD "; NAMES; ",A"; LOC 

By the way, all of the semicolons in line 110 are optional. 



rectly from the keyboard. If some kind of legal command is 
read from the disk, the command is executed. If a program 
line is read, that line is added to the program in memory. If 
gibberish comes up, the gibberish will be "typed in" and you'll 
probably get a ? Syntax Error. 

The following program will write a memory-moving text 
file for us based on the previous lil-res experiment. Notice the 
three commands used in print statements in lines 40-60: 

10 D$ = CHR$(13)+CHR$(4) 

20 TEXT: HOME: PRINT D$;"MONICO" 

30 PRINT D$; "OPEN MOVE 2 TO 1": PRINT D$; "WRITE MOVE 2 TO 1" 

40 PRINT "CALL -151" 

50 PRINT "2000<4000.6000M" 

60 PRINT "": REM INVISIBLE CONTROL-C BETWEEN QUOTES 

70 PRINT D$;"CLOSE" 

Run this program. A text file called Move 2 to 1 will be written 
onto your disk. Now bload a picture onto hl-res page two, then 
watch page one while you type: 

EXEC MOVE 2 TO 1 (return) 

The Apple goes to our text file on the disk and dutifully exe- 
cutes the commands it finds there, moving page two's image to 
page one! 

What if we want to move memory in the other direction? 
We could make a second text file that moves memory from 
page one to page two (line 50 would have to be print 
"4000< 2000A000M") . That would work all right, but it would 
clutter up our catalog with another text file, and, besides, it 
doesn't teach us anything new. 

Instead, let's rewrite the program by adding some new 
commands. We'll number the commands in computer fash- 
ion, 0-5: 

10 D$ = CHR$(13) + CHR$(4): PRINT D$; "MONICO" 

20 PRINT D$,"OPEN SWITCH": PRINT D$;"WRITE SWITCH" 

30 PRINT "CALL - 151": REM COMMAND #0 

40 PRINT "2000<4000.6000M": REM COMMAND #^ 

50 PRINT "": REM COMMAND #2 (CONTROL-C BETWEEN QUOTES) 

60 PRINT "CALL -151": REM COMMAND #3 

70 PRINT "4000<2000.4000M": REM COMMAND §4 

80 PRINT "": REM COMMAND #5 (CONTROL-C BETWEEN QUOTES) 

90 PRINT D$;"CLOSE" 

Running this program writes the text file sivitch onto your 
disk. If you exec the text file by tjrping exec switch (return) , 
you will move hl-res page two to page one (thanks to the

2000<4000.6000M command). The Jt000<2000.U000M command 
(see line 70 above) Is executed also, but that essentially does 
nothing; it moves page one's image, now a duplicate of pag^ 
two, back to page two. 

The thing is, we can make exec start anywhere in a text file 
that we want. Notice the command numbers in the REM state- 
ments above. If we want, we can make our exec statement 
start executing with command number three by typing: 

EXEC SWITCH, R3 

The R stands for "relative position" or something like that. To 
prove that this works, put a hi-res picture on page one, type 
hgr2 (return), and then exec switch, R3 (return). Page one's 
image is cloned onto page two ! So we have a dual purpose exec 
file that works with two commands: 

EXEC SWITCH Moves hi-res page two to page one 
EXEC SWITCH, R3 Moves hi-res page one to page two 

Exec seems to be designed as a direct-execution command be- 
cause it behaves very strangely in Applesoft programs — un- 
less it is the last command in a program ; then it works fine. To 
move memory from the middle of a program, it is best to use a 
machine-language routine similar to the one built in at loca- 
tion 65068 ($FE2C) in the Apple. 

Double Cat. Here's another exec utility; this one will split 
your catalog into two columns by poking DOS's catalog rou- 
tine, cataloguing , and then repoking DOS with normal values. 
First, let's go over the DOS pokes: 



POKE 44578,234: POKE 44579,234: 

POKE 44580, 234 
POKE 44578,32: POKE 44579,47: 

POKE 44580,174 
POKE 44567,12 

POKE 44567,29 



Removes carriage returns 
after file names 

Normal values for these locations 
Shortens file names to 
thirteen characters 
Normal thirty characters 



Here's a text file writer that uses these pokes. Type it, save it 
(optional), and run it: 

10 D$=CHR$(13)+CHR$(4) 

20 PRINT D$; "OPEN CAT2": PRINT D$;"WRITE CAT2" 

30 PRINT "NOMONICO" 

40 PRINT "POKE 44578,234: POKE 44579,234: POKE 44580,234" 

50 PRINT "POKE 44567,12" 

60 PRINT "CATALOG": REM (NO CONTROL-D; SEE BOX) 

70 PRINT "POKE 44578,32: POKE 44579,47: POKE 44580,174" 

80 PRINT "POKE 44567,29" 

90 PRINT D$;"CLOSE" 

Now, typing exec cat2 (return) will catalog your disks in two 
columns ! File names are necessarily reduced to thirteen char- 
acters maximum length. This is not a printer utility, by the 
way, since it relies on the carriage returns supplied by Apple's 
text screen routines. 

See you next month with some more utilities. But first . . . 

DOS Mystery of the Month. Chris Volpe, Apple key bang- 
er from Trumbull, Connecticut, reports that the command 
catalog a produces aji Applesoft ? Syntax Elrror. So does cator 
logb and cataloga. Catalogd, however, reports Range Error, 
probably because Apple thinks you mean catalog drive zero. 
Cataloge and several other catalog/character combos pro- 
duce a Syntax Error (DOS error with no question mark) . The 
command catalogv really produces the unexpected: it 
catalogs ! 

Here's a list of the illegally extended catalog commands 
and the errors they produce. I don't have an explanation; in 
fact I don't even want an explanation. I just think it's 
interesting!

BY DAVID mwm 

The star Sirius is the brightest object In the heavens. More 
than three thousand years ago Egyptians and Babylonians 
built temples facing the place where Sirius appeared on the 
horizon. 

In the crazy world of software games, the name Sirius rep- 
resents a bright star in the form of a company: Sirius Soft- 
ware, a firm that considers itself the leader in entertainment 
software for the Apple. 

Sirius resides in Sacramento on the edge of a time warp. 
The day may come when it's proven that plajdng computer 
games causes cancer in rats. When that day comes, Sirius will 
throw in the towel and move on to the next thing humans find 
entertaining. 

But for now, cofounder and secretary-treasurer Terry 
Bradley puts it like this: "Our long term goal Is to produce the 
best recreational software with the given technology for as 
many forms and media as is economically possible." 

Top Dogs of the Star. Though Bradley's title is secretary- 
treasurer, he is on equal footing with Sirlus's president, Jerry 
Jewell. (One benefit for Bradley is that Jewell gets a lot more 
phone calls.) Jewell once worked for Bradley at Computer- 
land of Sacramento, but the pair formed Sirius Software 
together. 

Despite the hierarchy indicated by corporate titles, Brad- 
ley and Jewell act as codirectors and share the decision mak- 
ing. Bradley claims that they see eye to eye on almost every- 
thing through something akin to ESP. 

"Projecting what Jerry's answer might be to a particular 
question, I'd say my prediction is correct 95 percent of the time. 
Jerry and I come from completely different backgrounds and 
are ten years apart in age. "There's only three things we have 
in common: We've both been in military service, we both like 
our meat raw, and we have sympathetic views on the way to 
run Sirius." 

They may be in the business of providing sometimes silly 
software like the game Lemmings, but Jewell and Bradley 
take their firm seriously. Both have plenty of business experi- 
ence in their previous occupations: Bradley spent more than 
twenty years in the air force managing men and budgets ; Jew- 
ell was a special agent and account executive in the Insurance 
business. 

Jewell bought an Apple In 1979 and is a self-taught pro- 
grammer and coauthor of E-Z Draw. Jewell has since hung up 
his keyboard, though, because the time-consuming task of pro- 
gramming would interfere with his full-time job of managing 
Sirius Software. 

In the Tombs of Ancient Software. Unlike Stoneware, How- 
ard Software, Southwestern Data Systems, Synergistic Soft- 
ware, and others, there is no single great programmer behind 
the success of Sirius. At least not anymore. In the beginning it 
was a different story. 

When Sirius placed six programs on Sof talk's Top Thirty 
nearly a year ago, four of them — including third place Gorgon 
and seventh place Space Eggs— were authored by Nasir 
Gebelli. 

One of the popular programming names in early Apple- 
dom, Nasir was synonymous with Sirius for almost a year. For 
many months he was the company's only full-time program- 
mer, producing a series of hit games that earned a lot of 
money and a good reputation for Sirius. 

Though other good programmers were soon freelancing for 
Sirius, Nasir was the undisputed star. 

Just as that particular Softalk issue arrived in homes, Nasir 
left Sirius to start his own company, Gebelli Software. Jerry

JULY 1982 



Jewell says candidly that he's sorry Nasir left — from the dol- 
lar perspective. 

"Nasir is an excellent programming talent. He Just wasn't 
a team player." 

Like the North losing their best general, Robert E. Lee, Siri- 
us has missed Nasir, but they're still a winning team. With pro- 
gramming talents like Larry Miller and Mark Turmell to pick 
up the ball, Sirius has not suffered in either sales or reputation. 

"You can't survive in an Industry unless you're filling a 
hole in the market. You've got to provide something that the 
public needs," Bradley explains. 

What Say We Go Out and Stomp a Few? There are wants 
and there are needs. Food and shelter are needs. Games are 
wants, but sometimes they take on the status of a quasl-need. 
Bradley doesn't expect people to spend their last dollars on 
Sirius games— but when they're flush with cash, Bradley 
wants them to go straight to Sirius for their entertainment 
software. 

A lack of good entertainment software is what led Brad- 
ley and Jewell to start Sirius in May 1980. At first the pace was 
laid back and Sirius was not taken too seriously. 

"It was something to keep us off the streets and out of trou- 
ble," claims Bradley. "Even now we're just trying to get a rea- 
sonable return on our investment like any entrepreneur. We 
would like to see the business profitable after taxes. 

"We never started this to get rich. We're trying to earn an 
income so that when we wake up there's someplace to go." 

Bradley, a retired air force colonel, left active duty in 1979. 
During his twenty-one years of active duty, Bradley was an 
airlift director working with a budget of hundreds of millions 
of dollars. FVom this experience, Bradley feels he learned a 
great deal about management. 

Bradley stayed because he wasn't sure he could hold on to a 
civilian job. Rather than risk losing his retirement benefits, he 



stuck It out In the air force as long as he could. The day he had 
been dreading finally came, and Bradley was just another 

civilian. 

After retirement, Bradley started searching for something 
to do. He first looked at real estate investment and went so far 
as to get a California real estate license. But the life of a broker 
was not for him. 

He researched available franchises at the library, pur- 
suing a long existing dream of starting his own business. A 
small print shop seemed like a good prospect, requiring little 
risk and only a small investment. But, one day, Bradley saw a 
magazine ad for Computerland. Here was a truly fascinating 
prospect that led him to check out a local Byte Shop to find out 
what a computer store was all about. With the master's de- 
gree in management from Golden Gate University and his air 
force experience, Bradley confidently approached Computer- 
land with a proposal for opening a store in Sacramento. 

Computerland of Sacramento opened in late 1979, and Brad- 
ley hired Jerry Jewell, a veteran of Vietnam, the next spring 
as sales manager. About that time, Nasir came strolling Into 
the store with a program he had written. Bradley looked at it 
and said It was "okay." But when Nasir came back a few 
days later and said, "What do you think of it now?" Sirius Soft- 
ware was bom. 

And the Battle Has Just Begun. That first program, E-Z 
Draw, is still selling well. Nasir followed it quickly with Both 
Barrels, Cyber Strike, and Star Cruiser. 

Nasir programmed full-time, while Jewell and Bradley 
worked a regular day at Computerland and ran Sirius part- 
time — almost like a hobby. Despite the laid back approach, 
Sirius was off to a shoot-'em-up start, both barrels blazing. 

There Is one way to illustrate the immense popularity Nasir 
and Sirius had the first year. Space Eggs, one of only a hand- 
ful of programs to dethrone VisiCalc from its usual top spot,

Turn your Apple into the world's 
most versatile personal computer. 



The SoftCard™ Solution. SoftCard 
turns your Apple into two computers. 
A Z-80 and a 6502. By adding a Z-80 
microprocessor and CP/M to your 
Apple, SoftCard turns your Apple into 
a CP/M based machine. That means 
you can access the single largest body 
of microcomputer software in exist- 
ence. Two computers in one. And, the 
advantages of both. 

Plug and go. The SoftCard system 
starts with a Z-80 based circuit card. 
Just plug it into any slot (except 0) of 
your Apple. No modifications required. 
SoftCard supports most of your Apple 
peripherals, and, in 6502-mode, your 
Apple is still your Apple. 

CP/M for your Apple. You get CP/M 
on disk with the SoftCard package. It's 
a powerful and simple-to-use operating 
system. It supports more software 
than any other microcomputer operat- 
ing system. And that's the key to the 
versatility of the SoftCard/Apple. 



BASIC included. A powerful tool, 
BASIC-80 is included in the SoftCard 
package. Running under CP/M, ANSI 
Standard BASIC-80 is the most 
powerful microcomputer BASIC 
available. It includes extensive disk I/O 
statements, error trapping, integer 
variables, 16-digit precision, exten- 
sive EDIT commands and string func- 
tions, high and low-res Apple graphics, 
PRINT USING, CHAIN and COM- 
MON, plus many additional com- 
mands. And, it's a BASIC you can 
compile with Microsoft's BASIC 
Compiler 

More languages. With SoftCard and 
CP/M, you can add Microsoft's ANSI 
Standard COBOL, and FORTRAN, or 



Basic Compiler and Assembly Lan- 
guage Development System. All, more 
powerful tools for your Apple. 
Seeing is believing. See the SoftCard 
in operation at your Microsoft or Apple 
dealer. We think you'll agree that the 
SoftCard turns your Apple into the 
world's most versatile personal 
computer.

placed first on Softalk'a Top Thirty twice. Naslr's games con- 
tinually made it to the Top Thirty — and often remained there a 
long time (Gorgon placed twenty-first in June 1982). 

Sirius became so successful that Bradley sold the Comput- 
erland store in May 1981. Jewell left with him. Bradley and 
Jewell hadn't expected Sirius to get so big; they thought the 
only good money was in hardware. But it's difficult to look suc- 
cess in the eye and pretend it's not there. 

Jim Ackerman was hired in the spring of 1981 as an opera- 
tions and production assistant. The ex-sheriff has gone on to 
become head of the department and handles much of the com- 
pany's day-by-day routine. One of the first full-time Sirius em- 
ployees, Ackerman has now been joined by more than thirty 
others, including Atari and IBM groups. 

One or two of every ten games submitted to Sirius is given 
serious consideration. Sometimes a game meets SIrius's stand- 
ards 100 percent, like Tony and Benny Ngo's arcade game 
Bandits. If a game is only 70 percent, however, the author 
works with product manager Ernie Brock. 

A prolific programmer and the author of Pascal Graphics 
Editor, a rare nongame product from Sirius, Brock was work- 
ing a year ago at the Bank of America, designing Apple-based 
data-capture systems. 

Brock would periodically drop by the C!omputerland store 
when Jewell and Bradley were in residence. He showed them 
programs for publication, but this was before Sirius got seri- 
ous. Besides working with programmers, Brock says with 
good humor, he spends most of his time shuffling paper. 

What was originally just "something to do" is now what 
Bradley sometimes calls the "wall of software." When you go 
into a store, perhaps a third of a wall is taken up by Sirius Soft- 
ware ; in a year's time, Bradley would like to see that third be- 
come half. 

"We consider ourselves number one in the game market, 
and there is no number two. There's a big tie for third, but no 
number two." 

Releasing three to four games a month for the Apple, Siri- 
us is publishing at a torrid pace. There should be few argu- 
ments about whether they're indeed number one in volume. 
But volume publishing can have its drawbacks. With so many 
Sirius games coming out, retailers and customers begin to 
have problems distinguishing the products. 

Bradley claims that Sirius ships fifteen to twenty thousand 
pieces a month. Marketplace feedback indicates that for 
every competitor's game sold, Sirius sells two. 

"We're not blind, though," Bradley says. "We're not the 
only ones in this business, and we welcome the competition of 
On-Line, Broderbund, Gebelli, and Continental. 

"I must compliment Broderbund for the cuteness of 
Choplifter. It's a really superb program." 

One edge that Sirius hopes to maintain over the competi- 
tion is low prices. Jewell wants 90 percent of the product to sell 
for less than thirty dollars each — as the average market price 
for state-of-the-art games inches toward thirty-five dollars. 

The Game That Will Steal Your Bandits. Both Jewell and 
Bradley are angered by the rampant piracy that is, by 
Jewell's estimate, producing five illegal copies of every legal 
copy sold. He believes that high software prices are the result 
of revenue lost to piracy, and the added expense of protection. 

Bradley thinks many pirates have no idea how serious their 
crimes are. Many pirates are not legally adults. What they 
don't realize is that their parents could go to jail, not them, he 
says. 

"The majority of people pirating software are either juve- 
nile in age or mentality. It's the old adage of 'the right to make 
back-up copies of valuable software.' No way are games 
valuable software in this sense." 

Sirii.is's replacement policy is utterly fair. If you include the 
receipt with the bad disk, they'll provide a new copy free. If 
you don't have a receipt, the charge is five bucks with no ques- 
tions asked. 

Bradley cites a typical pirate tactic : breaking the protec- 
tion scheme, making one or more copies, fixing the game so it 




The Scott Adams Adventure series for the 
Apple II is now better than ever. The new 
Scott Adams Graphic Adventure series 
features voice, lowercase, and full color, 
I high resolution graphics. 

A jam-packed disk, with both sides 
used, contains the Adventure and the 
full color hi-res pictures which are 
stored using new, special state-of-the- 
art techniques. 

• Each screen was drawn using a 
palette of over 100 colors and tex- 
tures. Each work of art was designed 
and entered by a professional artist. 

- Both the VOTRAX Type-'N-Talktm 
voice synthesizer and lower case hard- 
ware are supported.

won't boot, and then trying to exchange It for a different game. 

The tools of piracy are readily available — and Bradley Is 
vehemently opposed to their sale. 

"I believe the people who market nibble copiers are crooks. 
In the law It's called contributory copyright infringement." 

Sony is currently involved in just such a case over Its video 
cassette recorders. Bradley is attentively watching that case 
develop. It could set a precedent for similar cases In the soft- 
ware industry. 

In the realm of possible infringement of arcade game copy- 
right, Sirius has had some experience. Nadir's Gorgon was a 
superior copy of Williams's popular arcade game Defender. At 
the time the law only prohibited the actual duplication of code. 

Since then the law has been expanded to include game 
graphics and sound effects. Sirius has acquired a license for 
Gorgon and now pays royalties to Williams. They also con- 
tinue to pay author's royalties to Nasir. 

Because of the double payment of royalties, Sirius is not 
terribly interested in copying arcade games. Not unless the au- 
thor of the computer version is willing to take a smaller cut. 

One problem a big company like Atari presents to small- 
er software publishers is its ability to pay money up-front to an 
arcade manufacturer for personal computer rights. With 
guaranteed sales to owners of Atari computers, half a million 
bucks for such rights is peanuts. 

Nonetheless, Bradley admires some of Atari's practices. 
Like the cowboy and disco crazes, Pac-Man fever was cre- 
ated. And, manufactured or not, the phenomenon helped put 
Atari's name in everybody's minds. What's admirable is how 
Atari used the success to promote the company. 

"Let's say you put out twenty games and you have one or 
two windfalls that sell a million copies," begins Bradley. "The 
first reaction is usually 'I'm set for life, time to invest or re- 
tire.' But this is shortsighted. If you have a real bam burner, 
then you should put the profits into more institutional advertis- 
ing. Blow the windfall money on getting your name out there 
and known. 

"The business will grow like a pyramid. The wider the 



base, the higher the top of the pyramid." 

Big pyramids tend to spawn little pyramids. Sirius owns an- 
other firm. River City Ads, which is about to benefit from a big 
contract between Sirius and Twentieth Century-Fox. Sirius 
will produce a new line of games for the Atari VCS, and 
Twentieth Century-Fox will handle marketing and manufac- 
turing. The games should start appearing this fall. 

Sirius now accounts for about 70 percent of River City's 
business, but next year it may be a different story. River City 
landed Twentieth Century- Fox as an advertising client for the 
new VCS games. 

What Has 48K and Is Addictive? With all this philosophy of 
business and marketing, what about the games themselves? 
Both Bradley and Jewell have definite ideas about what makes 
a good game. 

A typical game needs to be fun above all else. It must have 
some depth so that it is challengfing. Ideally, a game will be 
simple enough at the beginning for a klutz to enjoy but have 
enough challenge to please the erstwhile arcade expert. 

There is no point in having a game that is physically im- 
possible to play. If the creatures or what have you are moving 
too fast, either the controls are inadequate or the game re- 
quires superhuman coordination. 

Bradley believes that fantasy-type games are the way of 
the future. Sports games and board games are much more 
satisfying in their original forms ; they play better with the real 
props. You can't go out on the street and play Gorgon. 

Risk and the fantasy of danger are crucial to some games, 
even if it's mostly on a subconscious level. Pac-Man has these 
elements. Part of the game entails flirting with disaster, at- 
tempting to make best use of the energfy dots. Ultimately, the 
only harm you incur playing Pac-Man is losing a quarter. 

Encoioraging the player to be greedy and take risks is a de- 
sirable element in arcade games. So is a reward for good 
playing. 

"People want to score. But not a grand total of seven points. 
They want to score seven million. It's like working," explains

"Personal computers should be made as easily available to 
a child as pencils," observed Dr. Seymour Papert before a 
group of educators at the University of Dallas in November 
1981. "The pencil is used to scribble, to doodle, to draw, to 
write, to work sums, or to chew on. It is used for Illicit notes as 
well as for official assignments. I see the computer in the life of 
the child as equally ubiquitous and equally versatile. I also see 
it as equally personal. Children own pencils; they are not in- 
timidated by them. This should be equally true of the child's 
personal computer." 

Papert is one of the world's leading authorities on how chil- 
dren absorb knowledge and how best to develop their learning 
skills. He is also one of a large number of experts who recog- 
nize the enormous impact computer science is having on the 
educational process, both in the classroom and in the home. 
With his associates at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he spent twelve 
years developing a unique philosophy of education that has 
been implemented through the computer language called 
Logo. 

Tool or Threat? Today, even with computers already a per- 
vasive part of our everyday world, electronic technology is far 
less forbidding to the average child than to his parents, who 
are often bewildered by the onrushing progress of the technol- 
ogy. To the young person, the computer is nothing more or less 
than a fascinating tool. But his parents tend to blame an end- 
less variety of problems on the computer. 

When today's youngster reaches adulthood, his environ- 
ment will have been computerized to the degree that it will be 
totally accepted as the way the world is. For this reason, it is 
becoming increasingly important that a child's education in- 
corporate familiarity with, and understanding of, a technolo- 
gy that will be as much a part of his surroundings tomorrow as 
pencils and paper are today. 

Actually, computers have been around the classroom for 
more than twenty years, starting with rudimentary pro- 
grammed instruction in the late 1950s and progressing very 
slowly through the 1970s. Intel Corporation began the dramatic 
change with the introduction of the microprocessor in 1971. 
This led to the first microcomputer in 1975. It also brought ac- 
tive use of the computer to the classroom. 

The tjrpical use has been for the talented and gifted stu- 
dents to use preprogrammed software as drill and practice for 
math and other technical courses. However, a few innovative 
teachers have used computers to help the learning disabled 
and the so-called slow learners. Programs have been individ- 
ualized for the specific needs of each child so that each is con- 
tinually challenged and continues to move at her own pace. 
The child, in turn, develops a personal one-on-one relationship 
with the computer, receiving immediate feedback and rein- 
forcement. 

No-Fault Learning. More important, the child is not em- 
barrassed in front of friends or the teacher if a wrong answer is 
entered — he just tries again. As the child experiences immedi- 
ate success with a correct answer, he is encouraged to 
continue to learn, even to excel. Slow learners gain valuable 
self-confidence in their approach to problems. And brighter 
students become more creative because they use the comput- 
er to deal with interesting real-life situations where the num- 
bers can become quite cumbersome. They use it for every- 
thing from reliving the Civil War to simulating a flight in an 
aircraft or in a spaceship. 

But this type of experience can create problems. Rather 
than learn to use their innate creativity, the students must re- 
ly on the creativity of the programmer. The computer be- 
comes little more than an intelligent video game. 

On the other hand, teaching youngsters to program can be 
equally cumbersome. Words such as init, CHR$, MID$, ABS, 
gosub, and Syntax Error are not part of a typical child's 
vocabulary. Coupled with the complexities of operating such 
high-level languages, young people tend to find it extremely 
difficult to explore the potential of the computer. 

With the introduction of Logo, however, the student is able 



to become immediately involved in a unique, computer-based 
learning environment where mathematics, language arts, 
logic, and other areas of traditional learning can be absorbed 
in an instinctive, natural fashion, much as a child learns to 
speak, to walk, or to experience the wonders of a butterfly — or 
a turtle. 

Logo, however, is far more than just a learning language. It 
can serve the needs of all ages and experience. It is much like 
the game of chess. A six- year-old can learn the basic moves of 
chess, but elderly masters still seek to learn more about the 
game. Like Logo, it appears to offer infinite expandability. 

Graphic Pet. Young people are introduced to Logo through 
turtle graphics. Where once the turtle roamed the floor as an 
electromechanical device controlled by a large computer, now 
the Logo turtle is a cybernetic pet that resides on the comput- 
er screen. Rather than draw pictures on paper spread out on 
the floor, the turtle is now a small triangle, ready to move and 
draw at the command of the user. 

Using very simple primitive commands, even preschool- 
ers learn to control the turtle, moving it forward, back, left, or 
right. They also find that they can have penup, pendown, pen- 
erase, and penreverse. Drawing a simple house quickly be- 
comes a sequence of "turtle steps." 

FORWARD 50 

RIGHT 90

RIGHT 90

This creates the frame of the house in the form of a square. 
Now we'll put a triangle on top of the house to create a roof. 

FORWARD 50 

RIGHT 120 \~ 
FORWARD 50 

RIGHT 120 ^> 
FORWARD 50 

RIGHT 120 

The only problem with this procedure is that the roof ap- 
pears inside the house. But this is not necessarily wrong — it is 
merely a bug that has to be corrected. 

Let's take another look at the problem. And let's also sim- 
plify the program entry. 



REPEAT 4 [FD 50 RT 90] 
FD 50 
RT 30 

REPEAT 3 [FD 50 RT 120] 




Now the triangle is properly positioned on top of the square 
to present a rudimentary picture of a house. 

Follows Orders. Having drawn the house, we can now 
"teach" the computer to draw any number of houses by defin- 
ing a new Logo command. House. 

TO HOUSE

FD 50 RT 30 

REPEAT 3 [FD 50 RT 120] 
END 

By entering the new command. House, the triangle is drawn on 
top of the square. 

However, this is only the beginning of the power of Logo.

here is recursion, the use of a problem, or procedure, to call it-

One of the Apple II's most powerful features is its capacity 
for expansion via the eight peripheral connector slots on the 
motherboard. In particular, the ROM expansion technique in- 
corpKjrated into the Apple allows any peripheral card to take 
over various portions of the ClOO-CFFF address space. This 
makes it possible to give intelligence to add-on devices by way 
of software residing in PROM (programmable read only 
memory) . Most peripheral cards make use of this feature. 

To take advantage of this feature and try out your own ciis- 
tom designs, you need a way to program PROMS. EPROMs, 
chips containing erasable programmable read only memory in 
IK and 2K versions, are ideal for experimental use. 

EPROMs are also used for character generators, control- 
lers, advanced logic for printers, and other sophisticated elec- 
tronic applications. Having access to an EPROM program- 
mer allows you to alter the operation of such devices to suit 
your needs. You might add descenders to the character-gen- 
erating EPROM on a lower-case adapter. Or you could change 
the program in your printer so that it defaults to different con- 
ditions. It's also possible to put useful routines in the unused 
ROM sockets in the Apple or on a ROM board, from which 
they'd be available without having to load them from disk. 
In fact, it's even possible to replace the entire ROM on the 
motherboard or on a ROM card so that the Apple becomes a 
dedicated turnkey computer, performing your application as 
soon as it's turned on. EPROMs can be very useful indeed. 

What Are EPROMs? Erasable programmable read only 
memory — what does it all mean? Well, first of all, we're talk- 
ing about an integrated circuit, or chip, which is merely a col- 
lection of electronic components — transistors, resistors, ca- 
pacitors, and so on — all connected in a particular fashion to 
perform a desired function. In the case of a 2K PROM, more 
than sixteen thousand transistors populate that little black box. 
Like all DIP (dual in-line package) ICs, a 2K PROM has two 
rows of connecting pins that exit from the chip so that it can be 
wired to other components to make a complete system. 

A memory chip differs from other ICs such as CPUs or ad- 
dress decoders in that it usually consists of a large array of 
memory cells. Each memory cell represents one bit of data; 
therefore, any device that can be in one of two states can func- 
tion as a memory cell. As an example of a simple memory ele- 
ment, consider the power switch on your computer. When you 
flip this switch up, the computer turns on and then stays on 
even after your hand moves away from the switch, Thus, the 
switch remembers that you have turned it on. It will stay in 
this state until you push the switch down to turn it off. By con- 
trast, a doorbell uses a momentary switch that turns on only as 
long as you hold it down with your finger. When you let go, the 
switch turns off; this kind of switch has no memory. 

Transistors make very good switches ; therefore most semi- 
conductor memory chips use them for the storage elements. 
The controlling portion of a transistor is known as the ba^e (or 
gate) and it is the presence or absence of an electric charge or 
voltage at this base that determines if a transistor will be on or 
off. Memory chips typically lay out a large array of transis- 
tors that can be reached via a binary address. With just ten 
leads to the outside world, for example, we have the capability 
to select one out of 1,024 possible memory elements. Some 
memory chips are organized to communicate with eight bits at 
a time. Such chips are referred to as byte-wide memories. 



Once the desired memory element location has been se- 
lected, data can be read from (or written to in the case of ran- 
dom access memory) the cell by the computer. With read only 
memory, only preprogrammed data can be read out by the 
computer. Contrary to their name, most ROMs are also ran- 
dom access. This just means that any memory cell can be 
called directly. The alternative is serial access, such as exists 
in bubble memories, where data must be read in order. 

Contact! There are many ways to control which of the tran- 
sistors in the entire memory array will represent ones and 
zeros. For example, at each memory location where we want 
logical "one" data, we can connect the base of the transistor to 
the positive voltage supply; where we want a "zero," we 
can leave the base unconnected. Thus, a very intricate pattern 
of connecting wires must be formed as part of the manufac- 
turing process for making the chip. Such a device is known as a 
mask programmable read only memory or, just simply, a 
ROM. The chips that store the Integer and Applesoft interpre- 
ters are of this type. ROMs are inexpensive to make, but since 
they require a special custom design when manufactured, a 
large one-time "mask fee" is usually charged. Therefore, 
ROMs become cost-effective only when large numbers (thou- 
sands) are needed. Since a new mask fee must be paid if the 
ROM pattern is changed, it is also imperative that the code be- 
ing placed in ROM is bugfree and unlikely to be changed. 

For smaller applications, there is the programmable ROM, 
or PROM. This device is manufactvired with all memory cells 
wired to represent the same state. Individual cells can then be 
programmed into the other state. PROMs are not as simple to 
program as RAM; you need special apparatus. 

The most common form of PROM is the fusable-link va- 
riety. This device uses a very fine wire at each memory cell. 
Each wire can be individually burnt away (now you know why 
we call this "burning a PROM") to program the state of that 
cell. Thus, you can create any desired pattern of ones and 
zeros within the PROM to represent your data. If you make a 
mistake, you'll probably have to throw the PROM away; once 
a fuse is burnt it can't be repaired. 

The most interesting type of PROM by far is the erasable 
PROM, or EPROM. Besides being programmable, this device 
can also be erased and used over again. Erasure is accom- 
plished by exposing the chip to a strong ultraviolet light for 
twenty to thirty minutes. This is the reason these chips have a 
clear window on top. (It's not just to let you see what the actual 
chip looks like, although it's quite fascinating to look inside; 
you may gain a finer appreciation for what really goes into a 
computer.) Obviously, when you erase an EPROM, all the 
cells get erased simultaneously. 

Tech Talk. An EPROM works by isolating the gate of each 
memory transistor; that is, there is no direct electrical con- 
nection to the gates. Under these conditions, the output of each 
cell will be at logic high, or at the byte level $FF. Zeros are pro- 
grammed into the EPROM cells by placing a small static 
charge near the gate regions. The programmer accomplishes 
this by using a relatively high voltage (about 25V). This 
charge remains in the selected gate region, causing that tran- 
sistor to change states. Since the gate is isolated from the rest 
of the device, there is no way for this charge to leak off. There- 
fore, the EPROM will remain programmed for at least ten 
years (there is a very small leakage rate that will erase the

EPROM eventually) . 

When the EPROM is exposed to ultraviolet light, energy ab- 
sorbed from the light causes these charges to be neutralized. 
Thus, the EPROM reverts back to its all $FF state and can 
then be reprogrammed. Because of the EPROM's susceptibil- 
ity to ultraviolet light, most people cover its window with 
opaque labels after having programmed it. This is just a pre- 
cautionary measure — even if you were to leave an EPROM out 
in direct sunlight, it would take several weeks to erase it. 

The basic differences among EPROMs have to do with 
their storage densities (how many bit cells per chip) and with 
the supply voltages required. Earlier EPROMs operated on 
three separate power supplies: +12V, +5V, and -5V. Most 
EPROMs today use only the +5V supply. However, since 
many devices, including peripherals for the Apple, were de- 
signed with the older EPROMs, it is important to recognize dif- 
ferences among EPROMs, especially the differences in the 
ways they are programmed. 

Usually you can tell what a chip is by its part number. The 
most popular EPROMs are the 27XX and 25XX series devices 
(XX represents the number of kilobits of storage) . These de- 
vices are all byte-wide, so a 2716 can store 2K of data. 

One of the reasons we have both 27XX and 25XX series goes 
back to the early days when the single-supply EPROMs were 
just coming out. Two IC manufacturers claimed the same part 
number for each of their very different EPROMs. Texas In- 
struments had been manufacturing triple power supply 
EPROMs such as the 2708; their new EPROM with twice the 
capacity was called, logically, the 2716. Intel, however, had a 
better part that was also a 2K EPROM but used only one sup- 
ply. They chose to call their part a 2716 also. Thus, it became 
confusing to talk about 2716S without knowing whose chip you 
were referring to. 

While many other manufacturers make EPROMs, for the 
purpose of this discussion we will refer to the Texas Instru- 
ments and Intel 2716. Since the single-supply EPROMs are 
easier to use, even Texas Instruments offered them eventual- 



j-rrm 49 

ly ; thus, the 25XX series. The current state-of-the-art is single- 
supply EPROMs, including the 2716, 2732, and 2764 (2K, 4K, 
and 8K respectively). You may still come across tri-voltage 
2708s or 2716s, though. Let's take a look at some of the EPROM 
programmers available for the Apple II. 

Microproducts EPROM Programmer. The Microproducts 
programmer has been around for several years ; it was prob- 
ably the first EPROM programmer designed specifically for 
the Apple II. It features a Textool zero insertion force socket 
for the EPROM and a programming power switch. The ZIF 
socket makes it easy to insert and remove EPROMs without 
bending or fiddling with the IC pins. This board is designed to 
program +5 volt EPROMs only but can be modified easily to 
work with multi voltage PROMs also. 

The only software included in the Microproducts EPROM 
programmer comes in the form of an EPROM Mover pro- 
gram. This program transfers any given block of data (usual- 
ly from RAM) into the PROM. The programmer can also be 
used with the company's assemblers to bum progn^ams direct- 
ly from source code. This is accomplished by having the blank 
EPROM appear to occupy the address range it will actually 
occupy when it is used. For example, if you're going to bum a 
PROM that's meant to replace the F800-FFFF Monitor ROM, 
the programmer board should be strapped to the F8 position. A 
small jumper wire is provided for this purpose, along with sev- 
eral socket pins into which the wire is placed. These pins are 
provided only for the DO and D8 blocks, however; you must 
supply your own to configure the board for any others. The rea- 
soning behind this goes back to the days of Integer-only Apple 
lis in which DO and D8 sockets on the motherboard were emp- 
ty. This programmer was often used to bum EPROMs for 
those sockets. However, those sockets are designed to accept 
ROMs, not EPROMs. There's a slight difference between 
ROM sockets and EPROM sockets, but Microproducts also 
sells an EPROM adapter socket that makes the EPROM com- 
patible with a socket meant for ROM. 

While the addressing scheme just described can be useful

for assembling code directly into ROM, it is usually unneces- 
sary. If you already have a complete binary image of the 
PROM somewhere in RAM, the Mover program can transfer 
the data to whichever block the board is configured for. This bi- 
nary image can be gotten from a variety of sources such as 
reading an existing ROM or from an assembler using the OBJ 
directive to place the object code in RAM. 

Using the programmer with the Mover is quite simple. The 
program asks for the starting and ending addresses for the 
block of data to be moved into the ROM. Then it asks for the 
destination address, which will usually be the default block for 
the board or DOOO (this does not imply that the code being 
moved must actually run at this address). After confirming 
that the information was entered correctly, the EPROM is 
burned. This takes several minutes, after which the computer 
is turned off and the EPROM removed. 

While this programmer works very well and can be modi- 
fied for multiPROM use, no provisions are made for reading 
the PROM while it is in the programmer. Also, some people 
may find it an inconvenience that the Apple must be turned off 
when installing and removing EPROMs. Of course, even these 
shortcomings can be solved with a few more modifications. 

All in ali, this is a fairly good unit for the price. The Micro- 
products EPROM Programmer sells for $99.95. The EPROM 
socket adapters are $9.95 each. 

Mountain Computer ROMWrlter. The ROMWriter has 
many features including a ZIF socket, a write-protect switch, 
and a PROM power switch. This last switch allows EPROMs 
to be inserted or removed even while the computer is on. The 
PROMs can also be read from this board, making It possible 
for you to verify that the PROM is erased prior to progfram- 
ming. It also allows the programming software to verify that 
the burn is successful by comparing the contents of the PROM, 
after burning, with the original data. Only single supply 2716s 
can be programmed. 

The ROMWriter places the EPROM in the $C800-$CFFF 
address space of the Apple. For this reason, there is also an- 
other switch labeled CFFF OFF. The purpose of this switch 
lies in the Apple I/O protocol with regard to I/O ROM expan- 
sion. This protocol requires that all peripheral boards turn off 
(that is, relinquish the C800-CFFE common I/O space) 
whenever the address CFFF is accessed. This could pose a 
problem if you wished to read or program the last byte of a 
PROM on the ROMWriter. Thus, a switch was added to defeat 
the shutdown of the ROMWriter after accessing CFFF. 

EPROM programming is fairly simple with the software 
supplied, and the pretest for blank and verification add a bit of 
reliability to the procedure. The Mountain Computer 
ROMWriter sells for $175. 

Word Power PROM Programmer. Here's a newcomer in 
the field with a low-cost, easy-to-use programmer for -I-5V 
2716s. To keep costs down, a regular IC socket is used for the 
EPROM instead of a ZIF type, but there's a special area on the 
board on which you can install your own ZIF socket. 

The programmer must be installed in slot 3 and the Apple 
should be off when changing EPROMs. The software included 
allows EPROM erasure verification, single-step read or write, 
or entire block read or write of the PROM. All block writes are 
verified after programming is complete. 

Aside from a few bugs in the demonstration software (typi- 
cal of a first release on a new product), the unit performed 
well. There's some confusion as to what area of RAM gets 
burned into the EPROM. In each of the examples, the starting 
address of $2000 is used, but when we tried to bum our first 
EPROM by loading the object data into this area, it didn't 
work. We then had to list their Applesoft prog^ram to discover 
that the real buffer starts at $4800. 

ROM Boards. As previously mentioned, there are lots of 
reasons for programming EPROMs. If you're going to use the 
EPROM in some other piece of equipment or if you're just 
modifying the information on an existing device, the new 
EPROM already has a place to go. If the EPROM contains 
some program that you want the Apple II to execute, it must be 



plugged into the motherboard or into a socket on a ROM card. 
When using an EPROM in place of a ROM, on the mother- 
board or an Integer/ Applesoft ROM card, don't forget to use 
an adapter socket like the ZIF from Mlcroproducts. Other 
boards are designed to accept EPROMs directly. 

ROMPlus. A complete description of this board was given in 
the August 1981 issue of Softalk. Basically, this board allows up 
to six EPROMs to be used, via bank switching into the C800- 
CFFF space. A control PROM on the board simplifies inter- 
facing your programs and allows you to run them with just a 
few keystrokes. With the appropriate software, one PROM can 
call another on this board, making it possible to put programs 
longer than 2K into EPROM. 

Mlcroproducts ROM Memory Module. This board acts like 
the Integer/ Applesoft ROM card in that it replaces up to 12K of 
the motherboard's ROM space (DOOO-FFFF) with ROM soft- 
ware on the board. A switch provides selection between Apple- 
type ROMs or +5 volt 2716s. Another bank of DIP switches se- 
lects which of the six ROM sockets will be active when the 
board is called. As with Apple's ROM boards, you can also 
choose whether the board is selected upon power-ups. 

One purpose for a board like this is to replace the Apple's 
native Basic with a specialized language, an operating sys- 
tem, or even a dedicated application program. For example, 
the Mlcroproducts 6502 Development System is available in 
EPROM. This system brings together their assembler, disas- 
sembler, and debugger programs into a consolidated package 
that can be up and running as soon as the computer is turned 
on. Thus, you can turn the Apple into a dedicated operating tool 
and still use it as a, computer when you want to. 

The ROM Memory Module from Mlcroproducts sells for 
$99.95. With the Development System EPROMs installed, the 
price is $249.95. 

Soft CTRL Systems ROM Board System. Soft CTRL Sys- 
tems made several EPROMs in the past that were designed to 
work in a ROMPlus. In an attempt to broaden their market, 
they have now released an inexpensive single ROM board of 
their own. Thus, you can take any one of their'ROMs and in- 
sert it into this board for Instant use by the computer. The 
main advantage to this board is its low price — $29.95. 

Finally . . . There are several other EPROM progfram- 
mers available for the Apple, including one made by Apparat 
that has personality modules; unfortunately, it was unavail- 
able for review. Dedicated stand-alone programmers are quite 
expensive but can sometimes program sixteen EPROMs at 
once for production use. As the 2732 and 2764 become more pop- 
ular, we should see low-cost programmers for them, too. 

On a different front, there is a lot of competition for the 
EPROM from such other devices as the EAROM (electrically 
alterable ROM) and EEPROM (electrically erasable PROM) . 
As their names imply, these devices can be programmed while 
in the computer. In addition, they can be selectively erased 
and rewritten, making them the almost perfect memory de- 
vice. Although these devices currently suffer from several 
drawbacks, they are a good choice for a read-mostly memory 
where nonvolatile storage is needed. 

Finally, here are a few tips on handling EPROMs: (1) 
Cover the window with opaque tape or a label when not eras- 
ing. (2) When you want to erase an EPROM, make sure the 
quartz lid is very clean ; a small speck of dirt or g^m from a 
previous label can shadow some of the cells, preventing their 
erasure. (3) . Do not overerase. Most ultraviolet PROM erasers 
take 15 to 25 minutes to erase a PROM. (4) Texas Instruments 
chips should always be completely programmed. If you need 
only a portion of the memory space, fill the rest of the EPROM 
with $FFs (the EPROM's natural state) . When adding to a pre- 
viously programmed EPROM, run through the entire address 
space rewriting the old data. JM

The Schoolhouse Apple 

' by Jean Varven 




Take a moment to think back to your early elementary- 
school years. What sights, sounds, and experiences come to 
mind? Do you remember running your first relay race and 
how your throat felt after you'd cheered your teammates 
along? How about the taste and texture of the peanut butter 
cookies you used to get in the school cafeteria? Or how your 
Halloween black-cat cutout looked pasted down on pumpkin- 
colored construction paper and displayed on the bulletin 
board? 

Some people consider this kind of reminiscence a waste of 
time in education, especially when there's so much to teach, so 
much to learn. But it can be argued otherwise. If we are in- 
volved in education, computer-assisted or not, one of the most 
important things we can bring to it is our awareness of the 
sights, sounds, and textures that make lasting impressions 
on us. 

Thus, when we attempt to evaluate what educational aids 
best meet our own needs, those of our students, and those of our 
children, we can bring to the process a unique expertise bred 
from our own past experiences. If a program appeals to us, it 
may well be that the people who created it took a few extra 
minutes to think back on some vivid experiences and impres- 
sions of their own. 

More Capsules. Picking up from where we left off in May, 
here's the next batch of company capsules. Perhaps you'll 
meet someone who's created just the program you're look- 
ing for.

Avant-Garde Creations, Box 30161, Eugene, OR 97403; (503) 
345-3043. Contact: Mary Carol Smith. 

Established in December 1979, Avant-Garde entered the 
education market the following spring with Sentence Dia- 
gramming. Chief programmer Don Jones, one of Avant- 
Garde 's cofounders, created the program after the company 
discovered that a number of educators wanted to teach lan- 
guage skills through sentence diagramming and were unable 
to find a suitable program for doing so. Among Avant-Garde's 
other products are the AEN Grading System package and 
Word Scrambler and Super Speller, a spelling program some 
learners find as entertaining and challenging as a video game. 

Avant-Garde also produces ZES, a courseware system de- 
veloped in Australia that allows users to create their own edu- 
cational courseware without a background in programming. 
In addition, the company is eager to make available a pool of 
classroom courseware generated through the ZES project. 

Company cofounder Mary Carol Smith, who describes the 
education market as "the most challenging," believes that mi- 
crocomputers have the potential to transform education. The 
computer, says Smith, helps students become more responsi- 
ble for their own learning, and, as a consequence, both the edu- 
cational setting and the role of the teacher will change. 

Edutek Corporation, 415 Cambridge, #14, Box 11354, Palo Alto, 
CA 94306; (415) 325-9965. Contact: Keisha Williams, Aretha 
Lawrence. 

Edutek qualifies as an old-timer in the educational soft- 
ware field, having produced software for use in preschools, 
schools, community organizations, and homes since 1978. 
Their hand-eye coordination package includes Cooperation 
Maze, a program in which two players work together to move 
the cursor through a maze ; Write It in Color, an introduction to 
the Apple keyboard; Make a Tune; and Computer Palette, 
which enables users to create and save their own paintings. 
(Each of these programs is also available individually.) In ad- 
dition, the company offers programs in music theory, math, 
and language skills. 

Another product that's likely to interest educators is Poly- 
Choice, a program that enables teachers with no program- 
ming knowledge to create multiple-choice activities in science, 
social studies, math, language, and so on. 

Besides producing software, Edutek offers programming 
and consulting services. 

Hartley Courseware, Box 431, Dimondale, MI 48821; (616) 942- 
8987. Contact: Tim Hartley. 

Jane Hartley, a veteran elementary school teacher, and 
Tim Hartley, an air traffic controller turned programmer, 
formed their own educational software company in 1979. Since 
then, this mother-son team has been busy creating and mar- 
keting educational software for K-10 students in reading, lan- 
guage arts, and mathematics. In addition, they offer a series of 
Create Your Own disks that enable teachers and parents with 
no programming knowledge to create lessons in reading and 
math. Their most recent release is Capitalization, a menu- 
driven program that presents the rules of capitalization and 
gives students the opportunity to apply what they have learned 
to practice sentences. 

All Hartley Courseware programs, including the Create 
Your Own disks, feature "student planning." This manage- 
ment plan provides a teacher with accurate records of stu-

IdeaTech Company, Box 62451, Sunnyvale, CA 94088; (408) 
985-7591. Contact: Ron Eckert. 

Ron Eckert and his wife Sue formed IdeaTech two and one- 
half years ago to create and market educational software to 
serve the needs of learning-disabled and mentally handi- 
capped students. As is often the case with smaller companies, 
one of IdeaTech's goals has been to create software in areas 
that not many people have addressed before. Their program 
Basic Electricity , on the market for about a year and a half, 
provides a good example of this philosophy in action. Another 
program. Color Guess, teaches preschool through second- 
grade learners how to recognize and spell color words by asso- 
ciating them with the colors themselves. 

Much of the educational software IdeaTech produces is cre- 
ated by others on a freelance basis. IdeaTech offers a free as- 
sessment of the software it receives from others. The Eckerts 
evaluate the submissions from both technical and educational 
perspectives. Programs also spend several months' time in a 
classroom environment. 

All programs run in either DOS and are available as part of 
a subject-area package (Mathpack-l and Languagepack-1) or 
individually. 

Micro Power and Light, 12820 Hillcrest Road, Suite 224, Dal- 
las, TX 75230; (214) 239-6620. Contact: Ed Frantz. 

Founded by Ed Frantz in the winter of 1979, Micro Power 
and Light devotes all of its efforts to the development of edu- 
cational software for the Apple II. Courseware categories in- 
clude math, science, language arts, and tools for teachers. All 
of the programs the company markets are created on con- 
tract by practicing educators. 

The company's wide-ranging and somewhat unusual prod- 
uct line is primarily a product of Frantz's belief that good 
courseware is created when teachers make programs about 
those subjects they're qualified to teach that interest them 
most. The company also attempts to produce courseware for 
subject areas that are not being addressed by software cur- 
rently on the market. Examples include their programs Map 
Reading, Advertising Techniques, and Scientific Method. 

Important aspects of Frantz's role include making certain 
that the teacher's instructional strategies remain intact once 
they have been translated into courseware and determining 
whether there is indeed a market for a particular program. 
Products are field-tested in various school settings and refine- 
ments are made based on the results of an interactive process 
between creators and users. 

Program Design, Inc. (PDI), 11 Idar Court, Greenwich, CT 
06830; (203) 661-8799. 

Program Design came to life in March 1978; John Victor, 
Lyn Sandow, and Jenny Tesar are the firm's working part- 
ners. Most of the educational software the company produces 
is sold to home users, rather than to the school market. 

Victor's fifteen years' experience in educational technology 
brings a special perspective to the company, seen in the soft- 
ware they produce. Step by Step, the company's beginner's 
course on Basic programming, reflects this background. The 
New Step by Step is a revision and expansion of the original 
program. The package includes two disks, two audio cas- 
settes, and a workbook, and learners receive instruction on two 
levels, visual and aural. The company also plans to issue Step 
by Step II and ///, programs that expand upon the material 
covered in the originals. Topics will include the Apple memo-

ry map, the meaning of hexadecimal codes, the fundamentals 
of disk operation, how to write files, and so on. 

The company is also hard at work on a machine language 
that will enable beginners to attain a theoretical understand- 
ing of machine language by means of simulation. 

Sliwa Enterprises, Inc. (SEI), Box 7266, Hampton, VA 23666; 
(804) 826-3777. 

Steve Sliwa uses various mainframe computers in his work 
at NASA, but since late 1980 he's been spending a lot of time 
working and playing at his Apple. Consisting primarily of 
study aids for exams like SAT and GRE, the company's prod- 
uct line grew out of Sliwa's thinking back to his own experi- 
ence preparing for these kinds of tests. Sliwa asked himself 
what kinds of tools he would have liked to have on the Apple. 
SEI's Verbal Skills Pak, Math Skills Pak, and German, 
French, and Spanish programs are his answer. 

The Verbal Skills Pak consists of three programs — Vocabu- 
lary Builder, Word Analogy, and Sentence Completion (all 
three available individually) . The most recent version of Word 
Analogy offers learners a hint option. Part one of the Math Pak 
helps students improve their skills in jirecalculus algebra, 
geometry, and trigonometry; then in part two, learners move 
into more advanced geometry and trigonometry, accom- 
panied by graphic displays of the problems (both parts of math 
are also available individually). The language sldlls programs 
can be used to move from foreign language to English or from 
English to the foreign language, depending upon preference. 

All of SEI's programs have a database format and an edi- 
tor that allows the user to add to and alter data lists. This 
makes the programs versatile, ongoing tools for learning. SEI 
also plans to release two new programs soon, both in the ex- 
pandable/modifiable database format. The first is Acro- 
nyms/Abbreviations (quick, what does SEATO stand for, any- 
way? . . . how about RBI?) . The second, Foreign English, is a 
database of foreign words and phrases that are used in every- 



day English. It gives users the correct translation (in either di- 
rection) , pronunciation, language of origin, and literal trans- 
lation, if necessary. 

Sterbng Swift Publishing Ckimpany, 1600 Fortview Road, 
Austin, TX 78704; (512) 444-7570. Contact: Wayne Roe, Sterling 
Swift. 

This well-established book publisher offers numerous books 
about computers, including Computer Literacy: Problem 
Solving with Computers , a text intended for use by 
junior /senior high and college students with no previous ex- 
perience with computers; Computers and Education, a hand- 
book for educators; and Microcomputer Systems and Apple 
Basic, an introductory level text on operating the Apple and 
programming in Basic. Teachers and parents will find the 
company's Apple II Educational Software Directory, pub- 
lished in collaboration with Apple Computer, an especially 
valuable source of information. 

Sterling Swift also publishes a "hands-on" tutorial on pro- 
gramming in Basic, consisting of two disks (or four cassette 
tapes) and a workbook. Designed to be used while the learner 
is seated at the computer, the workbook covers branching, for- 
next loops, arrays, character strings, functions and subrou- 
tines, graphics, advanced topics, and applications. 

The company has recently issued an on-line learning sys- 
tem designed for use in teaching elementary mathematics. 
This class-tested software was written by three former class- 
room teachers whose company is called Courses by Comput- 
ers. This is the only program of this sort we know of that is of- 
fered in both EngUsh and Spanish. 

Making Connections. In an earlier installment of this col- 
umn, we brought up some pressing questions. One was: How

tional software determine what's out there and whether it 
meets their needs without wasting precious time and money?

publications have sprung up across the country in response to 
the need for accurate information about software. Now TERC 
tTechnical Education Research Centers), a nonprofit re- 
search development organization based in Cambridge, Mas- 
sachusetts, hopes to provide an answer. TERC plans to bring 
together users and experts across the country by taking ad- 
vantage of the very technology it is conveying information 
about. 

Since its inception in 1965, TERC's concern has been the 
study of social and technological change. Their goal has been 
to apply their knowledge to the improvement of education. In 
recent years TERC has devoted much effort toward the pro- 
motion of microcomputers in the classroom. Now TERC is in 
the process of establishing SET-NET (Software and Educa- 
tional Technology Network) . This experimental electronic net- 
work is designed to test whether an electronic network is a 
viable way of providing educators with useful information and 
educational software evaluations at a reasonable cost. An- 
other goal of the SET-NET experiment is to develop three pi- 
lot databases — one on Logo procedures, another on software re- 
views emphasizing science and math programs, and a third on 
educational software for the handicapped. 

To conduct its experiment, TERC is bringing together a 
small network of educational software experts and users who 
will share information with one another via the Source and 
EIES (Electronic Information Exchange System, run by the 
New Jersey Institute of Technology). SET-NET participants 
will include a core group of twenty educational software ex- 
perts (five general experts and five experts in each of the three 
applications areas) . Once the three pilot databases have been 
created, a group of teachers and school librarians in the Bos- 
ton area will use SET-NET and evaluate it and the databases. 
Plans call for expanding SET-NET and its databases if the ini- 
tial experiment is successful. This means that educators 
across the country may eventually be able to take advantage 
of SET-NET via the Source and/or the EIES networks. A re- 



port on the project is being prepared now, as is a detailed plan 
for a year-long test of the SET-NET. Further information can 
be obtained from TERC, 8 Eliot Street, Cambridge, MA 02138; 
(617) 547-3890. 

Conference Calendar. Computer-Using Educators (CUE) 
will hold its third annual fall conference October 1 and 2 at In- 
dependence High School in San Jose, California. The conference 
features hands-on workshops FViday afternoon (preregistra- 
tion required) , a Friday evening banquet, and speakers, work- 
shops, and exhibits all day Saturday. You can obtain further in- 
formation by contacting: Computer- Using Educators, Box 
18547, San Jose, CA 95158; (408) 288-7642. 

The Educational Computer Consortium of Ohio (ECCO) 
has announced that its second annual Educational Computer 
Fair will take place October 16 at Cleveland State University in 
Ohio. Described as "a fair by educators, for educators," the 
event will feature forty workshops for beginning and experi- 
enced computer users, along with discussion groups, exhibits, 
and student demonstrations. The presentations should be of in- 
terest to educators of kindergarten through twelfth-grade stu-

THE BASIC 



Solution 

By Wm.V.R. Smith 



Among the most valuable computer programs ever writ- 
ten for the business marketplace are the spreadsheet 
calculators. Electronic spreadsheets have become as valu- 
able to the business marketplace as Baiiic is to the beginning 
programmer. 

This month's Basic Solution offers BasiCalc, an electronic 
worksheet in Basic that is easy to use and readily expands to fit 
your system. An electronic calculator at heart, BasiCalc con- 
tains the basic mathematical functions, some spreadsheet 
functions, and various styles of data representation. 

BasiCalc brings together many of the Basic subroutines 
that have appeared in this column during the past year. The 
first Basic subroutine. Dollar Formatter, is utilized in the global 
default output section of BasiCalc. Video Tape Calculator was 
the main catalyst for BasiCalc. 

The subroutine that is the heart of BasiCalc is the Input 
Calculator from the February 1982 issue. This one routine per- 
forms string array parsing and all the math functions of Basi- 
Calc. 

BasiCalc uses two string arrays. The first one can be called 
the input array. The user types into a cell of this input array, 
and the Input Calculator scans each cell and tries to perform 
its function. The result from the input calculator is sent 
through Dollar Formatter, if necessary, and then placed in the 
adjoining cell of the second array. Each cell of the output ar- 
ray is truncated or expanded according to the column-width 
value. 

The second array can be called the output array. BasiCalc 
reads each cell of the output array and presents the proper 
cells on the video screen. 

Many other routines could be added to BasiCalc, but bear in 
mind that each addition increases the chance of the Basic 
program becoming large enough to cause string memory 
problems. 

Applesoft has an irritating habit of "going away" for a few 
seconds to a few minutes to clean up the array space. The cur- 
rent version of BasiCalc was constructed to avoid this prob- 
lem. All Applesoft programs will benefit as soon as a fast 
"free" routine is invented. 

BasiCalc uses a worksheet of ten columns by seventy lines. 
The screen display is twenty lines of thirty-seven characters. 
Each column width can be individually adjusted to your re- 
quirements. Columns are labeled A through J, and lines are 
labeled 1 through 70. Answer cells are addressed by column 
letter and row number; for example, Al through J70. 

BasiCalc starts with an inverse bar over location Al. 

The top right hand comer of the video screen has an indi- 
cator that shows the current cursor directions. The space bar 
changes the direction of the indicator. The arrow keys move 
the Inverse bar around the worksheet. If the indicator is hori- 
zontal, the inverse bar moves from left to right. When the indi- 
cator is vertical, the inverse bar moves up and down. 

After you've placed the inverse bar over a location and 
typed a string or expression, BasiCalc will evaluate the expres- 
sion and place the evaluation under the inverse bar. 



BasiCalc is also available on disk. Included on the disk is 
the spreadsheet in Basic and in compiled form using two of the 
popular Applesoft compilers. If you're interested in receiving 
this disk send $8 to Softalk BasiCalc Disk, 11021 Magnolia Bou- 
levard, North Hollywood, CA 91601. 



Mathematical expressions such as 12 - 3 10 are evaluated 
from left to right. Expressions may contain answer cells as 
values, such as4 + A5'*B3; BasiCalc looks up the values of A8 
and B3 and then evaluates the expression. If an error is found, 
the answer cell contains a copy of the expression itself. 

The usable functions are +,-,*, and /. Parentheses are not 
functions, but the program can be modified to accept them as 
such. 

Answers are automatically converted to dollar format. Un- 
less the expression contains a value control, BasicCalc uses a 
colon and a value control symbol. :I converts the value to an 
integer; :$ converts to dollar value; :F converts to floating 
point; converts the answer to graph mode. 

There are a number of immediate mode commands. The 
arrow keys are immediate commands that move the inverse 
bar. The space bar changes the indicator direction; @ clears 
an answer cell; "!" recalculates the entire sheet; and "/" 
places you in the command menu. 

The command menu contains the following options : change 
current column width ; save work page ; load work page ; clear 
page; go to page location; and print to paper. 

The ampersand, &, initializes the sum function that adds a 
row or column of numbers together. 

It is important to note that there are no Onerr statements in 
the listing. Onerr statements can cause a world of problems 
when typing and debugging a long program. Typing errors 
are much easier to find in code without Onerr statements. 
BasiCalc eventually requires an Onerr statement only to trap 
control-C. 

We strongly recommend compiling the Applesoft listing 
that follows. The Basic program operates remarkably fast; 
however, once you're familiar with its operation, Applesoft's 
fastest may seem pretty slow. 

A major reason for writing a program in Basic is ease of 
modification. If you think you've found a significant modifica- 
tion for BasiCalc, send it to Softalk BasiCalc, 11021 Magnolia 
Boulevard, North Hollywood, CA 91601. If your routine is the 
first chosen to be added permanently to BasiCalc you'll win a 
copy of that other Calc, and your update will be published in 
Basic Solution.

new articlfs. rt'vifws and C'\ aluatinnv. Jtidj;in^ from the rcspdnsc 
iK t nrdcd tlif lirst I'dition. w hich imniediattU M)ld out, there is n 
jireal iicet! for a niiide tu tlic hundreds of prcitfrani.s thai compete 
inr Ihe Apple owners dullars. With the infroductitm of the Z8ff 
eard, choices ^et e\en harder concernint; uhat to purchase: 
therelnrc. we dedicate tiiis bf«>k to you, the consumer. We hope 
\(tu w ill use it for a jiuidr and a.v a reference to assist you in mak~ 
inj.; intc-llij^ent and uifornied decisions when purchasing software. 

(iurrently. the Apple C^omputer owner is presented wUh a 
hewiiclerinif selection of software from which to choose. On the 
one Iiand. this should please you in that, as the owner of prohabh 
the most popular micro-eomputer in the world, sou ha\'e a wide 
and rapicily growinii sdt^ction of software from which to choose. 
On the other hand, this wide and grow ing selection presents some 
problems. The vast majority of retail computer store staff people 
simply just do not have the time to adeciuately review each new- 
piece of softw are that comes in their store. The problem is com- 
pounded if the new program Is an extensive or complicated (me. 
such as an accounting package or a word processing system, or a 
comprehensive data base management program. This does nut 
mean that store personnel do not want to give you the best service 
[jossible; it's just that it is an almost impossible task. If you pur- 
chase software through the mail, the risks that you assume, 
without a reliable guide to assist you should be apparent. 

Other pitfalls aw ait the tminformed buyer. For instance, in too 
many cases you cannot by the appearance of the package whether 
the program recpiires Integer Basic or Applesoft Basic or whether 
it needs 16. 32 or 48K of RAxM. it h also often difficult to tell 
w hen you purchase a program on tape whether it can be trans- 
ferred to disk or. if a ciisk program is purchased, whether it can 
be copied or not. 

Another area that can present problems to the buyer is the 
similarity of software. A well-stocked computer store may 
po.ssibK offer five different word processing packages, four 
assemblers, ten different ad\enture type games and/or several 
mail list programs, (the choices seem endless); all of which have 
obvious advantages and disad\ antages as well as different prices. 

The goal of "The Book" is to eliminate as many of these poten- 
tial problem areas for the software buyer as possible. 

\A'e w elcome any comments or criticisms from readers that will 
help us in reaching this goal, 

'Obviously, Apple and Apple Computer Co. is mentioned many 
times throughout "The Book." Apple II is a registered trademark 
of Apple Computer Inc. 




The one necessary book that should 
be on all Apple Computer owners shelves.

SPOCK IS DEAD! 

Now you know the bod news. The good news is that Roger Wagner's Assembly Lines: The Book is 
hotter than o photon torpedo. 

Wagner takes your Apple's 6502 on a mission of fourteen chapters and five appendixes. You and 
your computer will boldly go into a universe of loops, counters, branches, addressing modes, and 
sound generation routines. 

"With time and practice you will develop your own skills at creating efficient machine language 

routines, but that process can be assisted by examining the techniques that others have de- 
veloped in previous programming efforts," writes Wagner. 

"I have tried in this book to provide a reasonable mix of programming techniques, along with the 
usual ration of new commands." 

$19.95 gets you more than 270 pages of graphs, listings, and exercises. Written in a style 

Wagner had fifteen months to polish in the pages of Soffalk, Assembly Lines: The Book is a must 
for anyone serious about trekking through the universe of machine language programming on 
the Apple II. 

Assembly Lines: The Book is available at finer computer stores across the galaxy or directly from 
SoHalk. If you order from Softalk, please add $1.50 for shipping and handling.

Robots are here and they are changing the world we live in. From bulky industrial 
welders to fantastically complex planetary probes, robots are sure to make our lives a little 
easier. Robots will get much more sophisticated in the decades to come; by the next cen- 
tury they may be our model citizens. 

But will robots be immune from the human weaknesses that usually attend a high level 
of intelligence ? On the cover of our August 1981 issue we fantasized what a humanoid robot 
may look like in the future. We also gave this highly developed mechanical man the hard- 
est task we could devise— contemplating an object and its significance. 

Will robots ever be able to sit and think about something that is not directly related to 
performing a task? 

So/talk can't answer that question for you, but we can help you contemplate the un- 
known future in a special way. We commissioned grapliics artist Robert Zraick to do 
August's cover with a poster in mind. The robot contemplating a bite is evocative both of 
Rodin's The Thinker and the Genesis passage on the Garden of Eden . . . not to mention the 
possible significance to our favorite technological fruit. 

The artist and Softalk are sharing in the profits from the poster. Softalk will distribute 
its proceeds to individuals developing Apple tools to help the handicapped. Softalk guaran- 
tees 100 percent distribution of its monies. 

In addition to the posters, which are sold at $8.00 (plus $1.S0 to cover shipping and han- 
dling) , some of the two hundred artist's proofs, signed by Robert Zraick, are still available 
at tlS each. 

The size of the poster is 24 inches by 34 inches. The artist's proofs are hand-numbered and 
hand-signed, and each is accompanied by a certificate giving Its number and guarantee- 
ing that only 200 are being distributed. 

Robert Zraick's art will grace any computer room, and your purchase will help others 
become more self-sufficient.

One sign of the vitality of the Apple marketplace was the number of 
women in key positions. From the left: Bessie Chin, outhor of PFS: 
Graph from Software Publishing Corp.; Doreen Lawrence, general 
manager of Great Lakes Digital Resources; Grace Zimmerman, mar- 
keting manager of Microcom; Kothy Bradley, sales rep for Strius Soft- 
ware,- Judy Landau, Applied Software Technology, showing poten- 
tial customer Bob Amiro her husband's Versaform program; Lisa 
Schachter, soles education rep for VisiCorp; and Mary Carol Smith, 
president of Avont-Garde. Big companies were there also: Rick Lew- 
ark represented Dow Jones; major board game producer Avalon Hilt 
was represented by Richard Bamberg, Jackson Dott, William Volk, 
Dotf s June bride Robin, and Greg La Flomme; ond, of course, the 
group from Apple. 



Some of the software authors demoing their products were from left: 
Virginia Lawrence and Steve Modigon of Human System Dynamics; 
Richard Orban of Riverbonk; Michael Berlyn of Sentient, shown with 
Alan and Barbara Garber from Sentient's business side; and Roger 
Tuttlemon of Sensible Software. Other software purveyors were Ron 
Ericson for Piccadilly and John Lund for Great Plains Software. Phil 
Wershbo of Southern California Reseorch Group showed his key- 
board adapter. Among the vendors of monitors were Tom Cunning- 
ham from Sanyo and the Electrohome group of Don Leach, Jim and 
Betsy Piper, Cathy Mello, and Jim Stewort. 




Talking Apples were much in evidence: Andy Clore showed Echo from 
Street Electronics; Jim Anderson demoed the Mimic speech synthe- 
sizer, and F, William Shea touted the Type-'N'-Talk program from 
Votrox. There were dozens of vendors with thoughtful peripheral solu- 
tions to Apple user problems. Among them were Tim Farris of Quad- 
ram with the Microfazer printer buffer; Michael Mock of Rano Sys- 
tems with floppy disk drives; Tom Knowles of Corona Data Systems 
with a five-megabyte hard disk; Gory Angel of Practical Peripherals 
with the Microbuffer printer buffer; and John Nosek of Xebec with a 
hord disk kit. Other business was conducted at the Festi Phil Wood 
and John Sullivan of distributor Leading Edge chat with DatoMost's 
Dave Gordon. 



Mer* rtian 300 exhibitors showed in excess of 7,000 products at 
May's Applefest in Boston. They were bidding for the attention 
of approximately 20,000 attendees during the three-day affair. 
Apple furniture is getting to be a big and sophisticated business: 
Elizabeth Hovey showed off the Stotion II from Trace, while 
Frank Jedziniak proffered the Cool Stack Sentry II. Industry in- 
siders present but not exhibiting included Silas Warner of Muse 
and Patrick Dillon of Berliner Computer. The most specialized in- 
terest group present was the Zork Users Group, represented by 
Deborah Deutsch, Eric Meretsky, and Rocky Cardausco. 





^acro Convention of Micro Foiii 



Different approoches to graphics were evident. Stoneware introduced the Graphics Processing System, which 
uses a graphics tablet. Involved were Susan and Mike Belling, Ron Lubman, Frank Diffley, Ken Klein, and 
Richard Blum. Daniel Johnson of Cascode Graphics Development showed an Apple-aidea drafting system. 
Kile Mullen of Computer Stotion demoed the Computer Portrait Subsystem, which uses a dithertizer; and 
David Turner of Interactive Structures presented Pkaso, a graphics dump program. Esoteric applications in- 
cluded a laboratory automation system from Cyborg, shown by Mead Sommers and Joe Coruso; interactive 
video from Cavri, demoed by Alison Roth, Robin Maddern, Eleanor Seaman, and Chris Pino; a four-color 
data plotter from Houston Instruments, shown by Paul Kowalski of J. M. Lancaster; and Strowberry Tree's 
temperature probe for controlling both home and industrial processes, shown by Walt Macloy. 





There were word processors for every taste and application. John 
Risken of Sof/Sys displayed Executive Secretary; Armand Miloni and 
John Wagner introed Gutenburg, which is something more than a 
word processor and something less than a printing press; Kensing- 
ton's Phil Domiano touted Format II as a challenger to WordStar; 
David Guest, Wanda Voipe, and Bryan Freedmon displayed Beaman 
Porter's PowerText; Dr. Charles Stillmon of Action-Research North- 
west tub-thumped the Austrolion-bred Zordox; and Roger Fearing 
repped Magic Window. Investors had plenty to ogle also. Russell 
Lewis (right) explained Stock Market Softwore products to potential 
buyer C. L. Bankheod; Alan Friedman and Tom Tesser disployed the 
integrated Applecotions software. 




The Windy City wos repped by the micro folks: Dave Albert and Pa- 
tricia Glenn of Micro Co-op; Robin Freeman, Martha Erickson, Ston 
Goldberg, Evelyn Berg, and Kathy Cooper of Micro Lob. User groups 
were prominent. Tracy Licklider helped out at host Boston Computer 
Society's booth; Sally Davies and Kevin Donohoe manned the 
A.P.P.L.E. booth for the lorgest user group in the country; Peter Weig- 
lin, a new editor and publisher of Apple Orchard, covered Interna- 
tional Apple Core meetings held in conjunction with the Fest. Educa- 
tional software publishers were prominent, including R. C. Smith and 
Janet Dight of Universal Systems for Education; Bruce Friedland and 
Jock Cohen of Krell; Tim ond Jane Hartley of Hortley Courseware; 
ond Jean Gard and George Murphy of SRA.

This month we're going to return 
to word processing, which we fiddled 
around with a bit a couple of months ago. 
We'll design a routine that permits you to 
write one-page memos and then save 
them to disk (assuming you have a disk 
drive). The routine is straightforward 
and uses a lot of the techniques we have 
employed heretofore (which is the sort of 
thing certain authors always say right

The Text Window. Let's start by re- 
calling a command that we first used in 
February when we were learning the 
editing commands. Poke 33,33 changed 
the width of the text window from its 
usual forty columns to thirty-three. Turn 
on your Apple and enter the following 
command: 

HOME: POKE 32,10: POKE 33,20: POKE 34,10: 
POKE 35,15: VTAB 11 

Now type anything on the keyboard and 
watch the screen. What we have done is 
shrink the text window by poking in the 
four borders. The four commands work 
like this: 

Poke 32,10 moves the left-hand mar- 
gin over to column eleven (column one is 
poke 32,0). 

Poke 33,20 sets the width of the text 
window to twenty columns. The right- 
hand margin is equal to the left-hand 
margin plus the window width, in this 
case, column thirty-one. 

Poke 34, 10 sets the top margin to row 
eleven. 

Poke 35,15 sets the bottom margin to 
row sixteen. 

Let's not get into the question of 
whether or not these four definitions 
seem a little inconsistent. As Emerson 
said, "A foolish consistency is the hob- 
goblin of little minds, adored by little 
statesmen and philosophers and di- 
vines." Not a word about programmers 
there ! 

If your cursor is outside your newly 
poked window, it may behave erratical- 
ly. If you poke in strange things, like bot- 
tom margins that are above your top 



tyPougCarlston 



margins, you may expect your Apple to 
respond in kind. If matters really get out 
of hand and you would like nothing so 
much as to make a quick exit to normal- 
cy, type text and all will be forgiven. 

Saving Binary Files. This next part is 
just for those with disk drives. Any part 
of your Apple's memory can be saved to 
disk simply by using the bsave com- 
mand (it stands for binary save), fol- 
lowed by the starting point in memory 
and the length of the area to be saved. To 
test this out, boot a disk with some free 
space on it. Then clear the screen and 
type yourself a reminder to order sub- 
scriptions to Softalk for all your friends 
for Christmas (you can never plan too far 
ahead). When you're finished, press re- 
turn. You will probably get a message 
saying "sjmtax error" since your Apple 
thought you were trying to tell it some- 
thing and since Christmas is not a valid 
Applesoft command. 

Now type the following line : 



BSAVE MESSAGE,A1024,L1024 

Your disk will whir away for a couple of 
seconds. Type catalog and you will see a 
new file called Message on the disk. The 
B in front of it tells you that Message is 
not an Applesoft program at all, but a bi- 
nary file. Next, clear the screen or, even 
better, turn the computer off and then on 
again. Your message is forever lost un- 
less you can recover it from the disk. So 
try typing this : 

BLOAD MESSAGE 

There it is! Everything comes back, 
just the way you left it before you turned 
the Apple off. Now let's figure out what 
we've done. The bsave command has to 
be followed by two parameters. The first 
is the starting address in memory to be 
saved. The address is always preceded 
by the letter A (which may even stand for 
Address). The second parameter is L,

which is the length of the area in mem- 
ory to be saved. Therefore, our Instruc- 
tion up above told the Apple to save the 
area in memory from 1024 to 2048 onto 
disk under the name Message. 

If you recall our memory map, this is 
the area in the Apple memory that dis- 
plays the text page on the screen. The ad- 
dresses may be given either in decimal 
or in hexadecimal form. People who like 
round numbers could have written the 
same command as: bsave message, 
A$400, L$UOO. $400 is the hexadecimal 
equivalent of 1024. 

These two commands can be very 
useful. If you ever create a particularly 
beautiful display on one of the two hl-res 
screens, you could save that picture to 
disk with the same command: bsave pic- 
ture, A$2000,L$2000. 

The Memo Minder. Now it's time to 
forget about learning anything and to get 
on with programming. Let's take that 
little word processor from a couple of 
months ago and try to turn it into some- 
thing useful. 

The central input loop is a matter of a 
couple of lines: 

10 HOME : GOTO 100 
100 GET A$ 

150 PRINT A$;: GOTO 100 

Note how we left space at the beginning 
of the program for our subroutines (not 
that it will make any difference in speed 



for a program of this length, but it's a 
good idea to get into these habits). 

This program is going to allow us to 
write simple one-page messages to our- 
selves on the text page. When we are 
ready to save our file onto disk, we will 
need some way to enter a special code 
that tells the computer we are ready to 
save our message. The control keys are 
good "special message" keys. Let's add 
a line that takes us out of our loop if any 
control key is pressed: 

120 IF ASC (A$) < 32 THEN 200 

Now we have set aside an area of our 
program, starting at line 200, designed to 
handle special signals. The first such 
command that comes to mind is one that 
will save the screen to disk. We might use 
control-S as a slgpial to save: 

200 IF A$ = CHR$ (19) THEN GOSUB 20: PRINT 
CHR$ (4); "BSAVE";A$;",A$400,L$400": 
GOTO 100 

That's not as complicated as it may look 
at first. The letter S is the nineteenth let- 
ter of the alphabet, so CHR$(19) refers to 
control-S. The gosub 20 refers to a sub- 
routine, yet to be written, that will allow 
us to choose a new name for each file we 
want to save (otherwise we could only 
store one message per disk, which is not 
a very efficient use of disks). CHR$(4) is 
control-D, which, you may remember, is 



the special character you have to print in 
order to get your disk drive's attention 
whenever you want it to respond to some- 
thing printed in an Applesoft progfram. 
The rest of that line is just a bsave com- 
mand, with everything except for the 
variable A$ in quotes. You can throw 
away the semicolons if you like. They're 
just window dressing. 

Let's write that subroutine now. It 
doesn't need to say much: 

20 VTAB 23: INPUT "ENTER FILE NAME 

>>>>> ";A$ 

30 VTAB 23: CALL - 958 : RETURN 

We tab down to the bottom of the screen 
so that we won't disturb whatever mes- 
sage we have written. Then we ask for a 
file name and store it in the string var- 
iable, A$. Finally, we erase the prompt 
line and our answer using the call -958 
command that means, "Erase to the end 
of the page." 

We should add a control character 
that also permits us to load our mes- 
sages back onto the screen from the disk. 
Control-L seems like a logical choice : 

210 IF A$ = CHR$ (12) THEN GOSUB 20: PRINT 
CHR$ (4)"BLOAD"A$: GOTO 100 

And we had better add a line that puts 
ua back on track in case our nimble fin- 
gers type in some unintended control 
character:

300 GOTO 150 

The reason we went back to line 150 is 
so that an5i;hlng we tjrpe gets printed (re- 
member, the computer will read back- 
space and return entries as control char- 
acters, and we might actually want to 
backspace occasionally) . 

If word wraparound is to be avoided, 
you may recall the fix: 



130 IF POS(O) > 33 AND A$ = 
GOTO 100 



" THEN PRINT: 



Perhaps we would like an easy way to 
clear the screen from within the pro- 
gram, in case we want to start over. Let's 
use control-C (for clear) to do this (and if 
you aren't trying to figtire these out on 
your own before reading the suggested 
code in this column, then you are depriv- 
ing yourself of one of the true delights of 
programming). Here's one way to do it: 

240 IF A$ = CHR$(3) THEN RUN 

Another handy feature would be the 
ability to catalog a disk before you try to 
load or save a file. Typically, you don't 
think of this until you've already typed 
control-L or control-S, so the best place to 
add this feature might be inside the sub- 
routine that allows you to input the file 
name. Try writing a line of code that 
gives you the disk catalog if the user asks 
for a file with no name. Don't read an- 
other word until you've tried it on your 
own. Here's one way: 

25 VTAB 23: IF A$ = "" THEN PRINT 
CHR$(4);"CATALOG": PRINT: PRINT: 
GOTO 20 

There's just one problem with this 
nice little feature. If you have written 
yourself a memo, it occupies the top part 
of the screen (presumably) . If you then 
type control-S to save it and press return 
to check to make sure that you are about 
to save it under an unused name, you will 
be quite irritated to watch your little 
memo scroll merrily off the screen. What 
is needed is a technique to freeze the top 
part of the screen while permitting us to 
scroll the bottom part. ("Aha!" you cry. 
"Now I understand why you started 
this column off with all that academic 
stuff about peeking and poking text 
windows!") 

The first thing to figure out is how 
much of the screen to freeze and how 
much to allow to scroll. Of course we 
could just arbitrarily draw a horizontal 
line across the middle of the screen and 
declare that no memo can be more than 
twelve lines long. But we won't. Because 
it wouldn't be elegant. Because it 
wouldn't be efficient. Because it wouldn't 
allow us to use another brand-new com- 
mand. 

As you remember, pos(O) is a com- 
mand that returns the current horizontal 
position of the cursor. As such, it always 



returns a value between 0 and 39. What 
you need is a vertical equivalent of this 
command that will tell your program just 
how many lines of the screen you have 
used. Once again, Applesoft comes up a 
little bit short. There is no equivalent 
command. However, your Apple does 
possess the information we need, if we 
only know where to look. Address 37 al- 
ways contains the current vertical posi- 
tion of the cursor. It will contain a num- 
ber between 0 (the top line) and 23 (the 
bottom). If we add the following line to 
the program, X% will always represent 
the current cursor position: 

no X% = PEEK (37) 

Now let's use this new reference value 
to clean up a couple of lines in our code : 

25 VTAB 23: IF A$ = "" THEN POKE 34,X% + 2: 
PRINT CHR$ (4); "CATALOG": PRINT : PRINT : 
POKE 34,0: GOTO 20 

30 VTAB X% + 1: CALL - 958: RETURN 

As long as we're fiddling with the sub- 
routine, perhaps there's one other fea- 
ture we ought to add. What if, heaven for- 
bid, we thoughtlessly type control-L when 
we don't mean to? We stand on the verge 
of having our entire memo erased if we 
can't recover somehow and return to the 
main loop. You might add another line to 
the subroutine designed to send you back 
to the main program if you type some 



special name, like this: 

22 IF A$ = "HELP" THEN VTAB X% -I- 1: CALL 

- 958: GOTO 100 

This will work. However, it violates 
one of the cardinal rules of program- 
ming: Never leave dirty dishes on the 
stack! (Translation: Don't leave subrou- 
tines except by the exit ! ) There are times 
when the exit just doesn't exit to the right 
place, however, and for these special 
cases there is a special command. Re- 
call what happens when you use the 
gosub command — your position in the 
program is temporarily stored in an area 
of the Apple's memory called the stack. 
Then when you encounter a return, the 
computer looks at the stack and picks off 
the last address stored there, to which it 
then wanders. If you frequently encoun- 
ter the gosub command and less fre- 
quently run across return, there will be a 
build-up on the stack, which can ulti- 
mately have unfortunate consequences. 

Pop is a simple little command that 
does just what it sounds like it might. It 
pops the last address off the stack. There- 
fore, if we rewrite line twenty-two as fol- 
lows, all will be well in Dogpatch: 

77 IF A$ = "HELP" THEN VTAB X% + 1: CALL 

- 958: POP: GOTO 100 

Try it. As always, the proof is in the 
pudding. JM

JULY 1982 



To most people, baseball seems like an ancient sport, with 
its origins lost in the dim mists of American history. General 
Abner Doubleday is said to have encouraged his troops to play 
it during the Civil War — and by this country's standards, that's 
old. 

But that attitude is hardly fair to baseball or to the people 
who comprise the game today. Baseball has always had its 
statisticians and innovators working side by side with the to- 
bacco-chewing traditionalists who fly by the seat of their pants. 
Today, major league baseball usually leads the other profes- 
sional sports in new training and sports medicine techniques. 

Still, it may surprise some fans to learn that Apples have in- 
vaded the training rooms of three major league baseball 
team^: the Philadelphia Phillies and the Cincinnati Reds, both 
of which use their Apples for rehabilitating injured players, 
and the Texas Rangers, which has broader — and more confi- 
dential — uses for its Apples. (See accompanying story.) 

Travel now to Philadelphia and to Arlington, Texas, to meet 
some of the men and women who are bringing the modem 
reality of microcomputers to the Great American Game. 

A Rose In Any Other Game. Philadelphia: The name con- 
jiares up images of antique row houses, cobbled streets, the 
Liberty Bell, and one of the class organizations in the National 
League, the Philadelphia Phillies. World Champions in 1980 
and never far out of first place since, the Phillies have a repu- 
tation for quality and innovation. 

As one member of the Phillies management puts it, "We're 
very fortunate that the man whose family's owned this ball 
club for the last thirty years is good about spending money on 
things that have potential to pay off in the long run, because he 
sees it's not only going to help Ws ball club but help baseball as 
a whole." 

So it makes sense that the Phillies were the first baseball 
club to bring an Apple computer on board to help the staff. 
What may come from left field to some observers, however, is 
that the Apple is being used exclusively in the training room as 
an adjunct to the team's sports medicine program — not as ia 
number cruncher for baseball statistics. 

The story of the Phillies's Apple is the story of a symbiotic 




Bv LAti mm 




relationship between team trainer Jeff Cooper and Dr. Jim 
Richards of the University of Delaware's physical education 
department. The two men's paths crossed because of a shared 
interest in a device called a "Cybex isokinetic strength tester," 
and its applications to sports injuries and performance. 

Cybex machines have been around in training rooms and 
physical therapy clinics since the late sixties. The machine's 
leverlike resistance arm is used to exercise a muscle in an 
"isokinetic" contraction, that is, moving at a preset constant 
speed, no matter how strong or weak the muscle contraction. 

Getting the Green Light. A Cybex machine permits an in- 
jured muscle to exercise at its full potential without over- 
straining it. And because the Cybex also records the strengfth 
of the muscle's contraction through its full range of motion, the 
machine is invaluable in diagnosing injuries and charting 
recovery. 

As head trainer for the Phillies, Cooper was familiar with 
the Cybex from his undergraduate days at the University of 
Delaware and from graduate work at Indiana State, where he

on the base poths. Left: Dick Ruthven winds up and

earned the master's degree. A certified athletic trainer ("You 
have to be certified in the big leagues, that's the rule," he 
says) , Cooper routinely used the machine to test all the Phil- 
lies's players — especially the pitchers' arms. 

Which is why the team got its Apple. As Cooper tells it, "It 
started in spring training of '80. I did two hundred sixty-six leg 
tests on the Cybex and tested sixty-five pitchers with three arm 
tests on each side of the body at two different speeds. I had tons 
of raw data, but the front office wanted to know where each 
player ranked against the others as far as torque and joint ac- 
tion, so they could use this data. 

"Come July, after I analyzed it all longhand, I told them I 
had the percentile ranks they wanted, but nobody really cared 
by that time. The results were too far removed from the test- 
ing, and I could see that I needed a faster way to do the calcu- 
lations. In addition, I just wanted some simple manipulation of 
the data done — standard deviations and all that stuff." 

So Cooper journeyed back to the University of Delaware to 
consult with some of his former teachers in the biomechanics

section of the physical education department. There he was re- 
ferred to a new associate professor: Jim Richards. Richards, 
Cooper was assured, "eats that kind of stuff up." 

Digital Screwballs. Getting started for Cooper meant 
showing Richards the mountain of data he'd collected. "It was 
mostly torque readings of pitchers' arms," he says. "But the 
bottom line in sports is power, not torque. It's not your 
strength, but how quickly you can develop it." 

Before, Cooper had taken all the torque curves for the 
pitchers' shoulders and integrated them on a Hewlett-Pack- 
ard digitizer to find the amount of work that was done. 
Knowing the time from the Cybex, he could then derive the 
power. "I spent between eighty and one hundred hours sitting 
down in the lab doing that," he says. 

But Richards was an old hand at reading laboratory instru- 
ments into computers, and knew that the first step was cap- 
turing the analog (smoothly continuous) signal from the Cy- 
bex and translating it into digital terms for the Apple. 

First Pick In the Draft. How did the Apple get in on the act? 
"Jim did all that research — he's the guy with the smarts," 
Cooper says. "He just thought it was the most versatile ma- 
chine around." 



"I had looked at a number of machines, and the Apple 
seemed to be best suited for our needs," Richards says. 
"Furthermore, Apple, the company, is very helpful if you want 
to get inside to modify your Apple to meet your needs. They 
say, 'Ask us, we'll help.' Companies like Radio Shack or Pet 
sometimes seem to go out of their way to hide the insides of 
their machines." 

Before he undertook the project with the Phillies, Richards 
did enough interfacing in his own lab to satisfy most hardware 
hackers for life. "The Apple II in my lab is hitched up to a 
Cybex; to a force platform where it monitors three transduc- 
ers at around 400 Hz per channel; and we're in the process of 
hitching it up to three devices that comprise an oxygen 
analysis system, those being an analyzer, a CO^ analyzer, 
and a flow meter. Between those three pieces of equipment 
and a stress test, we can perform really accurate assessments 
of a person's ability to use oxygen." 

The Apple isn't overloaded, Richards explains, because he 
runs four channels off a vectored interrupt from an internal 
clock, which begins a sequence of reads from the A to D board 
which are then manipulated to produce all the data. The 
system is close to its limit, however, because he needs reads 



off the force plate at 350 per channel for eight channels, and 
"that's going to be close. 

"I take a lot of ribbing in the lab because of my Apple," 
Richards says. "The people at the university all use our main- 
frame for their research, so they see me hunched over my 
Apple and they think I'm playing with a toy. What they don't 
realize is the amount of computing power micros make 
available to one person. 

"In the kind of a lab I'm in, it's imperative that the data be 
collected at specific rates, and, up until about three, four years 
ago, nothing on the market shojuyif the PDP-1123 or 1140 could 





do that. And there weren't a lot of labs that could afford those." 

Warming Up the Bullpen. Another aspect of Apple 
ownership that makes it valuable in a laboratory is the avail- 
ability of peripherals — clocks, A to D boards, and all the other 
plug-ins. "You don't get that with any of the other machines," 
Richards remarks. "There are so many companies making 
peripheral equipment for the Apple that it's really easy to get 
almost anything you could need." 

If the Apple II is so good, why did the Phillies get an Apple 
III? Cooper explains: "At that time, the Apple III had just 
come out, and we didn't know that it had a lot of problems. For 



DEJUTIAL 



Mike Fitzsimmons, director of physical conditioning programs for the Texas Rangers, 
and Apple. 

The countryside in the half -suburban, half-rural Metroplex 
community between Dallas and Fort Worth is surprisingly 
lush and Texas-large. Steady prairie winds and morning tem- 
peratures in the middle 80s keep the area "cool and pleasant," 
at least according to local meteorologists, who don't know any 
better. On the bridge over Interstate 80 midway between the 
sister cities' skylines the panorama admits a view of Arling- 
ton Stadium, home of the Texas Rangers baseball team. 

Locals are proud of the stadium. One of the newest in base- 
ball, it was built expressly to lure the Rangers's franchise away 
from the District of Columbia. And although the young team is 
struggling in the standings, the Rangers are proud, too — proud 
of their elegant new clubhouse under the right-field stands and 
proud of the newest addition to that clubhouse. The Rangers 
have an Apple. 

More specifically, Mike Fitzsimmons, the Rangers's direc- 
tor of physical conditioning programs, has an Apple II in the 
team's ultramodern training room. "I do sense a little bit of 
pride over it," Fitzsimmons says, "when I hear the players 
talk to people they show around — family or visitors from out of 
town. They like to show off our clubhouse, which is one year 
old and the nicest in baseball, and they come back to the 
room there and say, 'This is the Cybex and this is the comput- 
er and this is what we do with the computer.' There's a unique- 
ness to it, and I think it makes them feel special, although they 
might not admit it." 

Called Up from the Minors. In a way, Fitzsimmons is an 
unlikely person to be a professional computer user. He got a 
B.S. in physical education at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, Cali- 



fornia, and went on to the University of Houston for the mas- 
ter's degree after working with the YMCA for two years. Los- 
ing his interest in going further ("I didn't see myself as a col- 
lege professor anymore"), he came aboard with the Rangers 
when the team created his position. 

Although Fitzsimmons 's boss told him about the plan for a 
computer when he was hired, "I didn't expect that I'd be the 
person responsible for buying it," Fitzsimmons says. "If I had, 
I'd have probably told him it was a mistake, because I didn't 
know a damned thing about computers. 

"To a certain extent I was just a layman being thrown out 
there saying, 'People, I need some help, we gotta do some- 
thing in a hurry.' But when the Apple kept coming up, I said, 
'Okay, get us one of those' — and in the end that probably was 
the one absolutely bright thing we did." 

Drafting a Free Agent. A second factor in choosing an 
Apple, Mike recounts, was discovering in Jan Kern, wife of 
then-Ranger Jim Kern (since traded to Cincinnati), a pro- 
grammer who already had an Apple in her home. 

"Jan has been the greatest help, beyond what any of us had 
expected," Fitzsimmons says. "And it made sense to have the 
same kind of machine. Now we can swap disks when we need 
to, and we plan to send stuff over the telephone between our 
Apples when she takes her family to Cincinnati for the rest of 
the summer." 

Kern was a lucky find indeed. At the time, she was working 
on the master's degree in statistics and computer science at 
the University of Texas, Arlington, to complement her bache- 
lor's from Case Western Reserve in Cleveland. "Jim was still 
playing for the Rangers when they got their Apple," Kem 
says. "He casually mentioned that if they needed any pro- 
gramming, I could help them out. So I got into writing some 
programs for the Rangers, and then he got traded to the Reds, 
and I'm still programming for Texas." 

Kern's Apple was originally a present. "My husband gave it 
to me," she says. "He talked to people in various computer 
stores and finally was sold on the Apple. I ended up getting a 
very nice package — the Apple with two disk drives, the 
SmarTerm eighty-column card, and the language card with 
Pascal. I'm just getting into Pascal, and I'm real impressed 
with it. It's similar to PL/1, which is what we use at the univer- 
sity. 

On the Warning Track. And what are the Rangers doing 
with their Apple? Here's what Fitzsimmons says:

Stadium; Ruthven and Schmidt await the outcome;

example, Richards couldn't read its books — this guy's got a 
Ph.D. in biomechanics and computer science, but he couldn't 
read the books they sent with it. Since then, they've sent out a 
new series of manuals." 

Richards adds that the Apple Ill's builtin A to D board, 
which the II doesn't have, led them to believe that it would be 
easier to program the Cybex routine on it. 

But Cooper hasn't found the Apple III particularly friendly. 
"It's not an easy machine for me, knowing notWng about 
computers," he says. "When I was an undergraduate, we did 
some minor stuff with computers, and I was told then you can't 

"We're going to be collecting fitness and conditioning data. 
We want to test each player five times — when they report, 
March 1, June 1, August 1, and at the end of the season, which 
would be October 1. That would give us some idea of the toll 
that the season takes, it would help us establish specific re- 
quirements for each individual's conditioning, and it would tell 
us if they'd been following their conditioning program or not — 
you can't fool machines. 

Conference on the Mound. The Rangers have more specif- 
ic — and more confidential — uses for their conditioning data, 
Fitzsimmons says. "Management might want to find out how 
healthy or unhealthy a player is, or how he compares with 
someone on another team. There might be a prospective trade 
involved, or a decision on whether to keep a player at this point 
in his career versus developing a younger player. A database 
of these physical measures will instantaneously tell us what we 
want to know. 

"We're using the Apple to do baseball statistics, but tradi- 
tionally baseball owners and the managers don't reveal their 
particular methods of keeping statistics on other players and 
clubs. I really can't talk about it." 

Kern does confess that the Rangers are using 255 Master to 
set up files on the players and keep track of physical fitness 
data, and there are plans to hook the Apple up to the Cybex as 
Philadelphia has. But she remains silent on what the Rangers 
are doing with the Human Systems Dynamics 's Anova statis- 
tics package and on the contents of their disks labeled "Balti- 
more," "Cleveland," "California," and the like. 

Although both Fitzsimmons and Kern are circumspect on 
particulars, Fitzsimmons is willing to share some predictions. 
He doesn't think Apples will appear in dugouts for a while, for 
example. "Not everybody in baseball is in tune with using sta- 
tistics for decision making during a game," he points out. "In 
any sport, there aren't that many people who rely on statistics 
on a move-to-move or inning-to-inning basis. 

"There are statistics coming out of our ears that could be 
used in those situations, but, unless people grow up with that 
kind of thinking, they just don't trust the process— they'd 
rather do it by the seat of their pants. 

"Also, in baseball there are a lot of people who intuitively 
know what's happened in every game and situation and what 
that information would jdeld statistically. But there are plenty 
of other people who would find themselves benefiting from an 
Apple on the bench, if they could trust the process." 



break it. But there's so much to learn about, so much to do, 
that I find that I'm playing on the machine when I should be 
getting other work done. 

"I've written four or five little programs on my own, slowly 
increasing their difficulty, and I want to put all my training- 
room inventories, and all my injury data, and all our fat testing 
on it, but right now it's all hand-done." 

But Cooper doesn't regret getting the Apple III — now. "I 
think the Apple III is more of a machine than we'll need to use 
in the next four or five years, but we wanted to buy that poten- 
tial because we knew that, once we got it, we'd think of more 
and more things to do with it." 

Double Play Depth. To cope with the problems, they 
worked their initial program out on the Apple II in Applesoft. 
"I don't know if you're familiar with the Apple Ill's history, but 
when it first came out, it really wasn't documented, and it 
didn't have everything that they claimed it had in it," Rich- 
ards says. "So we had to work around some of its little quirks."

They ended up with a program that has machine language 
subroutines linked by an Applesoft command structure. "It's 
all modular," Richards says. "If I want to change something, I 
just throw it out, which is why I prefer programming in Pas- 
cal — it forces you to do that. 

"The machine language areas of the program are at the 
very beginning to sample data through the A to D board. What 
it basically does is sample the A to D converters to make sure 
that the conversion is complete, put the data into the stack in 
the upper memory, and go back and resample. 

"It also tests for zero load to make sure that it's doing some- 
thing with the Cybex. If there's no load on the Cybex and the 
voltage is back to baseline, it kicks out and goes back to Basic 
routine. The Basic routine updates and checks out how many 
repetitions you're supposed to do, and finds out if there 're any 
more waveforms you're supposed to collect. If there are, it 
sends you back to the machine language routines. 

"So basically the machine language routines are involved

in all the data collection steps. It's the only way you can do it 
fast enough. Then Basic can handle all the data manipulation. 
It does the math. 

"The program creates three files. The first is a housekeep- 
ing file, with the date, the number of trials, and incidental in- 
formation like that; the second keeps data such as peak 
torques and speeds; and the third stores the waveforms." 

Richards says that there are still some things that need mod- 
ifying to make the program optimal for a clinical situation. 
He's developing menus to make it operable from one com- 
mand level, so that it will be responsible in a clinical setting, 
where operators don't always have time or enough computer 
expertise to change program routines. He also says the error- 
catching routines need to be extended and enhanced. "When 
we get it where we want it, we'll compile it, which should im- 
prove its speed, too."

eral Olympic-caliber ice skaters with him. 

"We found interesting things in one of the skaters," Rich- 
ards says. "In this girl, the ratio of extension to flexion 
strengths is 1 to 1 at the higher speeds, and very close to it at 
the lower speeds, which is what it should be. But another girl 
we tested had a problem getting off the ice — she'd jump, and 
just go nowhere. 

"In skating, you don't have a solid base to jump off of, so 
you have to take it as you can. A lot of the upward momentum 
comes from stopping the body parts on the way up, so you 
swing the free leg hard and then freeze it, and that gives you a 
tremendous amount of lift. 

"We found out that the girl who couldn't jump had an ex- 
tensor-to-flexor ratio of about 2:1 — she had absolutely no flex- 
ors at all. She could swing her legs sharply up, but she couldn't 
stop them; they would s-l-o-w down, and she'd just sit there on 
the ice." Proper training with sprints to strengthen her flexors 
will improve the skater's jumps, Richards says. 

One thing is certain — with or without hardware, the Cybex- 
Apple interface program would be a lifesaver for athletic 
trainers and physical therapists. Dedicated strength-testing 
machines are being marketed today that do only part of what 
the Phillies's Apple program does, yet these dedicated 
machines cost upwards of eight thousand dollars. "There are 
some stupid ideas out there that aren't going to last long," 
Richards says. "That's one of them. There's just no way 
they're going to sell that thing when we're on the market." 

That may not be a wild boast. Because almost every pro- 
fessional or college team and every hospital and sports medi- 
cine clinic has a Cybex already, the Phillies's software and an 
Apple II are a real bargain. 

But Richards's satisfaction is more than commercial. "It's 
exciting to me because of the research implications," he says. 
"Now people are going to be able to get data that they should 
have been collecting years ago. We've been looking too long at 
torque outputs, simply because it's been the only thing that's 
been easy to collect. But we've all known that there's other in- 
formation in that waveform that would tell us much more. 



"In most cases we're finding that power, which you only get 
by integrating the waveform, is more important than peak 
torque. And to get that, you need an Apple to help you sample. 
Without it, you'd go insane, because It takes you about twenty 
minutes to integrate a waveform the old way. So if you're Tun- 
ing about forty patients through your clinic a day, with two 
waveforms per limb and a half hour per wave, not to mention 
all the other paperwork, you can't do it." 

Setting Up the Hit and Run Play. So, though this may seem 
like the birth of yet another struggling software company 
(MicroCyb? — PhillieSoft?) , in another sense it represents a 
breakthrough in clinical data collection outside a laboratory 
setting. "Right now, physical therapists don't even bother to 
find the areas under the waveforms," Richards says. "They 
concentrate on finding peak value and take their little cali- 
bration cards and hold them up to the wave. That'is nice, but it 
doesn't necessarily give you the information that you need. 

"This program is going to get people in physical therapy 
and clinical settings to start thinking about the Cybex in terms 
of their patients' actual needs. 

"I get a little bit excited about that— that's the sort of thing 
that makes you feel a little bit useful. When you write a scien- 
tific paper, it's published and maybe four or five people who 
are already doing the same thing might read it. It's nice to do 
something that can be used." 

Success with the Apple has added a sense of new horizons 
for Cooper, too. "We're one of the most modem clubs in the 
game when it comes to training, and this Apple is part of that," 
he says. 

"I've even been encouraging management to consider us- 
ing our Apple on the field, for guys' batting averages and 
things like that," Cooper adds. "You know, this guy's been 
pitching fastball-fastball-slider and getting men out, or is it 
fastball-curve ball-slider? That kind of program is something 
we could really use. Baseball is full of percentages, like how 
often you get a certain guy out on a given pitch and data like 
that — it's got that kind of potential, and I think it should be ex- 
plored." IM

SOFICARD 
Symposhim 




by Gteg T!bbetts 

Welcome to the first installment of a multipart discussion of 
DDT.COM. This discussion of DDT is itself the final install- 
ment of a series on the assembly language utilities supplied 
with SoftCard. 

To recap for a moment, these last two months have been a 
sectioned exercise in the alteration of the Digital Research file 
dump utility, DUMP.COM, which is supplied on the SoftCard 
master disk in both source and object form. As you remem- 
ber, in May we covered the CP/M text editor ED.COM and 
used it to alter the source file for DUMP. These alterations 
were designed to produce three changes in the function of 
DUMP. First, we wished the program to respond to its en- 
vironment by internally configuring its output for either a 
forty-column or an eighty-column screen; second, we inserted 
code to force it to separate individual 128-byte records during 
output by the insertion of a blank line between them ; and final- 
ly, we wanted the relative address printed before each line to 
be separated from the data by a colon. These changes were de- 
fined and then installed using ED. 

In June, after some discussion of assembly language and 
assemblers in general, we took this altered source file for 
DUMP and demonstrated the use of the CP/M 8080 assembler 
ASM.COM that's included on the SoftCard master disk. The as- 
sembly process was fairly straightforward, and if you fol- 
lowed this exercise, you should have a working copy of DUMP 
that includes the three changes we installed. 

Gets the Bugs Out. If after doing the exercise just described 
you do not have a working program, this new series on DDT is 
for you. DDT.COM is the Digital Research 8080 debugger. The 
letters DDT actually stand for Dynamic Debugging Tool and, 
as the name implies, DDT is a utility that aids in the detection 
and removal of program bugs, the computer buzzword for pro- 
gramming errors. 

The concept behind DDT has probably been Implemented 
as many times as there are systems available. In the early his- 
tory of microcomputing, most machines came equipped with 
something called a front panel, which was nothing more than a 
series of switches (and possibly a display device, LEDs, and so 
on) that allowed the operator direct hardware control over the 
processor status and the bit values on the address and data 
buses. Using the front panel, the operator could display and 
alter memory, execute a single instruction, execute a series of 
instructions, cause the processor to halt, and so on. 

Having such a tool enabled the operator to have very primi- 
tive interaction with the system. Manipulating certain pro- 
gram addresses and the switches gave the operator almost to- 
tal external control over the execution of progframs. For ex- 
ample, a program that produced an error, but produced it in 
such a way that it was not easily related to a specific program 
section, could be executed step-by-step, and the status of the 
system could be monitored at the completion of each instruc- 
tion. When this step-by-step process was followed, the error 
usually became obvious rather quickly. While the front panel 
was extremely useful to people working at this level on the sys- 
tem, operators whose interest waa only in interacting with the 
computer through a high-level systems interface (accounting 
programs, word processing) found it to be of limited value. 

The evolution of the microcomputer in the last few years 



iniimiiiiimtmiiiiii 

has had the effect of reshaping it primarily as a tool for the end 
user rather than for the hobbyist or systems programmer. To- 
ward this end, such things as the front panel, with its empha- 
sis on a high degfree of technical knowledge, have been left by 
the wayside. The primitive controls provided by this hard- 
ware, however, were and still are very much needed, though 
by a smaller fraction of the user population. In many ma- 
chines, these functions have already been assumed by pro- 
grams — called monitors, housekeepers, and so on — that to one 
degree or another replaced or enhanced the front panel func- 
tions by simulating them in software. These software tools 
gave computer manufacturers the choice of providing a hard- 
ware solution, a software solution, or both. 

Primitive Surroundings. Such monitor programs, tjrpically 
provided in ROM, are usually geared, as were their hardware 
predecessors, to an extremely primitive, nondisk environ- 
ment; witness the functions of the Apple Monitor ROM, espe- 
cially the older one provided on the earlier Integer Basic Ap- 
ples. In addition to the currently available functions — display- 
ing memory, altering memory, executing a program, moving 
blocks of memory, and so on — the monitor programs provided 
the ability to step through a program a single instruction at a 
time, thereby simulating execution at an incredibly slower 
rate than normal ; the ability to trace progfram execution with 
processor status and register contents displayed after each in- 
struction (only somewhat slower than normal) ; and the abili- 
ty to do absolute, in-memory entry of 6502 mnemonics via a 
built-in mini assembler. 

In the sense that all these functions may be used to de- 
bug programs, these monitors are debuggers in the same way 
DDT is. DDT, however, provides a more sophisticated range of 
fiinctions by virtue of the fact that it is RAM-based and can op- 
erate from any location in RAM memory, and because it is de- 
signed to work in conjunction with the CP/M operating sys- 
tem. This increase in sophistication is due primarily to the fact 
that DDT allows control over the basic I/O operations of the 
system as well. Using DDT, it is possible, for example, to load 
disk files into memory, either overlaying or concatenating 
them to existing modules previously loaded. 

DDT is also educated as to the necessity of performing cer- 
tain kinds of activity, I/O in particular, at normal speed, called 
real time. Single-stepping or tracing through disk access code, 
for example, is performed at the operator's chosen pace until 
the actual timing-sensitive code or system calls are encoun- 
tered. At that time DDT will switch to real time, returning to 
the previous mode only when the code that must be performed 
in real time has been executed. These features expand enor- 
mously the utility of DDT over nonintegrated monitors (that is, 
monitors that do not work with the disk operating system) . 

Stick with It. More sophisticated debuggers than DDT are 
available ; Digital Research's SID and ZSID are two such pro- 
grams. Relatively few people continue to use ASM and ED af- 
ter their initial exposure, but most do continue using DDT. This 
indicates that DDT is a program worth learning to use. These 
columns will not make you an expert in the uses of DDT, but 
we hope they will give you the rudiments necessary to enable 
you to put this utility to effective use. 

DDT is capable of twelve fimctions:

Through proper use of these functions and the standard CP/M 
system calls, you can make the computer perform almost any 
normal function that it is otherwise capable of, yet do so in a 
controlled environment. DDT commands can be broken Into 
two categories : those that involve simple memory display and 
alteration and those that involve interaction with the system. 

The memory-handling commands are relatively straight- 
forward and are performed with DDT acting like any other ap- 
plications program. The program-handling functions, how- 
ever, involve much more sophistication, with DDT acting as a 
buffer between the program or routine and the operating sys- 
tem so that the program under examination will act as if it is 
running in memory by itself. 

Change of Address. DDT does this by first of all relocating 
itself to high memory directly under the BDOS module. When 
DDT is run, it begins at location 0100 hex, and by using the 
value of the beginning of BDOS stored at locations 6 and 7, it 
determines where it will have to relocate itself. The relocation 
address depends on how much memory is available. This relo- 
cation clears the transient program area, allowing programs 
that normally reside there to load and execute without inter- 
fering with DDT. DDT then places its own first address at lo- 
cations 6 and 7 so programs that look here to find the top of free 
memory will not overwrite it. 

Finally, because the instruction at location 5, which uses 6 
and 7 to jump to BDOS, now points to DDT, the normal ad- 
dress of BDOS is placed in DDT in a jump instruction that is 
activated whenever control is passed to that first DDT instruc- 
tion. In this way DDT is hidden from the system and is es- 
sentially transparent to programs running in memory. DDT 
also stores and updates within itself the contents of the various 
registers and the status of the processor after allowing an in- 
struction being examined to execute. This is done so DDT can 
display these contents when requested. It will appear to the 
user that he is in fact seeing the current processor condition. 

The final tiling DDT uses to control execution Is the restart 
function. This is a separate processor Instruction that causes 
DDT to halt further execution of the program immediately, go 
to a specific area of memory, and use the address It finds there 
as a vector to a service routine of some kind. Using this tactic, 
DDT can have the processor execute a single instruction and, 
by putting its own address in the vector and the restart In- 
struction immediately following the instruction to be exe- 
cuted, can have the processor return to DDT when it finishes. 
By retaining the original content of the location where it placed 
the restart, DDT can replace the content when finished, es- 
sentially leaving everything as It was before. 

Depending on where the restart is placed, one to many hun- 
dreds of instructions can be executed before stopping the proc- 
ess. This is called breakpointing and is a valuable tool in de- 
bugging operations because it allows you to execute portions 
of code in chunks that are as small or as large as appropriate 
to the situation, wiiile constantly monitoring the program's 
progress. This method enables DDT to maintain an environ- 
ment that looks to the program as though It is running normally 
within the system, when it is in fact running within DDT. 

Memory Serves You Well. We will now examine the memo- 
ry handling functions of DDT and demonstrate each of them in 
detail. We will save program manipulation and an exercise 
using our modified DUMP program for next time. By the time 
we finish with this multipart discussion, you should find your- 



self reasonably comfortable with DDT and with, at least, the 
rudimentary uses to which It can be put. It will be most helpful 
if you can continue to follow along using your computer as you 
did when we studied ED and ASM, especially when we get to 
the point of executing our new DUMP program. 

Before starting this session. Invoke DDT to bring it up and 
run it. With a copy of your CP/M master disk, or any disk con- 
taining DDT, in the drive, simply type its name, DDT, fol- 
lowed by a carriage return. You should see the DDT sign-on 
message and a minus sign or hyphen. This Is the DDT prompt, 
which is displayed anytime DDT is awaiting a command. One 
note of caution : during the use of commands that read or write 
areas of memory, do not attempt to access the memory loca- 
tions from EOOO to ElOO. To be absolutely safe, no addresses 
from EOOO to EFFF should be accessed without specific pur- 
pose. The addresses from EOOO to ElOO are the hardware con- 
trol addresses for the Apple I/O slots and indiscriminate ac- 
cess to them can do nasty things like turn on your disk drives in 
write mode, and so on. Although the larger range Is safer, 
since ElOO to EFFF Is the area reserved for program ROM 
space for each of the peripheral cards, in the case of cards 
(like the SoftCard, for example) that have no ROMs, access- 
ing some of these addresses will have unpredictable effects. 
For the SoftCard, accessing ExOO (where x Is the slot number) 
will turn off the Z80. Usually the system can recover from this 
occurrence, but why take chances? 

The first job of any debugger is to enable the user to 
examine and alter individual memory locations. This is one of 
the keys to front panel simulation ; DDT accomplishes this task 
through the use of the S (for set) command. Type S now, fol- 
lowed by a return. What happened? You got a question mark 
and a repeat of the DDT prompt. You see, some DDT com- 
mands require parameters following the command and others 
do not. The S command is one that requires an address pa- 
rameter to function. 

Now type SlOO (return) . You should see the address you en- 
tered, 0100, displayed. (Note: All addresses and data shown by 
DDT are displayed In hexadecimal format, and therefore all 
numbers shown in the column should be assumed to be In hex.) 
Following this address is a two-digit number, in this case, 01, 
and the cursor has jumped to the right of the 01 and stayed 
there. DDT is telling you that the memory location 0100 cur- 
rently contains 01, and that it is now waiting for your input as to 
what to do with that location and value. 

Keep It Legal. At tills point, any legal single-byte hex num- 
ber you type followed by a return will be Inserted In that mem- 
ory location, while a return by itself will leave the current con- 
tents as is. In both cases, however, the next sequential memo- 
ry location will be displayed with the same resultant wait for 
input. A period followed by a return at any point of input will 
cause the S command to be terminated and return you to the 
prompt. Illegal values entered as numbers will also cause a re- 
turn to the prompt, but with the DDT question mark Indicating 
an error. The S command Is one of the most useful of the DDT 
commands and Is often the means by which patches to pro- 
grams are distributed. A series of hex bytes is listed and, using 
the S command, the series is installed In the program after 
loading it into memory. Such lists are called hex dumps. Short 
programs can even be exchanged in this fashion using the S 
command to input them and the CP/M SAVE command to 
save the result to disk. 

The next command is D (for display memory). This com- 
mand's primary function is to give you a quick view of the con- 
tents of memory, 192 bytes at a time. Values In hex are dis- 
played in twelve rows of sixteen bytes each, preceded by the 
address of that sixteen-byte section and followed by a series of 
periods and other characters that correspond to the values. 
(Note : If you're using a forty-column screen, DDT will display 
in a different format to keep the display within a forty-column 
line width. In either case, if a value corresponds to a printable 
ASCII character, the character is displayed; otherwise, a 
period is displayed in its place. This allows you to view the con- 
tents of memory in both its numeric and Its ASCII forms.) 
Type a D (return) now. You should start seeing a memory dls-

Now, 
withMicrofazer 
YOU can compute 
wMlevou print. 

Time is money. You own o computer 
system because you know that it 
can save you money by simplitying 
office procedures and reducing the 
time involved in payrolls, occounting, 
word processing and those other 
wonderful things we oil must do. 
Time is an important resource which 
should not be wasted. Even though 
your system seems efficient, you 
could be wasting valuable time if 
you ever wait for your printer to 
finish printing before more infor- 
mation con be entered into your 
computer. 

NO WAITING. Now with Microfazer 
by Quodrom there will be no more 
waiting. 

The Microfazer is on inexpensive 
universal printer/buffer that can be 
used with all popular micro-com- 
puters and parallel printers. Micro- 
fazer receives information from the 



computer at up to 4000 characters 
per second (your computer thinks 
the printer is printing this fast), 
holds it until your printer can handle 
it, and then sends it on to the printer. 
Controlled by a custom LSI, Micro- 
fozer uses standard Centronics 
signals and is powered by the printer 
or on inexpensive external AC 
adopter. Buffering of 8K, 16K, 32K 
or 64K is available. 

EASY INSTALLATION. The Microfazer 
is in a small case (3.5" x 7" x ]"). It 
is engineered to be plugged directly 
into the input port of the Epson and 
other similar printers. Installation 
can be completed in less than 60 
seconds. How's that for not wasting 
time! Most other Centronics com- 
patible printers can be attached by 
using on adopter coble, 

FLEXIBLE. If you should purchase a 
faster printer later, just unplug and 
add to your new printer. Changing 
Computers? Microfazer is not com- 
puter dependent Wont to odd more 
buffer? No problem. Microfazer is 



user-expandable up to 64K. No 
other buffers come close in flexibility. 

LOW PRICE. Only $159 for 8K buffer, 
$199 (16K), $225 (32K) and $299 
for full 64K. Serial-to-Porallel and 
Seriol-to-Serial versions ore 
available at slightly higher prices. 

QUADRAM QUALITY. The Microfazer 
was designed with performance 
and reliability in mind. With a one 
year warranty, you get Quodrom 
Quality of a surprisingly low price. 

ASK YOUR DEALER. If you are 

currently wasting time waiting on 
your printer, see your local personal 
computer dealer. If your dealer is

play that begins at 0100 and shows the DDT copyright mes- 
sage in the ASCII portion of the screen. This is the beginning of 
the DDT program itself. 

Knows Its Place. Type a few more Ds to see what happens. 
Did you notice that with each new execution the D command 
continued from where it left off? DDT maintains counters for 
the defaults of certain commands that, unlike the S command, 
do not require parameters. If you execute other commands in 
between the D commands, you'll find that when you return to 
D it will still continue where it left off. 

The D command may also be used with one address or two 
address parameters, for instance, D6500 or D6600,6900. With 
one address, the 192 bytes beginning with address 6500 are dis- 
played; with two addresses, the contents of memory from 6500 
to 6900 are displayed without breaks. Hitting any key during 
the display of memory will abort the display and return to the 
minus sign prompt. You'll also notice that a D command with 
an address parameter that does not begin an even sixteen-byte 
section — D5C, for example — will print on the first line only the 
number of bytes remaining to fill out that sixteen-bj^e section 
so that the rows that follow begin and end on even slxteen-byte 
boundaries. The D command is most useful as a means of 
quickly scanning memory contents. 

The next command we'll discuss is the L (for list) com- 
mand. This function of DDT takes memory and displays It as a 
disassembled listing of the op-codes and operands contained in 
the segment of memory being listed. Enough memory is dis- 
assembled in this fashion to make up twelve lines of screen dis- 
play. Just as with the D command, a separate counter is main- 
tained with an initial default address of 0100 so that subsequent L 
commands begin where the previous one left off. The command 
forms for the L command are the same as those for D; either L 
(return) , L followed by a start address and a return, or L foUowed 
by both start and end addresses and a return. Once again, hitting 
any key during the listing wiU abort the command and return to 
the DDT prompt. 

Blind to Valid Values. If you do an L now, you should see 
that it starts at address 0100 and displays two instructions, LXI 
B.lOlO and JMP 013D, followed by a series of register MOVs 
and MVIs. Further disassembly would eventually produce a 
?? = XX, where xx is a two-digit number. In this case, what's 
happened is that only the first two instructions of that se- 
quence are valid. The remainder of the twelve lines really 
constitute the ASCII DDT copyright message, but DDT has no 
way of knowing this, since the values that make up the mes- 
sage are valid op-code values as well. 

In our discussion last month of ASM, we touched on the fact 
that each op-code by its original definition will be followed by 
no operand, a one-byte operand, a two-byte operand, or, in 
some cases (though not in the 8080 Instruction set) , a three- 
byte operand. DDT's built-in disassembler recognizes which 
Instructions require what number of bytes for an operand (as 
indeed any disassembler must), and consequently breaks 
down the listing according to what it recognizes, regardless of 
whether the values were meant to be op-codes or not. When 
ASCII data is erroneously broken down in such a fashion, the 
mistake is fairly easy to detect, since most of the op-codes with 
values similar to those of the ASCII set are MOV and MVI in- 
structions. Since there's little use in having so many such in- 
structions in series, there's a high probability that this is ASCII 
data. Using the D command usually confirms such suspicion. 

It would be nice if all such disassembly were so obvious, but 
it's not. Remember we said that you will occasionally see the 
double question mark and some two-digit number? Well, when 
you see this, it indicates that DDT got to this point in its listing 
and found a value that had no analogous op-code where an op- 
code should have been. What's most likely happened (assum- 
ing of course that we're not dealing with a Z80 or 6502 specific 
op-code that DDT will also not recognize) Is that somewhere 
DDT began disassembling in the wrong place, starting on one 
of the bytes of an operand, for example. This is probably be- 
cause you specified the wrong address to start at, or because, 
due to the Inclusion of data in the program similar to the DDT 
copjnright message, DDT got off track by the time It arrived at 



T A L 1^ JULY 1982 

the next program segrment. Disassembly of large programs is 
by no means a straightforward task. It often requires that you 
follow the logic of program execution to separate data and 
operands from actual instructions; sort of an "If I were an 
8080, what would I do here?" kind of approach. 

Check for Effect. The next command we'll discuss is the F 
(for fill memory) command. This one is pretty straightfor- 
ward since it has only one form and one purpose. The form is 
an F followed by a start address, an end address, and a data 
byte. The purpose is to Initialize an area of memory to some 
specific value, usually to determine what effect your program 
is having on the area in question. If your program is supposed 
to be storing 00s in an area, initializing it to FFs and ninnlng 
your program will show you whether the program is function- 
ing properly. The only thing you need bear In mind with F is 
that the two addresses are inclusive, that is, both of them and 
all addresses in between will be filled with the value. Try an F 
command now of the form F1000,1FFF,BB, and then examine 
the area with the D command. Did it do what you expected? 

The next command is M (for move a block of memory) . No 
less straightforward than F, M is used to move some segment 
of memory, of a size you determine, from one place to an- 
other. The form of the command is M followed by a start ad- 
dress of the source segment, an end address of the source seg- 
ment, and the start address of the destination for this block of 
values. Once again, the start and end addresses are inclusive. 
This command Is most often used to relocate programs and 
data to some other area of memory dioring debugging, where It 
Is perhaps easier to observe them. It is also used to copy ROM 
code down into RAM so that it can be altered and tested. Try 
the command now by tj^ing M1000,1FTT',3000, and again check 
the result with D. Fast, wasn't it? 

Temporary Solution. The A (for assemble) command Is 
used when you wish to alter machine Instructions In memory 
to correct some problem but do not wish to make them per- 
manently part of the source file, at least not until you have had 
time to test them. As we discussed briefly in last month's 
column, this Is a very primitive assembler. It can translate 
8080 mnemonics and register names into the corresponding 
machine code values in conjunction with addresses you type 
in, but you are not allowed to use labels or symbols. Any tar- 
get locations of jumps, loads, or stores must be entered by en- 
tering their actual addresses. Also, since the assembler is In- 
capable of relocating existing Instructions (of moving every- 
thing up or down in memory and resolving the address refer- 
ences) , you must assemble into an area of memory that has 
sufficient space to hold your new code. This is done In either of 
two ways. The first way is to overwrite code no longer needed. 
The second Is to place a jump instruction — overwriting three 
bytes of existing code — in the area you wish your insertion to 
be. This causes the program to jump to a patch area in which 
you revive the overwritten Instruction, insert your new code, 
and add a jump instruction back to the original program to 
continue execution. 

The format of the command Is A xxxx, where xxxx Is the 
address to begin assembly. There is no default address. DDT 
will respond with the address and a waiting cursor to accept 
your new Instructions. With each Instruction assembled, the 
next available address for assembly will be displayed, and 
DDT will await input. Erroneous input will cause the address 
to be repeated without action taken. Like the S command, a 
period by itself will terminate the assembly action. If you wish 
to try this command, do some disassemblies using the L com- 
mand and then use A to copy these at some new address. 

This concludes our first session on DDT. So far we have dis- 
cussed the functions that relate to memory usage, alteration, 
and display. Next month, we'll begin looking at how programs 
are manipulated with DDT— how they are loaded, executed, 
and debugged.

diagnosis and I/O error handling. RECOVER recovers occidently 
deleted files.

subroutines. SUPER SCREEN is a must for any business use of the

via TWX,™ Telex,™ Mailgram™ or interna 
tional cable. It also brings you news, 
stock and gold quotes, foreign exchange 
rates, even sports and ski reports. 

Micro-Telegram is much better than a 
mechanical Teletype.™ It operates unat- 
tended. It automatically formats, files 
and displays messages. And, since you 
create and edit messages off-line at 
your CRT, it saves you the time and 
aggravation of punching and repunching 
paper tapes. 

Support you can rely on. 

When you buy Microcom's communica- 
tion packages, you're buying a lot more 
than just software. You're buying easy- 






Transfer graphics and data 
reliably and error free. 



to-use, reliable products with profes- 
sional documentation and knowledge- 
able customer support. And you're 
buying the convenience of a nation- 
wide dealer network. 

So if you're talking communications, 
you should be talkii^g to Microcom.

your local Apple or IBM computer 
dealer.

Businessmen 

Q. Do you have difficulty operating your printer when 
connected to a time-sharing computer? Are files 
you're trying to download too large for your system 
buffer? Does your host computer lose data when you 
send files to it? 

A. "The Professionals" incorporate printer ring buffers 
which allow slower printers to accept data at their 
own rates. Very large files are easily received by 
periodically saving the buffer to disk. Unlike some 
software which can lose data during disk saves, 
"The Professionals" not only direct the host to stop, 
but actually wait for it to respond before performing 
the save. After a successful save, the host is 
automatically directed to continue. This process 
may be repeated indefinitely. Lost data during send 
is virtually eliminated by the widest variety of send 
options available in any communications software. 
"The Professionals" ensure fast, reliable data trans- 
fer of any valuable business information. 



Authors 



Q. Does your line of work involve sending written 
material to others? Are you a program author who 
would like to send work in progress to a partner or 
client and know that it arrived intact? What would 
the ability to instantly send material or programs to 
anyone at any time be worth to you? 

A. "The Professionals" provide the ideal way to send 
your articles, manuscripts, reports, programs and 
technical documents to another computer with 
phone line access. Now you can work WHEREVER 
you want, and be assured that your data is sent to its 
destination quickly and error-free. In fact, compared 
to the fastest mail services, "The Professionals" of- 
fer immediate delivery and will save you the pur- 
chase price in just a few uses. 



Students 



Q. Are you bothered by limited access to your school's 
existing terminals? Would you like to be able to do 
your school assignments at home at your own con- 
venience? 

A. "The Professionals" allow you to access virtually 
any dial-up school or college computer system over 
standard telephone lines. This means no more 
waiting in line for an available terminal or hassles 
with malfunctioning school equipment. You can 
even prepare term papers or reports while off-line 
and send the completed work to the school com- 
puter for final printing. Best of all, you can work from 
home at the times most convenient for you.

Time Share Users 

Q. Are you tired of wasting time and money sending or 
receiving files with inadequate, poorly designed 
software? Do you find yourself manually performing 
the same lengthy log-in procedures over and over 
again? Would you like to automate these procedures 
for yourself and others? 

A. "The Professionals" allow you to send files which 
have been prepared in advance. They may then be 
transferred at any time, as quickly as possible — 
even to several different systems. No time is 
wasted reviewing information while on line; data may 
be captured by your computer or printer (or both) to 
be evaluated later at your convenience. These fea- 
tures assure minimum on-line time and therefore 
minimum on-line cost. 

"The Professionals" introduce macros that are more 
sophisticated than anything previously seen in com- 
munications software. These "hand-shaking" mac- 
ros allow you to perform complete multi-stage log-on 
sequences automatically; all you do is specify the 
system to be called. This eliminates sign-on errors 
and greatly simplifies operation of the entire system, 
not only for you, but for other less skilled operators. 

Bulletin Boards 

Q. Would you like to be able to take advantage of the in- 
formation featured on local bulletin boards and infor- 
mation services such as The Source, CompuServe, 
Dow Jones, and others? 

A. "The Professionals" open the world of modem com- 
munication networks to you. There are already 
thousands of these systems and networks in use na- 
tionwide. "The Professionals" provide an ideal way 
of accessing these systems. All 80 column boards, 
external terminals (even the 40 column screen), and 
currently available communications devices are fully 
supported, including the Hayes Micromodem II and 
Novation Apple CAT. All standard baud rates — 110, 
300, 1200 and others — are fully supported; BAUDOT 
too, if your computer is equipped with the Apple CAT 
modem. 



Clubs 



Q. Are there other Apple owners with whom you would 
like to exchange programs or files, but have been 
unable to do so because of limitations imposed by 
the software you now use? 

A. Any two Apples equipped with "The Professionals" 
can transfer ANY type or size file with complete error 
checking and correction. All of "The Professional" 
packages are fully conversant with each other and 
operate almost identically. For the first time ever, 
you can transfer compatible files to an operating 
system different from yours — error free!

PLAYING GAMES WITH 
YOUR RESOURCES ! 



Was financial management one of your justifications 
for purchasing an APPLE " computer? 

Are you really managing your finances or just using an 
expensive calculator to help balance your checkbook(s)? 

It takes a double entry system to do the job right. Why ? 

Less than half the financial transactions necessary to 
adequately manage your resources and plan your tax 
strategy can be accomodated with single entry systems. 

How can you use a double entry system without a 
refresher course in accounting? 

You can't, if you use software that simply automates 
the way people do things by hand, . . . but, with 
The ACCOUNTANT, by Decision Support Software, 
the power of your computer is harnessed to offer you the 
advantages of an automated double entry system even if 
you don't know a debit from a credit ! 

BEST PACKAGE EVALUATED' 
"For the home user (and perhaps in some 
less complex small business), the best package 
we evaluated was the Accountant by Decision 
Support Software." 

— Mind Your Business Dept., Softalk, Jan. 82 

Our users are equally impressed: 

"The ACCOUNTANT is not only very sophisticated 
and full of surprising features, such as automatic 
transactions and linkages to VisiCalc", but is very 
easy to use".

The ACCOUNTANT 
Finance Data Base System 

The ACCOUNTANT is a decision support tool that 
provides an individual or business with timely, accurate 
data to plan, monitor and control their finances. The 
detailed records contained in The ACCOUNTANT'S data 
base will enable you to itemize each and every legitimate 
tax deduction. DBCALC, a VisiCalc" interface, retrieves 
data from The ACCOLINTANT's data base and creates 
a VisiCalc " file of actual and projected financial data 
which can be used for financial simulations and tax 
computations. 

The ACCOUNTANT requires an APPLE II 
with 48K, APPLESOFT and single or dual drives. The 
system includes a master disk and a newly released utility 
disk (both in standard DOS 3.3 format), hardware key, 
and a comprehensive, easy to follow user's guide in an 
attractive binder $129 

DBCALC (with 1040 model included) 
requires VisiCalc " $20

SCREEN WRITER II is, frankly, the kind of word processor you would have 
developed foryourself if you were a programmer: strictly professional in its features, 
yet simple enough for even a beginner. And that's where we started. _ 

Sure, SCREEN WRITER gives you boldface, underline, global search/replace and form letter capabilities. Of course, it 
lets you eliminate the boredom of retyping redundant text. Certainly, it lets you generate up to four indices, has complete 
formatting capability as well as full editing of any DOS 3.3 text or binary (including APPLESOFT programs) . . . and many 
other wanted features. 

That's enough to make SCREEN WRITER a very good value in word processors. But, we wanted to make it the best 
value. And we did . . . by eliminating the need for you to spend hundreds of dollars extra for supportive hardware! SCREEN 
WRITER is the only word processor to offer true software based lower case, a 70 column screen and printer spooling* which 
allows you to edit while printing, for more efficiency. 

With these extra, money-saving features at no extra charge, we think you'll agree, SCREEN WRITER is the best value in 
word processors today. And it's yours at $ 129.95. WAIT! It becomes an even better value if you buy our SCREEN WRITER 
PROFESSIONAL package. Then you get the SCREEN WRITER and our $99.95 DIC-TIO-NARY (described on the opposite

No matter how good your 
Apple's word processor, the 
user is human. So, the odds are 
that spelling mistakes will 
occur in almost every letter, 
document, or proposal. Many 
errors will be caused by those 
who never won a spelling-bee 
and are addicted to 'creative' 
spelling. . .while others will be 
due to keystroke 'typos'. Either 
way, spelling errors can be em- 
barrassing to you — to your 
image — to your business. 



DIC-TIO-NARY 
solves the spelling 
problem for you, 
and does it at com- 
puter speed, easily 
and almost effort- 
lessly. How easily, 
how effortlessly? 
Well, with DIC- 
TIO-NARY you 
have the option to 
correct a word 
immediately . . . 

right at the time you're doing the spelling check. No 
waiting necessary. And if, by chance, you don't know 
the correct spelling of the word, you can go into the 
wordbook right then and there and have it displayed for 
you! (Ask for these features on competitive programs, 
no matter their price, and see how fast they change the 
subject.) We think you'll find that for helpfulness our 
DIC-TIO-NARY is on par with having your favorite 
English teacher or even Mr. Webster at your elbow! 




Saves you from creative speling 



choices, choices 

The.DIC-TIO-NARY will dis- 
play for you any word not listed 
in its wordbook and any mis- 
spelled word. It then offers you 
a choice of word-editing op- 
tions. For example: You may 
decide to ignore the word. You 
may have it marked in your text 
and /or on the printout, for later 
identification, correction or 
replacement. You may have the 
word automatically added to 
your wordbook. Or, you may 
immediately correct the spell- 
ing (using the 
wordbook for ver- 
ification, if de- 
sired) . . . and all 
occurrences of 
that word will 
automatically be 
' corrected through- 
out your text, keep- 
ing the original 
capitalizations or 
lower case letters! 



words, words, words 

The DIC-TIO-NARY starts you off with more words 
than you'll probably ever need: 25,000 of the words used 
most often. Plus it lets you add 3000 words of your own 
choosing, so you can customize it to your specific 
needs. (By making back-up "wordbooks" you could 
have many additional lists of 3000 words!) 

how it works 

In simplest form, the DIC-TIO-NARY races through 
your document at a 2+ page-per-minute speed. It looks 
at every word in your text. At the same time it compares 
each word with those in its 28,000 wordbook . . . checking 
for any misspelling. When it catches a goof, you get to 
see the word as it was used in your text, on the screen. 
The DIC-TIO-NARY then asks how you want that par- 
ticular word handled. 



extras, extras 

For ease of use, for efficiency and true proofreading 
effectiveness the DIC-TIO-NARY provides you with 
many other useful goodies. You may add or delete in- 
dividual words from the wordbook. . .or do the same 
with an entire list of words. You may have any portion 
of the wordbook listed, and may search it even while 
processing documents. When you add it up, you'll find 
you can't get our total combination of features in any 
other spelling program at any price. 

All in all our DIC-TIO-NARY may well be the most 
valuable and useful program since the little red school- 
house disappeared. Yet, you can enjoy all its benefits 
for only $99.95. If you buy our special Screen Writer 
Professional, you get the $129.95 SCREEN WRITER II 
word processor described on the left, plus The DIC-TIO- 
NARY, at the package price of $199.95. Be creative! Save 
$29.95! 

DIC-TIO-NARY works with Screen Writer II, Super- 
Scribe II, Apple Pie and Apple Writer. Requires 48K 
Apple II or 11+ with DOS 3.3. Available at your local 
computer store or directly from . . .

Cold War. In the small but profitable 
supercomputer market, Cray Research 
and Control Data are far and away the 
leaders. The two companies are based in 
Minneapolis, ten miles apart. 

The similarities do not end here. Un- 
til 1976, Seymour Cray, founder and 
president of Cray Research, worked as a 
computer designer for Control Data. He 
left to start his own company, feeling that 
Control Data wasn't developing super- 
computers fast enough. 

Technically, a supercomputer func- 
tions at a speed of twenty million float- 
ing-point operations per second and is ca- 
pable of handling a range of problems 
that have a database of more than a tril- 
lion words. Only forty-four supercom- 
puters have been installed worldwide; 
thirty-nine are Cray Is and five are Con- 
trol Data Cyber 205s. 

Soon after Cray Research's incep- 
tion, a rivalry developed between the two 
companies that continues to this day. 
Several times in the past five years. Con- 
trol Data has accused Cray Research of 
practicing "one-upmanship." 

Some of the bad feeling between the 
two companies originates from an inci- 
dent that took place a few years ago in 
Manchester, England. After a meeting of 
Control Data's European customers, 
Cray grabbed the potential buyers as 
they were leaving and bused them to a 
different location for a look at Cray's 
supercomputer. 

The Wall Street Journal (May 25, 
1982) reported another Cray maneuver 
that brought howls of displeasure from 
Control Data. Control Data was set to un- 
veil its new line of general-purpose com- 
puters when Cray took the limelight by 
announcing a faster version of its own su- 
percomputer just one day before. 

Although Cray did circulate a brief 
notice at Control Data's customers' 
meeting in Saint Paul, a spokesperson for 
the firm claims their announcement was 
planned for months and wasn't timed to 
embarrass the competition. The brief no- 
tice in question invited the Control Data 
customers over to Cray Research while 
they were in town. 

Cray's unveiling was a big deal for the 
company, apart from any consternation 
it caused at Control Data. Customers and 
the press were taken to Chippewa Falls, 
Wisconsin, for a press conference in a fac- 
tory. This was a first for Cray, and the 
media, including television, showed up in 
force. 

"We think of ourselves as innovative 
and in the forefront of a new technolo- 
gy," says a Cray spokesperson. "We've 



been portrayed as concentrating on the 
competition, which is not really accurate 
and has caused a lot of grief." 

The grief certainly hasn't affected 
Cray's share of the supercomputer mar- 
ket. With more than 80 percent of the su- 
percomputer market, Cray is clearly 
ahead of Control Data, which earns most 
of its money from minis and main- 
frames. Control Data's total sales last 
year were in the billions of dollars ; Cray 
racked up sales of about $100 million. 

Cray is not the only gtiilty party in this 
corporate rivalry. According to the Wall 
Street Journal, Control Data started a 
short-lived rumor that Seymour Cray 
was leaving his company before the Cray 
II supercomputer's projected 1985 com- 
pletion and shipping dates. 

But Cray is not leaving, and the Cray 
II should reach a working prototype 
stage sometime in 1983. Until then, the 
Hatfields and the McCoys will probably 
find something else to bicker over, but 
the business of making computers goes 
on. 

Knock on Any Door. A national sur- 
vey recently conducted by Dunhill Per- 
sonnel System sheds light on the data 
processing job market. The study, 
broken down into the eight top data proc- 
essing fields by area, indicates that com- 
puter processing has weathered the re- 
cession better than any other job mar- 
ket, but the grass isn't as green as it used 
to be. 

There was a time once when pro- 
grammers, programmer analysts, sys- 
tems programmers, and systems ana- 
lysts were treated practically like movie 
stars. Salaries were sky-high, and if you 
didn't like a job there were dozens of 
others to choose from. 

The Dunhill survey says that compa- 
nies hiring data processing personnel 
have grown up. Hiring officials are wiser 
now because they know more about what 
they're looking for. 

Results of the survey for specific mar- 
kets show that oil and gas companies of- 
fer the biggest salaries. A systems pro- 
grammer in these industries averages a 
little more than $35,000 a year. By con- 
trast, a systems programmer in the 
banking industry makes a little less than 
$25,000. A systems analyst working in the 
oil and gas industries makes, on aver- 
age, $30,000 a year, while a systems ana- 
lyst in the insurance business makes a lit- 
tle more than $25,000. 

The low spot on the totem pole is re- 
served for the programmer. On the aver- 
age, programmers make $28,000 a year 
in oil and gas ; both insurance and bank- 



ing programmers make slightly less than 
$20,000. 

When the facts are broken down by 
state, California comes out the overall 
winner. Its lifestyle may be a little crazy, 
but the West Coast offers computer pro- 
fessionals the best money. On the aver- 
age, Cahfomia programmers earn close 
to $25,000 a year, compared to those in 
Massachusetts who 're lucky if they get 
$18,000 annually. 

Monetarily speaking. New York, Illi- 
nois, and Washington, D.C., are the best 
areas after California, although salaries 
vary from job to job. A systems pro- 
grammer in the nation's capital makes a 
fair bundle, but the lowly program- 
mer/analyst could do as well in Texas or 
Michigan. 

Unreal People. They're called "repli- 
cants" in Blade Runner, but don't be 
fooled. The baddies out for Harrison 
Ford's tail in the movie are plainly and 
simply robots. 

Ridley Scott's film is based on the late 
Philip K. Dick's classic science fiction 
novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric 
Sheep? Both the film and the book are 
speculation on what biological humanity 
may have created by the year 2024. In the 
here and now, nothing resembling Dick's 
superhuman replicant is anywhere near 
the design stage. For the moment, hu- 
manoid robots are even more of a pipe 
dream than fusion power. 

"The humanoid robot is to robotics 
what the butterfly is to fljdng. It's an in- 
spirational model," explains Carl Helm- 
ers, editor of Robotics Age. "Needless to 
say, when trying for a butterfly, you may 
end up with a Boeing 747." 

The May /June 1982 issue of the New 
Hampshire-based journal for intelligent 
machine applications and development 
features an informative editorial by 
Helmers on the relationship of com- 
puters and robots. 

He writes: "A robotic engineering de- 
sign which does not take into account 
modern computer design and applica- 
tion is bound for failure. Everything in 
robotics is intimately bound up with the 
use of computers — both as tools of de- 
sign and as structural elements of de- 
signs." 

Later in the editorial, Helmers puts it 
differently: "The new field of robotics 
stands on the shoulders of previous ad- 
vances in the computer field." 

Robotics also stands on the shoulders 
of previous advances in mechanical and 
electrical engineering. But computer 
technology is what makes it all happen, 
supplying the intelligence to guide me-

chanical arms and sensors. 

Computers are also integral to the de- 
sign of intelligent machines. A "pyramid 
of abstractions" illustrates how com- 
puters are used in the development of ro- 
botic systems. 

At the top of the pyramid are soft- 
ware programs where abstract designs 
are born. The abstract design is then 
linked with generalized hardware for 
testing and development in pro- 
grammed simulations. It's still easy to 
change the abstraction at this level be- 
cause the simulation is mostly in the 
computer. 

Once specialized hardware is imple- 
mented, the process becomes less flexi- 
ble, and changing the design could make 
expensive equipment obsolete. 

At the base of the pyramid, the ab- 
stract design finally enters the real world 
of motion systems. "The fact that we will 
ultimately convert some parts of the ab- 
straction pyramid to real hardware is 
what keeps us honest as designers — the 
ultimate test of our simulation is whether 
or not it works in real life," Helmers 
writes. 

Helmers compares operating sys- 
tems, typical software environments, as 
tools of robotic development projects. 
The best system, he says, appears to be 
LISP on special hardware at a cost of ap- 
proximately $50,000, with fifty mega- 
bytes of hard disk storage and 250K of 
main memory. UNIX on a minicom- 



puter runs around $75,000 including ten 
megabjdes of mass storage and 250K of 
main memory. The UCSD pSystem rates 
just behind CP/M; both are relatively 
cheap and require no software engineer- 
ing. 

Helmers believes that soon large ar- 
rays of bubbles and semiconductors will 
replace disks. This will benefit robotics 
and computer science, but like with other 
technological advances, there will be cas- 
ualties. Helmers cites a local New 
Hampshire center for producing preci- 
sion ball bearings that faces the prospect 
of losing a large market. The company 
makes bearings for the spindles found in 
many floppy and hard disk drives. Disk 
manufacturers will obviously be in for 
rough times too. 

The experimental robotics version of 
the old Altair computer kits will appear 
sometime in the next nine months, Helm- 
ers predicts. This should help people 
learn about robotics on their own, just as 
the build- 'em-yourself computers opened 
up the world of amateur computing six 
years ago. 

Robots linked with personal com- 
puters are valuable training tools. An Ap- 
ple or an IBM pc equipped with a rela- 
tively inexpensive robot arm is much 
more accessible to inexperienced opera- 
tors than the big computer systems ac- 
tually used to run most modem robots. 

So where are the androids? Ask your 
local science fiction nut; that's the only 
place you'll find them today — in science 
fiction. 

The majority of real-life robots are 
still in factories, welding and spray paint- 
ing, not quite drinking beer yet or root- 
ing for the surprising Detroit Tigers. 
Some robots are swimming underwater 
like fish, drilling platforms; and some 
are flying at incredible speeds toward the 
edge of the solar system. 

But no robots have stood up on their 
own two feet and taken the first step on 
the long road to becoming humanoid. 

Surviving the Revolution. If you've 
ever been up late at night and had your 
computer hit a bump in the road and lose 
your last hour's worth of writing, you've 
known technological frustration. Com- 
puters are just not that foolproof yet. 
Even personal computers are really im- 
personal; they have total disregard for 
the human being. 

A computer doesn't know who you are 
and doesn't give a hoot about what you're 
up to. It'll accidentally erase data in mem- 
ory whether you're the chief executive of 
the country or a stringer for the Haw- 
thorne Herald. Humans are at fault, we 
know that. After all, we built the darned 
machines. 

The problem is that most people in the 
early stages of the computer revolution 
are unfamiliar with and just a little bit 
scared of computers. With the revolution 
just now hitting stride, the psychological 
effects of computers are becoming the 



subject of increased investigation. 

Thomas McDonald is a psychologist 
with Transition Associates in San Diego, 
California. He's very interested in the 
stresses and strains created by comput- 
ers in the workplace and in the home. But 
he's quick to point out that most people 
seeking psychiatric help suffer from any 
of a million problems. 

"Very rarely, if ever, will someone 
come in and say, 'I'm stressed because of 
my computer. ' But in the last three years 
we've seen ten or twelve people in trou- 
ble, marital or work related, where com- 
puters were a complication. 

"Computers can generate a unique 
set of stresses and strains. If these re- 
main unaddressed, they can create prob- 
lems." 

According to McDonald, few people 
suffering from computer-related stress 
get anywhere near therapy or a psy- 
chologist's office; it's "the tail of an ele- 
phant." McDonald has talked to opera- 
tions managers in local companies, 
which is where you can see all the levels 
of computer-related stress and strain. 

McDonald believes that some of the 
blame rests with vendors who need to of- 
fer more help with the process of intro- 
ducing computers into the work environ- 
ment. By some estimates, more than half 
of the country's businesses will use com- 
puters by 1990. Walking into a situation 
with no computer experience can be very 
scary. 

"You don't have to worry about kids 
so much, because they'll be exposed to 
computers like mother's milk. But the 
great swath of middle America is going 
to find them a whole new thing," McDon- 
ald says. "The workplace has to be com- 
puterized and humanized." 

Computers are machines, and hu- 
mans are not made of the same stuff. We 
don't think logically all the time and 
we're capable of burning out if a situa- 
tion becomes too stressful. The comput- 
er won't burn out (most of the time). 
Stress in humans leads to burnout, which 
leads to turnover, and that is very costly 
to business. 

McDonald defines a revolution as 
something that happens in a very short 
time, can't be predicted, and has a wide 
affect. Any kind of revolution — social, po- 
litical, or technological — causes transi- 
tional stress. Great technical advances 
create pressures of adaptation and cul- 
tural shock. 

Computers will be as pronounced an 
influence in our lives as television and 
cars, which have stress-causing affects 
themselves, but they're much easier to 
use. Many improvements will be needed 
to make computers more friendly and 
foolproof. 

McDonald plans to help keep investi- 
gating the problems of computer stress 
and formulating ways to combat it. We 
should all be thankful that someone is 
bothering to look after our heads. Dl

Everyone's Guide to Assembly 
Language, Part 22 



Last month's column concluded with a demonstration pro- 
gram that showed the relative appearances of a line drawn 
with the normal hplot command as well as with special 140 and 
560 point mode plotting routines. 

The entire plotting process was based on a model of point 
display in which each point on the screen corresponds to the 
status of a particular bit within a memory byte. For general 
plotting, the chart in figure 1 illustrates the corresponding col- 
or points. (For further details, consult recent installments of 
this column.) 

The 140-point mode was created to ensure that for any 
hplot-type action, a consistent color dot would always be plot- 
ted. This consistency is not ordinarily available in the Apple's 
usual 280-point mode. 

For instances in which color is not a concern, an alternate 
scheme was devised that would be indifferent to the color of 
the dot illuminated (as the viewer would when using a black 
and white monitor) . An added feature of this scheme allows 
resolution of points at 560 dots per line. This was done by using 
the high-order bit of each byte to shift a given dot one-half of a 
position. 

When the final demonstration program was run, the last 
line drawn was done in the 560-point mode. You may have no- 
ticed, though, that certain points on the line were rather faint. 
This brings us to the discussion of one of the last ( ? ) bugs in the 
hi-res graphics routines. 

Change last month's test program to appear as follows: 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) 

40 HOME : INPUT "BLACK 1 OR BLACK2? (1 OR 2)";l 
100 REM NORMAL TEST 

110 HGR : HCOLOR= 1*4-4: HPLOT 0,0: CALL 62454: 

HCOLOR= 11-1*4 
120 FOR I = 0 TO 100 
130 HPLOT 1,1 
140 NEXT I 

200 REM PLOT. 140 TEST 

205 PRINT D$;"BLOAD PLOT.140,A$300" 

210 FOR I = 0 TO 100 

220 CALL 768,1,1 

230 NEXT I 

300 REM PLOT. 560 TEST 

305 PRINT D$;"BLOAD PLOT.560,A$300" 

310 FOR I = 0 TO 100 

320 CALL 768,1,1 

330 NEXT I 



When you run this program, enter either a 1 or a 2 to speci- 
fy which "flavor" of black you want for the background. Un- 
der normal circumstances, an hgr statement clears the back- 
ground to blackl, (high bit off on each byte) and plots are done 
using white 1. This program changes that by using the alter- 
nate white for the background selected; that is to say, if you se- 
lect blackl for the background, white2 will be used to plot. If 
you select black2, whitel will be used. 

Examining the listing, then, you'll notice that line 110 sets 
hcolor to blackl or black2, does the required plot, and then 
clears the background to that color. A call 62454 will always 
clear the current hi-res screen to the last color plotted (see 
page 134 of your Applesoft Reference Manual for a description 
of this). 

Following the screen clear, white is set in the alternate 
mode described earlier. 

Lines 100-140 draw a diagonal line point by point as was 
done last column, but now the line should appear to have a few 
faint spots in it. If you choose black2 as the background, the line 
will have places where the dots appear slightly larger than 
you'd have expected. 

Similar effects can be observed in the 140 and 560 mode 
lines. 

Interactions between Adjacent Bytes. The entire premise of 
the 560-point mode was that the high-order bit of each byte af- 
fected the final display position of each bit within it. We have 
seen how changing the status of bit 7 (the high-order bit) may 
shift a given dot one-half of a position, depending on whether or 
not the bit is set. 

Now for the new wrinkle. It turns out that for dots asso- 
ciated with bit 6 of a byte, the high-order bit of the next byte in 
memory also affects the display of the first byte. 

As an example, first clear the hi-res screen with an hgr and 
then enter the Monitor via the usual call— 151. 

Now enter the following values into memory. You should 
see an effect similar to the description at the right of each 
statement. 



*2138: 40 (plots dot. Width = 1 unit) 

*2139: 80 (dot extends. New width = 1.5 units) 

*2139; 00 (back to normal. Width = 1 unit) 

*2138: CO (faint. Width = 0.5 units) 

*2139: 80 (normal. Width = 1 unit)

* HI-RES PLOT. 140+ * 



Figure 2. 



The references to a width are an approach to explaining 
what happens. If you have a black and white monitor, the rela- 
tive visual strengths of the dots can be related to an apparent 
width of the dots when illuminated on the monitor screen. On a 
color television or monitor, the widths aren't discernible, but 
differences in color and brightness can be seen. 

Before any further explanations, let's re-examine the 560- 
point model used in earlier columns. 

You'll recall that although the violet and blue dots officially 
occupy the same screen position horizontally, in actuality a 
half position shift may happen, depending on whether the high 
bit is set or clear. When $2138 was set to $40, we were, as such, 
plotting position 12 on the display. When $2138 was set to $CX), 
position 13 was illuminated. The flaw can be explained by 
imagining that the high-order bit of $2139 (the next byte after 
$2138) can also produce a slight shift on a dot produced by bit 6 
of $2138. The general rule is that for any dot produced by bit 6, 
the succeeding bj^e of memory must have a high-order bit (bit 
7) set to the same value as bit 7 of the byte being plotted. 

If this rule is not observed, one of two things will happen: 

1. If bit 7 of the displayed byte is clear and the next byte is 
set, the dot will be extended or enlarged — slightly. 

2. If bit 7 of the displayed byte is set and the next bjrte is 
clear, the dot will be reduced slightly, resulting in a faint- 
er image. 

An interesting result is the conclusion that even the "nor- 
mal" method of plotting (that is, white) will give ragged dis- 
plays when adjacent bytes have contrary high-bit settings! 

Some "New and Improved" Routines. Well then, that has 
been a lot to digest. In fact, at this point you might just want to 
take a break to let everything sink in, maybe fix yourself a nice 
cup of tea and meditate on it for a while. 

Glad to see you again ! One of the difficulties in presenting 
the material in the last few issues has resulted from the dis- 
covery that hi-res graphics is not all that logical. Much of hi-res 
graphics seems to be very empirical in nature. That is, it's 
more a matter of accepting that things are a certain way as de- 
rived from experimentation, than trying to account for the in- 
nermost workings of a seemingly random event. (In this case, 
the innermost workings are related to the purely electronic 
world of wires, video protocols, and so forth, which is mostly 
incidental to the programmer!) 

The worst is probably over, though. At this point you should 
have at least a general feel of how the dots are mapped on the 
screen. Let's now create some final routines that encompass 
the various quirks of the hi-res system as it presently exists : 

PLOT.140-I-. The first one to fix is the 140-point mode rou- 
tine. For all routines the approach will be very direct: 

1. Determine whether the dot being plotted involves bit 6 of 
the byte of memory in question. If not, don't worry. 

2. If bit 6 is used, check the status of the high-order bit (bit 
7) of the byte. 

3. Fix the high-order bit of the next byte in memory, if 
needed, to match the first byte.

Here's the new routine to do just that: 



%01111111 
ALWAYS 
% 10000000 



The listing through line 47 should appear identical to last 
month's routine. Lines 48 through 62 add a check to see wheth- 
er the next byte in memory needs to be adjusted according to 
the three-step procedure just described. 

The first step is to examine location $30 (HMASK) . You'll 
remember from last month that this is a mask used to indicate 
which bit position is to be set to plot the point. If bit 6 were set, 
this location will hold the value $CXI (binary: %11000000) . Lines 
49 through 51 check for this. 

If a match is found, we know bit 6 was set by the plot. We 
must now access the next byte in memory and either set or 
clear bit 7 of that to match our original byte. Since HNDX 
($E5) holds the offset of the current byte (usually used by com- 
bining with GBAS ($26) in the form LDA (GBAS,Y), we can 
load the Y register with HNDX and then increment using the 



108 



# \oi:tai If 



JULY 1982 



INY on line 54 to shift our attention to the next byte. The data 
for that byte is then loaded into the accumulator on line 55. 

Now for the sleight of hand. We want to check the status of 
the first byte, but if we load the accumulator we'll lose the data 
currently held there. To solve the problem, consider this: The 
color mask byte COLBYTE ($E4) holds the mask used only 
moments before to do the plot. We can check the high-order bit 
of this value to determine the status of bit 6 in the byte ac- 
cessed by the plot. Since it's bit 7 we're interested in, we can 
also use the BIT command to do the check. 

Line 56 does a BIT COLBYTE. This will move bit 7 of COL- 
BYTE into the status register, after which a BMI (branch on 
minus) or a BPL (branch on plus) can be used to check how 
the bit was set. 

In this case, the BMI is used to detect bit 7 being set. If this 
branch is taken, the program will skip to line 60. If not, the 
HICLR (for high-bit clear) section will be entered. In this sec- 
tion, the AND operator is used to force the clearing of the high 
bit in the accumulator. The BPL following this operation is al- 
ways taken as the sign bit of the status register and will be 
cleared by this action as well. 

If HISET (for high-bit set) is entered, the ORA #$80 will 
force the setting of bit 7 of the accumulator. (If you need more 
information on the logical operators, you may wish to consult 
back issues of this column or chapter eleven of Assembly 
Lines: The Book.) Line 61 (STORE) puts the contents of the ac- 
cumulator back into memory, immediately followed by the 
RTS which ends the routine. 

PLOT .560-1-. This routine is also a variation on a program 
presented last month and again uses a check system identical 
to that used in PLOT.140.

Ordinarily, this would be a fine place to end this month's 
column, but there's one more routine worth presenting. So far 
what you've got is a choice between plotting a single color 
(PLOT.140) or taking whatever color you get in exchange for 
the capability for greater horizontal resolution. 

Well, with just a little more effort, we can create a routine 
that will offer the same degree of horizontal accuracy, and 
gtiarantee that any dot plotted will be white. 

PLOT.560-Whlte. Normally when you specify white when 
using Apple graphics, you're really saying, "I don't care what 
color," because any attempt to plot a single point will illu- 
minate only a colored dot, not a true white dot. This is because 
white is really formed by plotting two adjacent dots. 

This is consistent with the examination of the COLBYTE bit 
pattern for acceptable bits to set combined with the given 
HMASK bit pattern for a specified horizontal position within 
the byte. This process of plotting was described in greater de- 
tail last month, but as a quick refresher, remember that this 
combination would successfully do the equivalent of: 



Statement: HCOLOR = 3:HPLOT 3,0 
Mask Patterns: COLBYTE: %01 1 1 
HMASK: %1000 
RESULT: %0000 



1111 (HCOLOR BIT MASK) 
1000 (BIT 3 SET) (ignore HI bit) 
1000 (Position 3 gets set green) 



JULY 1982 



U ) F T A L K » 



109 



You might imagine that if the HMASK could have been set 
up to have two adjacent bits set, the result might have been a 
true white dot: 



Statement: HCOLOR = 3:HPLOT 3,0 
Mosk Patterns: COLBYTE: %01 1 1 
HMASK: %1001 
RESULT: %0001 



1111 (HCOLOR BIT MASK) 

1000 (BITS3&4SET) 

1000 (Positions 3 & 4 set white) 



As it happens, this can be done, and here's the new routine 
to do it!

This routine starts out much like the other PLOT. 560 rou- 
tine. Lines 24 through 44 are identical and perform the same 
function of calculating what X value to hand to the normal 
Applesoft routine. The first difference appears at line 50, 
where a JSR HPOSN is performed instead of a JSR HPLOT. 
This is done to allow Applesoft to go through its usual prep- 
aration for a plot. This sets up the color mask and position 
mask bytes and also the base address calculation. 

At this point, we step into the usual process to tamper 
with the HMASK ($30) value. As in the earlier example, this 
would ordinarily have just a single bit position "marked" 
for the upcoming PLOT. However, by using the ASL, ORA 
HMASK combination on lines 47 and 48, we can shift the 
original pattern and then superimpose the new pattern on 
the old. 

Example: For X = 3 
Original HMASK: %1000 1000 

ASL: %0001 0000 

ORA HMASK: %1001 1000 

The address usually given for the HPLOT routine, $F457, 
includes a JSR to HPOSN. Because we've already done this, 
a JSR HPLOT+3 accomplishes the first stage of our opera-

tion; namely, the plotting of a pure white dot. 

Now the remaining problem is to take care of end-of-the- 
byte flaws. This can occur for four possible plots. For each 
byte, there are fourteen possible positions which can be 
plotted, numbered 0 through 13 (see figure 2). For positions 
10 and 11, bits 5 and 6 will be set. Because bit 6 can be af- 
fected by bit 7 of the next byte in memory, a check for bit 
agreement must be made. 

Stranger still, if positions 12 and 13 are plotted, only bit 6 
is available, which would normally put us back to having 
plotted only a colored dot. To fix this, we have to go again to 
the next byte in memory and do another plot to illuminate 
just the very first dot of that byte. 

In general then, the process will be: 

1. Fix HMASK to turn on two adjacent bits where 
possible. 

2. HPLOT with altered HMASK. 

3. Check for bit 6 usage. If none, exit routine. 

4. Set bit 7 of next byte to ag^ee with bit 7 of current byte. 

5. Check whether bit 5 is being used. If not, go directly to 
HPLOT+3. 

6. If bit 5 is set, set HMASK to plot only the first dot of the 
next hyte. 

7. Make a second pass to HPLOT to plot X+l screen coor- 
dinate, single dot only. If HMASK set to $81, only the 
high-order bit will be set, with no actual plot done. 

If you now examine line 52 of the listing, you'll see the 
BIT command is again used, this time to check bit 6 of 
HMASK. The BIT command forces bit 6 of the status reg- 
ister (the overflow flag) to the same value as bit 6 of 
HMASK. Thus BVS (branch overflow set) and BVC (branch 
overflow clear) can be used to check for bit 6 set or clear, 
respectively. In our case, BVC will branch to the exit point, 
DONE, if bit 6 is clear. 

If bit 6 is set, lines 57-63 set the high bit of the other color 
mask byte, HCOLOR ($1C) , to agree with the previous plot. 
This color mask byte is used later by HPLOT. Because we'll 
be skipping the usual entry point ($F457) , we have to set this 
byte specifically. 

Once the color byte is set, another check is done to see if 
bit 5 is set. This is done by again using the BIT command. 
Since only bits 6 and 7 can be checked via the status regis- 
ter, we must load the accumulator with a numeric image of 
the bit we wish to test for. In this case, the value used is #$20 
(%00100000). After the BIT command, a BNE (branch not 
equal) will be taken if bit 5 is set. Yes, it sounds backward, 
but then BIT is a rather strange command. 

Given the appropriate result of the BIT test, HMASK is 
loaded with either #$81 or #$80, depending on whether we want 
an actual plot to take place. 

At line 78 (FIX) , we take advantage of the fact that the Y 
register is still set to the right value to access the current 
memory byte. By doing the INY, we advance the pointer to 
the next byte so that the JSR HPLOT -1-3 will make the ap- 
propriate corrections to the next byte in memory. 

A Final Demo Program. To finish things off, let's try one 
last Applesoft program to make use of the new routines. 
This is an extension of the first listing presented at the be- 
ginning of this article, and will give you an opportunity to 
compare the relative screen appearances of different rou- 
tines.

965 IF F THEN CALL 768,X,Y 
970 NEXT I 
980 RETURN 

You'll also notice that this has the scaling factors built 
into it to make each line slant at the same angle. The offset 
factor K is used to move each plot to the right a little for ap- 
pearance's sake. 

By adding line 955 like so: 

955 X = X/2 

You can slant the lines even further to show off the maxi- 
mum slant possible for the 560-point modes. You might also 
want to try this program with the 140 and 560 point routines 
from last issue to see how they perform in place of the new 
ones. 

Parting Remarks. These routines are best used in 
mathematical charts, rather than in pure graphics such as 
pictures. The main argument against the 560-point mode is 
that you can't be assured that plotting one point will not af- 
fect nearby points. As we've demonstrated here, there is ap- 
parently no approach that can guarantee this will not hap- 
pen. It would seem, then, a matter of your own preference 
which to use. Our hope is that these routines will widen your 
options for your own programming goals and that they've 
taught you a little along the way. 

The usual approach in this column has been to simplify 
any idea when first presenting it. In the area of graphics, 
though, simplicity has not been easy. For the most part, hi- 
res graphics gives the impression of being only marginally 
logical. In any event, though, now you're probably starting 
to get a feel for how the contents of memory affect what is 
displayed on the screen. In the final analysis, the real chal- 
lenge of hi-res graphics is manipulating the contents of 
memory to produce the visual effects you want. 

Well, enough of the computer-side chat. Have fun with 
the routines and see you here next issue! 

Correction to the March 1982 Assembly Lines: You may 
have had difficulty with the HI-RES DEMO - #1. The problem 
lies in line #84 of the listing. The listing should read: 

6077: 20 05 F6 84 JSR DRAW 4-4 

The DRAW routine ($F601) is normally called with the X 
and Y registers set to the address of the individual shape to 
be drawn. This can be automated, however, by first calling 
SHNUM ($F730) . When SHNUM is called though, a later en- 
try point to DRAW is used. Specifically, this should be 
DRAW 4-4 ($F605). Entering at $F601 by mistake can pro- 
duce rather unpredictable results. 

Thanks to Don Munyan of Santa Fe Springs, California, 
for writing about this error in the listing.

□ Apple Computer (Cupertino, CA), 
with the aid of the San Jose Police De- 
partment, has concluded a "sting" op- 
eration resulting in the recovery of 
$1,068,500 worth of stolen Apple Ills and 
the arrest and dismissal of four em- 
ployees. Officials became suspicious sev- 
eral months ago when inventory started 
showing losses of one and two units at a 
time over a period of months. An under- 
cover agent was placed in the company, 
and police conducted a raid the week of 
May 11 on the warehouse where the Ills 
were being stored. 

□ Muse Software (Baltimore, MD) is out 
of the hardware business. The decision to 
leave retailing and return to software re- 
search and development, lajdng off ten 
employees, was made by president Ed 
Zaron, who said the Charles Street store 
was breaking even but required more 
energy than it was worth. 

"It was a matter of deciding where to 
focus our energies. We decided to con- 
tinue to do what we do best, and that is 
write programs." 

□ Spinnaker Software (Cambridge, MA) 
has been founded by Bill Bowman and 
David Seuss "to fill the need for quality 
software in home education." Funded by 
TA Associates, the new company is look- 
ing for educational software program- 
mers who want a marketing outlet for 
their efforts. They will release their first 
series of ten educational games and in- 
teractive fiction programs in late August. 

□ The new mail-order software division 
of dillthlum Press (Beaverton, OR) will 
not be called Blackbird Software, as re- 
•ported in Marketalk News in May. In the 
interests of easy user identification, the 
division will now be known as dillthlum 
Software. 

n Mary Locke is the new customer rep- 
resentative for Penguin Software (Ge- 
neva, IL) . According to president Mark 
Pelczarskl, she will be handling all cus- 
tomer service as well as deciding wheth- 
er it would help, when caught in a falling 
elevator, to jump just before it hits the 
ground. 

□ Jon Freeman and Anne Westfall have 
formed Free Fall Associates, a micro- 
computer game design and development 
firm located in Palo Alto, California. 
Freeman is the cofounder of Automated 
Simulations and designer of the Dunjon- 
quest system, among others. Westfall 
was senior software engineer with Auto- 
mated, previously having worked to es- 
tablish the microcomputer products and 
development division at Morton Tech- 
nologies. 

□ Software Marketing Incorporated 



(Cambridge, MA) is a new company 
formed to provide marketing expertise to 
software producers contemplating the in- 
troduction of a new product. 

Stated president Mort Rosenthal, "We 
feel that, despite the plethora of software 
available, there is a distinct lack of well- 
marketed software products." 

SMI will assist small software com- 
panies in obtaining financing, and con- 
sult with them on market planning and 
research, promotion coordination, de- 
sign and packaging, establishment of a 
distribution system, and assessment of fi- 
nancial resources. Services will vary de- 
pending on requirements and resources 
of the client.

ware (Atlanta, GA) , has announced that 
Peachtree has reached an agreement in 
principle with Automation Consultants to 
license its CP/M Job Cost System soft- 
ware package. 

"Job costing is a package in great de- 
mand by our customers," said Dyer. 
"This system will enable microcomput- 
er users to quickly pinpoint their most 
profitable jobs while at the same time 
immediately highlighting unprofitable 
areas. 

"This . . . also represents an impor- 
tant milestone for Peachtree 's new West 
Coast office, which is located in the San 
Francisco Bay Area. Increased software 
acquisitions are one of the major func- 
tions of our West Coast operation." 

The company's overseas arm has ac- 
quired marketing rights to COMPACCT,

ing packages by CSA Micro Systems Ltd. 
of London. 

□ Management Science America (At- 
lanta, GA), parent company of Peach- 
tree Software, has filed a registration 
statement with the Securities and Ex- 
change Commission in connection with a 
proposed public offering of 710,000 shares 
of common stock: 250,000 shares to be 
sold by the company, and 460,000 shares 
sold by certain shareholders. Proceeds to 
the company will be used to furnish work- 
ing capital and provide capital for possi- 
ble acquisitions of companies, products, 
and equipment. 

The company has reported first quar- 
ter earnings of $16.2 million, up 47 per- 
cent from the first quarter of 1981. 

□ Contending that computer retailing re- 
lies on "horse and buggy methods for 
selling space-age technology," Philip 
Rozensky, president of Simple Soft (Elk 
Grove, IL), has devised a five-minute 
"infomercial" for a new real estate 
analysis package his firm recently re- 
leased. The purpose of the new market- 
ing approach, consisting of a videotape 
information/sales presentation, is to aid 
retail sales, train new salespeople, and 
serve as a method of teaching computer 
technology.

□ Soft-Link (Los Altos, CA) has been 
founded by Held Rutherford, Gary Al- 
mond, and Joe D. Giulle to develop, pro- 
duce, and market business software. It 
has introduced tliirteen CP/M-based pro- 
grams, encrypted with a process called 
Soft-Lok, available to the user on a trial 
basis. If satisfied with the program, the 
user arranges to pay the balance of the 
purchase price and receive the key code 



which unlocks the program encryption. 
The programs are being distributed by 
Ico- Rally. 

"Soft-Link expects to be a strong par- 
ticipant in the software business witliin 
six months," said Rutherford. "The busi- 
ness market will easily reach $3 billion by 
1985. The industry's only limitation is its 
ability to sell the best software available 
in a cost-effective manner. Soft-Link's 
trial-use software is a major step in that 
direction." 

□ Vlsi-Group (Scarsdale, NY), the larg- 
est independent user group specializing 
in the uses of VisiCalc-type programs 
and publishers of Spreadsheet, a bi- 
monthly newsletter, have changed their 
name to Inter-Calc, reasoning that the 
value of the group to members in cover-

VENTURES Wrra VISICALC 

BY IOC mroii 



Once you've used VisiCalc, you realize you have a perfect 
method of analyzing and generating lots of numeric informa- 
tion. But, after you've spent a few minutes looking at long 
columns of numbers, you also realize the near impossibility of 
understanding what those numbers mean. 

Look at a tax table. Do the tax percentages increase or de- 
crease in proportion to gross income? It may look as though 
they always increase, but are there minor trends? You could 
use VisiCalc to analyze the information, but there's an easier 
way: graphics. It's much simpler to understand data trends in 
graphic format than in numeric format. 

A number of business graphics products designed to con- 
vert and display data from VisiCalc files are available to 
Apple users. This month, we'll examine Apple II Business 
Graphics, Apple III Business Graphics, VisiTrend/VisiPlot, 
and Apple Plot. All of them can help you analyze numerical in- 
formation. First, we'll give you a synopsis of each program's 
intent. Then we'll offer an evaluation of how well the pro- 
grams work. 

Recently introduced by Apple Computer, Business Graph- 
ics for the Apple II and Business Graphics for the III combine 
the ability to develop many different plots with statistical and 
analytical capabilities. They also allow numerical manipula- 
tion and additional analysis of numeric data. 

Both programs were developed for Apple Computer by 
Business and Professional Software (Cambridge, MA). The II 
version, which requires 48K, language card, and two disk 
drives, and the in program, which calls for 128K and external 
disk drive, are very similar. Both are command- language 
driven. With a command language, you enter a simple two or 
three word English language command and the program exe- 
cutes it. This is a far cry from programs that require under- 
standing menu structiires and entering menu options to ac- 
complish your goal. 

Pies for Sale. Both programs are capable of plotting scat- 
tergrams; solid-line, dashed-line, area-flUed, bar (vertical or 
horizontal, filled or outline), multibar, and pie (filled or out- 
line) charts; and multiple overlays. 

Here then are some of the features in both Apple business 
graphics products: 

The format for the commands is verb noun modifier. You 
aren't required to use a modifier in every command. Some ex- 
amples of commands are draw pie and set device silentype. 
Once you become familiar with the commands, you'll be able 
to abbreviate them to the first two or three letters, depending 
upon the command. For example, draw pie can be abbrevi- 
ated to dr pi. 

Both programs can compute and plot line, logarithmic, con- 
stant, sine, and parabola curves. You can also use them for 
doing statistical analysis; they compute minimum, mean, 
maximum, standard deviation, sum, and variance. You can 
perform, mathematical manipulation of data sets, including 
adding sets, shifting, difference, subtracting, dividing, sum- 
ming, and multiplying. 

Both programs are compatible with Silentype and Qume 
Sprint 5 printers, Hewlett-Packard 7225a/b (with 17603A, RS- 
232 personality mode), and Houston Instruments DMP-3 and 
DMP-4 pen plotters. 

Data interchange involves converting files from other ap- 
plications so that they can be plotted. Apple III Business 
Graphics converts VisiCalc III print files and DIF format, Ap- 
ple III Business Basic, and Apple III Pascal text files. Apple II 
Business Graphics works on VisiCalc (thirteen and sixteen sec- 



tor) print files and Apple Plot (thirteen and sixteen sector) , 
DIF format, Basic (thirteen and sixteen sector), and Apple 
Pascal text files. 

Both programs display six colors on color television sets or 
monitors and plot color graphs on pen plotters. 

Virtually Leapfrogging. Business Graphics can use data 
files larger than the available computer memory. Default file 
size is ninety to one hundred points, but you can set a virtual 
file on a disk, allowing a file to contain thousands of points. 

A series of Business Graphics commands, as well as special 
take file commands, can be stored in a special file executed by 
a single command. This is useful if you want to make graphic 
comparisons of large amounts of information. You can dis- 
play any number of slides (graphs) sequentially with either 
automatic timing or manual control. 

Business Graphics permits a user to learn enough about the 
program to become productive and develop plots in a short 
time. Command language is the most obvious difference be- 
tween Business Graphics and other graphics programs. 

Depending upon the user, the command language may be 
experienced as a boon or a potential problem. While the com- 
mand langxiage is simple to use, it requires that the user un- 
derstand it and know the commands to accomplish more com- 
plicated tasks. The sequence of commands necessary for some 
complicated plots can be very complex. Help screens are 
available, though, so you don't always have to refer to a man-

ual for answers to your questions. The take files are also use- 
ful because they animate the process. 

Device-independent programs such as these are powerful 
enough to use the capabilities of extremely hi-res printers and 
plotters. This means Business Graphics can expand to meet 
your needs. As you need higher resolution plots, you have only 
to purchase a better printer or plotter and a driver. 

Power Trio. Three features make the Business Graphics 
packages powerful tools for analyzing and presenting numeric 
information. The virtual file capability allows you to enter 
large amounts of data into a single file. You can then select any 
segment of the information and display it. For example, you 
might have three years of daily sales information in a single 
file. Select any segment, one month's sales for example, and 
then display it. 

The statistical functions permit fitting one of five curves into 
a data set and projecting it into the future. This can be used for 
sales and other types of projections. Projection and analysis 
are much easier in Business Graphics than in VisiCalc, be- 
cause you don't have to enter your own formulas. 

Take files are another useful feature. They constitute a 
miniprogramming language that uses all of the Business 
Graphics commands, along with a few others. Take files make 
it possible for you to automate plots on a plotter, do slide pre- 
sentations, automate updating of files, and so on. 

VisiPlot and VisiTrend/VisiPlot, from VisiCorp (the Visi- 
Calc people), are among the best selling business products 
around. VisiTrend/VisiPlot is a combination business graphics 
and statistical product. VisiTrend is a subset of VisiTrend/ 
VisiPlot for those who don't require statistical capability. 

These products are designed to run on a sixteen-sector Ap- 
ple II or II Plus with 48K (with or without language card) and 
one disk drive. Both packages are capable of plotting line, 
area, bar, pie, and high/low charts and scattergrams. 

The products are menu driven, using an unusual type of 
menu that displays the options in two horizontal rows and uses

an inverse box (similar to the cell cursor on VisiCalc) . A Visi- 
Calc user will find the menus simple to use. 

Multiple series can be plotted. Windowing (similar to Visi- 
Calc) allows simultaneous plotting of two different graphs. Up 
to sixteen different data series, with a total of 645 points, can be 
in memory at one time, and a single chart can contain up to 160 
points. 

VisiTrend can determine simple statistics such as mean, 
average, minimum, and maximum. It can also do moving 
averages, linear multiple regression, trend-line forecasting, 
cumulative, total, lead, lag, percent change, and smoothing. It 
permits, too, complex arithmetic operations on two or more 
time series. 

These Visi products are compatible with the following 
printers: Apple Sllentype, Trendcom 200, Centronics 739, NEC 
Spinwriter 5510, 5520, and 5530; Qume Sprint 5/45, Epson MX-

Tiger 440, 445, 460/460G (both must include dotplot option) , and 
560/560G (dotplot option) . 

Thumbnail Review. Like the rest of the Vlsl series, these 
are quality products. They offer some features that none of the 
other products reviewed here have, namely, they allow you 
more than two data sets in memory and give you the ability to 
display two separate graphs at the same time. For some users, 
these features alone could justify their purchase. 

A big plus is that the DIF format permits data to be easily 
transferred between many of the Visi products. If you need Visi- 
Calc, VisiFile, or VisiDex, this may be important. The Vlsl 
graphics products, unlike Apple products, don't need a con- 
version file to convert data; it stays in DIF file format. 

In addition, you probably won't have to return to your 
dealer to have the program reconfig^ed for different printers. 
It already supports more than thirteen printers. 

The Visi products can plot almost everything the Apple pro- 
ducts can, as well as offering a high/low graph capability. 
High/low is especially useful to stock market analysts and per- 
sons who need to compare two values on a single point. 

The unusual menu format can take a little adjusting to, but 
it soon becomes easy. You can plot without pressing any keys 
other than the arrow and return. 

Apple Plot, a two-year-old program, was originally de- 
signed for business people and professionals but also proved 
popular in schools and homes. The first Of Apple's business 
graphics products, Apple Plot was designed to run on an Ap- 
ple II with 48K and one disk drive. 

Apple Plot plots the most common graphs: scatter, line, 
bar, and multibar charts (two bars per points) . 

It allows two data sets to be in memory with up to one hun- 
dred points. Multiple overlays are possible, allowing many dif- 
ferent plots to be displayed. Apple Plot is compatible with the 
Sllentype and Qume Sprint 5 printers. 

A VisiCalc file converter program on the Apple Plot disk 
permits conversion of VisiCalc DIF files. Slide Show, another 
program on the Apple Plot disk, lets you display a number of 
plots in a slide show format. 

Apple Plot displays all of the Apple II colors but can only 
plot black and white copies on a printer. 

The Simple Life. Apple Plot has aged well but is now over- 
shadowed by more sophisticated products. It's easy to use ; in 
fact, it can be used almost without referring to the manual. 
Menu selection is also straightforward, but there are some- 
times too many submenus. 

Apple Plot has one glaring weakness: it only prints on 
Apple's Sllentype and the Qume (or any Qume-compatible 
printer) . The Qume, however, is not an ideal printer for plot- 
ting graphs. Anyone with another type of printer or plotter is 
probably out of luck. 

Like any business graphics prog^ram, Apple Plot also has a 
VisiCalc conversion program. The actual conversion program 
is not particularly direct. You have to read the manual for this 
one, but it can provide an inexpensive method of plotting Visi- 
Calc data. 

Another minor weakness is that this is a thirteen-sector 
DOS program. Apple Computer no longer sells thirteen-sector

'Qood order is the foundation 
ofadgoodtfiings!' 

EDMUND BURKE 




WHAT IS 
basic? 

basic' IS a completely structured 
extension of the BASIC language designed 
to assist the serious programmer in the writing 
and debugging of new computer programs. It 
IS a set of tools that facilitate the development 
of well-structured code which is easy to read 
and maintain. 

Blocks of code are indicated by a unique 
indentation convention, eliminating the need for 
extraneous statements (such as BEGIN, END) 
and line numbers. 

basic' control statements are simple, but 
powerful and complete, and include the usual 
IF. ELSE and FOR. Added statements are REPEAT/ 
UNTIL, PROC/DO, and CASE. The UNTIL state- 
ment IS very powerful since it can occur anywhere 
in a REPEAT block — beginning, middle or end 
UNTIL can also appear in a FOR block. The 
CASE statement can work with any expression — 
string or numeric. ELSE can also be used with 
CASE as an "everything else" condition. PROC 
and DO permit the defining and invoking of 
named subroutines. The listing below graphically 
illustrates the difference between basic' and 
BASIC. 



I 

basic' VS. 

BASIC & PASCAL 

A basic' program is logically simpler 
n Its BASIC counterpart. Its logic 
IS easily apparent to anyone reading 
It. Even large and complex programs 
remain readable and maintainable. 
PASCAL IS a very good, if somewhat wordy 
structured language. However, PASCALS great 
disadvantage lies not in the language itself, but 
in Its microcomputer implementation PASCAL is 
compiled, and compilers are fine for producing 
faster-running (although larger) programs. 
Compilers are deficient, however, in the area 
of program debugging. On the other hand, 
interpreters excel in debugging since they allow 
the programmer to query the state of the program 
after a bug has occurred. Professional program- 
mers know that the bulk of software develop- 
ment time IS spent debugging code Since time 
can mean money, an efficient debugging environ- 
ment IS critical. 

basic' uses the BASIC interpreter already 
available on your own microcomputer for efficient 
debugging. If faster execution is required, a basic' 
program can later be compiled by an available 
BASIC compiler— but only after it is debugged 
and running.

HOW DOES basic' WORK? 
A basic' program is written via editor^, a full- 
function text file editor optimized for program- 
ming, and IS then processed, or translated into 
a normal BASIC program. 

editor' recognizes the basic' control state- 
ments and automatically indents the text to the 
appropriate level. The editor' display always 
reflects the current state of the program text 
The listings produced by the processor (see below) 
are exceptionally well-ordered. Comments are 
automatically right justified for ease of reading, 
block indentation reveals the flow of control, 
procedures are separated by white spaces, and 
an extensive cross-reference is provided. Once 
the translation is produced, debugging can take 
place using the existing BASIC interpreter When 
bugs are detected, patches can be applied to 
the translation. It is usually possible to correct 
from 5 to 10 bugs in translations before having 
to reprocess the basic' source program 
HOW CAN I GET IT? 

basic' IS now available for the APPLE. TRS/80 
and IBM PERSONAL COMPUTER. Inquire at your 
local computer dealer or order direct using the

disk drives, but continues to sell thlrteen-sector products. Of 
course, since the disk can easily be converted to DOS 3.3 using 
Muffin on the DOS 3.3 master disk, this is not an insurmount- 
able problem. 

How Do They Compare? Apple Plot operates from a stand- 
ard menu, VisiTrend/VisiPlot operates from a different type of 
menu, and both Business Graphics programs are command- 
language driven. 

In normal operation, each program has advantages and 
disadvantages. VisiTrend/VisiPlot is slow changing from 
Trend to Plot, and the menu options aren't always apparent. 
Business Graphics has constant program disk access and the 
command language has the potential to be confusing. Apple 
Plot requires a simple but sometimes confusing data entry 
section. Each product can seem extremely simple — or ex- 
tremely frustrating. But you can learn any of them rapidly. 

The Apple business graphics packages, the Vlsi packages, 
and Apple Plot all have good manuals, and both Business 
Graphics and VisiTrend/VisiPlot offer reference cards. The 
Visi reference card is the best. 

Apple Plot requires that you scale the axis and set up the 
parameters of a plot; the others do it automatically. All allow 
changing the scale. 

All the products outlined here allow floating titles (titles you 
can put wherever you want) . Apple Plot allows only two such 
titles, but VisiPlot and Business Graphics allow as many as 
you want. 

Each plots the standard graph types: scatter, line, and bar. 
VisiPlot and Apple Plot permit only two bars side by side. 
Business Graphics permits up to five side-by-side bars. 

VisiPlot handles sixteen different series in memory simul- 
taneously, Apple Plot allows two, while Business Graphics al- 
lows only one. Both Business Graphics and Apple Plot allow 
you to overlay other data sets for multiple plots. 

PYom an available file size standpoint, Business Graphics 
has virtual file, VisiPlot 150 points, and Apple Plot 100 points. 

All of these products can display VisiCalc data. Business 



Graphics can plot data from other applications, and Visi- 
Trend/VisiPlot (using DIF) can swap flies with other VisI 
series products. 

VisiPlot has the best initial printer selection. Depending on 
printer or plotter driver availability, Business Graphics Is 
compatible with a large number of printers. Apple Plot Is com- 
patible with only two. 

Apple Plot has no statistical capabilities. The other prod- 
ucts all have roughly similar statistical capabilities. 

Business Graphics has take files, and Apple Plot presents a 
slide show. 

Which Should You Buy? For two of these products, there's a 
simple answer to this question. If you have an Apple III and 
want a graphics product that takes advantage of the Apple 
Ill's features, Apple III Business Graphics Is your answer. You 
could use the Vlsi series products or Apple Plot In emulation 
mode on the III, but they might not provide you with all of the 
capabilities you'd have on an Apple II — and they would use 
none of the Apple III features. 

If you are looking for an inexpensive, easy-to-use business 
graphics product for use with either the Qume or the SUentype 
printers, Apple Plot is clearly the solution. 

When it comes to VisiPlot, VisiTrend/VisiPlot, a.nd Apple II 
Business Graphics, the choice Is not so simple. Here is a recap 
of factors likely to Influence your choice: 

VisiPlot has no statistical capabilities. VisiPlot/VisiTrend 
and Apple II Business Graphics are almost evenly matched. 
Some major price differences make the Apple product appear 
a bargain, provided you already have the two disk drives that 
Apple Business Graphics reqiilres. Beyond that, the choice 
boils down to some specific differences. If you need a plotter, 
Apple II Business Graphics is your answer. If you need simple 
interchange with VisiCalc and the other Visi products or the 
ability to display two or more plots and to do high/low plots, 
the answer is VisiTrend/VisiPlot. 

Your best bet is to go to your dealer and try them all. You'll 
like them. JM

Proven tools for programmers. 
From Microsoft. 



Old friends. Eight years ago, Microsoft put BASIC 
on the first microcomputer. Today, there are more 
than 1,000,000 copies of Microsoft^ 
languages in use. BASIC interpreter. 
BASIC compiler. FORTRAN, and 
COBOL. A proven set of program- 
ming tools. All, fully supported 
by Microsoft. 

The best get better. Good 
tools work better if you keep 
them sharp. That's why we 
constantly improve the tools we 
offer. Enhancing them. Increasing 
their utility. Taking full advantage 
of the strengths of each language 
Supporting you, the user, with 
a full range of finely honed 
programming tools. 

Technical support. When you buy 
our tools, you get our number If you 
have technical problems, call the Microsoft 
support staff for assistance. If we don't have the 
answers now, we'll find them and call you back. 

Compatible documentation. All Microsoft 
languages share a common approach to documen- 
tation. Starting with plain English. That means 
that even when you're learning a new language, 
you won't have to learn a new vocabulary. 

Linkable code. All Microsoft compilers share 
common utilities. A linker accompanies each 




compiler. That means you can write programs in 
two or more languages, taking advantage of 

the specific strengths of each, then, link and 
run them as a single program. 

Leadership in micros. Nobody 
gave us leadership. We earned it 
through innovation, enhanced 
programming tools and complete 
user support. Today Microsoft is the 
only software supplier to offer you 
a complete programming environ- 
ment. Including specialized languages 
that support you in a wide variety of 
programming situations. Tomorrow, you can 
look to Microsoft to make that environment 
even more productive. 

Better tools. Ask your Microsoft dealer 
about Microsoft's family of proven tools 
for programmers: BASIC interpreter, BASIC 
compiler, FORTRAN and COBOL. Each is 
a specialized tool for a special programming problem. 
Better tools. And better tools make better programs.

The Apple III Workshop -Not for the Novice 

BY JOHII lEPPSOn 



"SOS checks the vent queue only when exiting to the user 
environment, so if you're hung out waiting for a response from 
a peripheral device, events loill be queued up but not processed 
until the read request is satisfied. " 

This seemingly British double talk is actually Bob Martin 
teaching the Apple III Technical Workshop — a three-day, Ap- 
ple-sponsored whirlwind tour through the remarkable ma- 
chine that lies beneath Apple Ill's languages and application 
programs. 

If you want to know how it all works, this is where you find 
out. They tell all . . . well, perhaps not all, but a great deal. 
They don't actually tell you the central code sequence of the op- 
erating system itself, SOS.Kemel — that's proprietary infor- 
mation, a trade secret — but you won't feel cheated. 

They do tell you the "logical" structure of SOS, however, 
and how to perform SOS calls to utilize its many routines. They 
tell you how to write drivers, so you can create your own inter- 
facing for peripheral devices. They tell you how to write in- 
terpreters, so (in principle) you can write your own language. 
They tell you how to provide for interrupts and events and 
bank switching and alternate stacks and extended addressing 
and environments and file structures and about direct memo- 
ry access (DMA) and pseudo-DMA and, when they don't tell 
you the source code for SOS.Kemel — well, you couldn't have 
swallowed another byte anyway. 

Say "Sauce." The Sophisticated Operating System is the 
soul of Apple ni. For this is a true computer system ; the first, 
perhaps, that Apple has produced. Apple III is far more than a 
6502 CPU chip and some assembly language routines. To quote 
the manual: "The combination of hardware and operating sys- 
tem software creates an abstract machine that is neither the 
hardware nor the operating system, but a synthesis of both. 
This is the machine you program." It is a machine "defined by 
its concepts," concepts that in turn are supported by SOS 
and the hardware and will continue to be supported as the 
present system is changed and improved. Indeed, such 
changes and improvements have already begun and will con- 



tinue. This means that programs you write today will run prop- 
erly on upgraded machines tomorrow, provided you follow the 
rules of the operating system. The "rules" constitute the struc- 
ture of the abstract machine. They may be extended, but they 
will continue to be supported in future versions of Apple HI. 

Of course there's no one to stop you from cheating. In fact, 
the workshop tells you how. You can, for example, bypass SOS 
and write a program in which one piece of code directly and il- 
legally accesses some other section in violation of the rules. 
But future changes in the system will leave you broken and 
bleeding. The point is philosophical but very important. Apple 
is against this sort of rule breaking, but it is not a moral issue. 
Nor is Apple worried about its trade secrets; you're welcome 
to write a disassembler and trace out the code paths in 
SOS.Kemel (it should only take you about a hundred years) . 
The point is, when you cheat you've only got a 6602 and some 
assembly language routines. Playing within the rules, using 
the magnificent tools provided, means that your work will be 
part of a growing, maturing system for many years to come. 

The workshop is conducted about once a month, some- 
where. Generally it is held in a major metropolitan area of the 
United States, but within the past few months it has also been 
held in several cities in Europe. This fall Apple expects to con- 
duct a workshop in Australia. Sessions on the West Coast, like 
the one held April 28-30, are generally held in or near the main 
Apple complex in Cupertino, California. Other West Coast 
locations for workshops are being contemplated. The times 
and locations are not rigidly predetermined. 

Four Week Rush. Preparations for the course are organ- 
ized by the regional Apple Computer offices, which maintain 
a file of individuals in their area who have expressed interest 
in attending a workshop. The optimum class size is about 
thirty, and Apple says they need at least fifteen to break even. 
When enough prospective students are available in a given 
area, the regional offices negotiate with Bob Martin's group to 
arrange a mutually possible time and site. Unfortunately, this 
process usually means the potential student has only about

four weeks' actual notice of when and where the course will 
take place. It would be considerably easier to plan one's sched- 
ule if the advance notice were three months. 

At present, the course has only one instructor, Bob Martin. 
Martin is amazing. A professional engineer, he is dynamic, 
amusing, highly articulate, totally in command of his materi- 
al, and just all-around brilliant. Teaching the workshop is only 
part of his duties. He also heads Apple's Product Marketing 
Technical Support Group, a ten-person team dedicated to as- 
sisting other companies and professionals who are developing 
applications and peripherals for use on Apple III. He says 
there just aren't enough hours in the day, and he Is actively 
looking for another instructor to share the teaching load. This 
would mean the workshop could be given more often and In 
more places. He also hopes to be able to offer specialty courses 
in drivers or interpreters or advanced programming tech- 
niques. At the moment, there just aren't enough of him to go 
around. 

The format of the workshop has changed several times 
since its inception in 1980. In its present configuration, the 
course lasts three full days. About two hours of the first day are 
devoted to a lab session that provides hands-on experience 
using SOS calls. The rest Is lecture. Ample opportunity Is pro- 
vided for discussion and for further development of areas In 
which. class members express particular Interest, such as In- 
vokable modules for Apple Ill's Business Beislc. As It happens, 
the class held in April wound up at noon on the third day. We 
were ready. 

Crammed with Goodies. The text for the workshop Is an 
enormous slx-and-a-half-pound looseleaf notebook. About a 
quarter of it Is the "beta draft" of the forthcoming Apple III 
SOS Reference Manual, which is expected to reach its final 
form and be published in about ninety days. There are also ex- 
tensive class notes and actual source code examples of drivers 
and Interpreters. And there are two disks. The first contains 
source codes of the various examples and other good stuff. 



The other contains ExerSOS, a program that provides prac- 
tical experience using SOS calls and can also be used as a test- 
ing program for debugging new drivers. Of particular Impor- 
tance are skeleton drivers, which are a bit like form letters 
where you can fill in the blanks to create your own driver for a 
new device. These are present both as printed text and on disk. 
They are tremendously helpful when you're ready to start de- 
veloping your own drivers. Finally, there Is a twenty-three- 
page section describing the special procedures Involved In 
writing invokable modules for Business Basic. 

The workshop is about as intense an experience as you're 
likely to encounter, and it's not for everybody. In their ad- 
vance notice Apple says the class is "designed for experienced 
professional programmers. These programmers should be fa- 
miliar with assembly language for the 6502 microprocessor 
and should feel comfortable discussing the Internal logical 
structure of computers." They mean every word of It. 

It also helps immensely to have read, understood, and prac- 
ticed the material on enhanced Indirect addressing In the pro- 
gram preparation tools section of the Pascal III manuals. In 
particular, this is not a course in assembly language program- 
ming. Learn assembly first; then go to the workshop. 

Even if you have the prerequisite knowledge, you must con- 
sider the cost: $500 payable In advance, plus whatever you end 
up spending on transportation, lodging, meals, and so on. (The 
only kindly statement to make about dining out In Cupertino is 
that we were probably just unlucky. For a while, we thought 
we might starve.) The cost is well worth It If you are In the 
computer business, but If you are merely curious, well, that's a 
lot of curiosity. On the other hand, it really is a great course.

uct Marketing Technical Support, Mail Stop 5E; or contact the

Anyone who has ever slid safe into second base or sacked 
the quarterback or sliced a backhand into the far comer or 
made a thirty yard putt or taken the ball down the court for an 
unassisted layup knows that successfully forcing your bones 
and muscles to work together in a coordinated effort is re- 
warding both physically and mentally. 

Competition is the heart and soul of sports. To be the very 
best in the world at any given sport means devoting a large 
portion of your life to the task. A talented few can make a liv- 
ing as professional athletes ; the majority of the population has 
to seek the thrill of athletic competition on less exalted fields. 

The Agony and the Ecstasy. Few people would arg^e that 
being active and healthy is good for the soul. Nonetheless, most 
serious athletic activity involves pain. It doesn't matter if it's 
Little League, the high school swim team, or the corporate 
Softball team; don't sign up unless you're willing to hurt. 

Sports can cause a lot of mental pain, too. There's nothing 
more discouraging than being a second stringer on a Little 
League team. You get stuck in right field for the eighth and 
ninth innings hoping someone will hit the ball your way. Then 
there's the day of the big race when you wake up with a cold 
and the weather is lousy ; or the playoff game when the coach 
makes a bad choice and pulls you from the line-up. All your 
hard work can be for naught when chance or human error has 
its way. 

But when everything goes right — the slapshot ties up the 
goalie, you bowl eight straight strikes, or you clear all the hur- 
dles perfectly — sports are a mental high. Like writing, acting, 
performing music, and other kinds of personal achievement, 
sports allow you to take pride in accomplishment. 

For those unwilling to suffer scraped knees, sore muscles, 
and athlete's foot, there're sports on television and sports on 
the Apple. The difference between the two is that you control 
the action on the Apple. Sure, it's not real, but neither is the Su- 
perbowl when you're watching it two thousand miles away. 
You're a participant in the computer game, and that's impos- 
sible with television. 

Pushing fingers, twisting wrists, and squeezing thumbs are 
the only real physical skills involved with plajdng a computer 
sports game. Though it's possible to feel a rush of adrenalin, 
you can't exactly get in shape. But, in some games, the mental 
gymnastics of sports have made the translation to computers 
rather well. 

And They're Off I The first so-called sports programs for 
the Apple appeared five years ago, and of those simple lo-res 
action games few remain. But they found an audience in their 
day, and we've been blessed (and cursed) with sports pro- 
grams ever since. 

It's difficult to decide which is more misleading: a comput- 
er game that claims to be about a sport but has only the most 
tenuous relation to the real thing, like Programma's Basket- 
ball, or a computer game that purports to be a realistic simu- 
lation but is frustratingly incomplete, like On-Line's Hi-Res 
Football. 

It's impossible to cram all the variables involved in a sport 
into 48K, let alone 32K, 16K, or 8K, so game creators have to 
pick and choose among them. It's up to the software shoppers 
to know what they're looking for and not to buy a program 
without playing it first or seeing it demonstrated at a store. 

Considering the technical limitations of hardware and soft- 
ware in mind, it's essential that computer sports games com- 
pensate for the loss of realism and sophistication. 

Microsoft's Olympic Decathlon accomplishes this with ten 
different track and field events, all demanding practice hand- 
eye coordination, excellent timing, and even finesse. It's chal- 



lenging and fun, worth the investment of time, money, and ef- 
fort. But, in this game and many others, the skills required are 
those of the arcade rather than those inherent in the athletic 
activity portrayed on the screen. 

For example, in Olympic Decathlon's 110-yard high hur- 
dles, you run by alternately pressing the two paddle buttons. If 
you fail to push a button in sequence, the runner stops. Not 
many runners in real life forget to put the other foot down. 

Base on Balls. Other computer sports games forego at- 
tempting to provide the thrill of physically accomplishing the 
sport. In Strategic Simulations's Computer Baseball, you don't 
swing the bat or run the bases or throw the ball. Rather than 
making you learn to twist the paddle a new way. Computer 
Baseball forces you to think and win through strategy. 

Sports games playable on the Apple have been more or less 
limited to these two approaches or juxtapositions of the two. 

Unearthing the ungodly past of computer sports games for 
the Apple provides a chance to see where they have come from 
and where they might be going. These observations are not set 
permanently in granite. Each sports game that claims the 
name must be judged on its own merits. They're all different. 

Scoring on the Power Play. Once there was a company 
called Programma International, based in Los Angeles and 
run by Dave Gordon, now head of DataMost. Programma will 
always be remembered as a software publisher that couldn't 
say no. If it ran, Programma published it. 

Thankfully, it's tough to find any of Programma's old 
games these days. They were pretty bad. Programma's Foot- 
ball and Basketball were based on Mattel's handheld calcula- 
tor games. In Football, you're a lone dot trying to outmaneu- 
ver a sluggish defense. It's possible to score a touchdown on ev- 
ery play. 

Programma's Hi-Res Boocing is a one-punch affair. Two be- 
trunked opponents face off and bash each other until one falls 
down. The fallen boxer gets up and the fight continues until one 
of the two is knocked out. Your choice of punches is a grand to- 
tal of one, and every time you land it your opponent is knocked 
down. A funny thing occurs if you punch too often and don't 
make contact : you fall down from exhaustion without needing 
to be hit. 

Quarterhorse Race from Programma takes you to the race- 
track for a day of races and betting. Its graphics are very 
crude (in contrast, the firm's Canter Doivns had hi-res ani- 
mated graphics approaching today's standards) and the bet- 
ting strategy is the simplest possible. Programma's Apple Al- 
ley is a crude bowling game that's actually pretty tough but 
still isn't a good simulation of the real game. 

Programma's HirRes Baseball provides the thrill of fielding 
the ball and trying to throw a player out at home plate, but the 
animation and graphics are primitive hi-res. Pitching, bat- 
ting, and running the bases are fun; it's possible to curve the 
ball and fool the batter. This game can be found under a new 
name. World Series Baseball, from DataMost. It doesn't ap- 
pear to have changed any. 

Shifting the Backfield. Although no company has flour- 
ished publishing only sports games, many have tried the 
genre. Softape, between card games in 1979, tried baseball, 
and golf. 

Softape 's Baseball Fever by Peter Meng is actually a fun 
little program, though not very sophisticated. The 1979 Boston 
Red Sox and New York Yankees are the opposing teams. You 
make line-up changes and can incorporate very limited strate- 
gy. Like Programma's Hi-Res Baseball, the most fun comes 
with pitching and batting. You can actually pick the place- 
ment of pitches and try to fool batters. In the one-player ver-

sion. the computer pitches a lot of balls, and it takes a good eye 
on the part of the human player to see them coming. 

Jim Wells's Pro Golf from Softape was the first in a line of 
steadily improving golf games for the Apple. The selection of 
clubs is small, and the physical hazards on the course are not 
what you find in Avant-Garde's Hi-Res Computer Golf or Au- 
tomated Simulations's Fore! Still, it must have been wel- 
comed by pro golf fans in 1979 as something to do during the 
long winter months. 

One of the best sport games to appear early on was pro- 
duced by Apple Computer itself. Charlie Kellner and Eric Lar- 
son's Apple Bowl, released in 1979, is still the best bowling 
game available. Using the paddles to control speed and direc- 
tion, you can successfully complete splits (seemingly impossi- 
ble in Programma's Apple Alley). You also have to wait for 
bowlers in the lanes nejct to you, definitely a feature of the real 
sport. The animation and hi-res graphics are superior, and the 
game uses accurate engineering to give a reasonable simula- 
tion of the real thing. 

After the first wave of sports games, the scene could only 
improve. The years 1980 and 1981 saw a slew of games emerge, 
though not all were greaX improvements on what had been pub- 
lished before. 

On-Line Systems released Jay Sullivan's Hi-Res Football, a 
woefully inadequate representation of the game that nonethe- 
less enjoyed some market success. Offering the ability to con- 
trol the game in real time, Sullivan's program suffers from a 
dearth of offensive and defensive plays, and the teams are 
made up of only seven players instead of the regulation eleven. 
Playing against the computer, you never lose. If the computer 
gets the ball, it gives it right back and you start another set of 
offensive downs. 

Hi-Res Football is a good example of the double nature of 
some sports games. As a simulation of football, the game is 
frustratingly awful. Not as bad as Programma's Mattel-like 
Football, but not at all good. 

On the other hand, if you forget that it's supposed to be foot- 



ball, Hi-Res Whatever is a challenging two-player game offer- 
ing its own excitement. Sullivan's Hi-Res Soccer, also re- 
leased through On-Line Systems, is in the same boat. As a real- 
istic simulation, it stinks; as an arcade-type game, it has its 
moments. (It's interesting to note that Sullivan, once he di- 
gressed from sports, went on to produce Crossfire, possibly the 
best home-arcade game extant.) 

Downhill Thrills. Another game that is fun but not really a 
good simulation is Continental's 3-D Skiing by Jeffrey Stanton. 
The slalom portion of the program is mostly arcade-style with 
some realistic aspects. Ski jumping calls for practiced timing, 
but it's too simplified and a tad unrealistic. On very long jumps 
you land on flat ground and survive. 

But both parts of 3-D Skiing are rip-snorting good fun if 
you're in the right mood. The ski jump animation is hilarious. 
Crashing a jumper rivals putting the shot backward in Olym- 
pic Decathlon. 

A good sports program not only gives you a reasonably 
realistic simulation of the game but also teaches you some- 
thing about how the game is played in real life. The early Pro- 
gramma games, with the exception of Hi-Res Baseball, fall on 
both accounts. Hi-Res Baseball at least teaches you the value 
of throwing a curve. 

Creative Computing's Micro Golf is not very educational. 
You don't have a choice of clubs. The ball ricochets off the 
sides of the course like miniature golf. It's a fun game, but not 
for the serious golfer — and it certainly won't help the novice 
understand the real game. 

Swinging through Woods and Wedges. Much better are 
Avant-Garde's Hi-Res Computer Golf by Stuart Aronoff, and 
Automated Simulations's Fore! by Jeffrey A. Johnson. 

In Aronoff 's fine program, you actually swing the club. Al- 
though it is essentially an arcade-game feature, swinging the 
club gives you some idea of good golfing form. Showing what 
happens when a ball is sliced or topped, Hi-Res Computer Golf 
helps you learn from mistakes. This is a tough game to mas- 
ter, frustrating as all get out, but well worth the effort.

When you get to the putting green, it's sloped like a real 
course. Just aiming the club at the hole doesn't mean it'll go in. 
Wind also plays a big part in the proceedings, as it does in the 
real game. Hi-Res Computer Golf brings new challenges at ev- 
ery turn and ranks as one of the best sports games available. 

Fore! is similar to Hi-Res Computer GoZ/ without the fun of 
swinging and the education of missed shots. With the largest 
selection of clubs, Automated Simulations's game features 
several tough courses with some killer holes. 

Take Me Out to the Apple. Strategic 's baseball game is rich 
in variables. You are given a real team to play with. The 
choices include recent teams and classic World Series match- 
ups, like the 1906 Chicago Cubs against the 1906 Chicago White 
Sox. You pick the starting line-up, fielding positions, and bat- 
ting order from a twenty-five man roster. To make up your 
mind, you're given batting averages and pitching records. 

In Computer Baseball, gone is the chance to KO Carl Yast- 
rzemski on a called third strike like you could in Softape's 
Baseball Fever. Except for real time input, the only things 
missing are hot dogs and peanuts; so stock up. 

Before each play you control how the players will react with 
a number of offensive and defensive options. But, like the 
game itself, chance plays a big part in the proceedings. 

The visual representation of action in Computer Baseball is 
simplified to the bare minimum, showing the movement of 
only the ball. But it's not really important to show the pitcher's 
windup or the batter's swing. The important thing is the out- 
come of these actions in relation to strategies employed and 
the game as a whole. 

Strategic Simulation's Computer Quarterback is another 
game that is short on visual representation but long on sophis- 
tication and game detail. The program allows you to choose be- 
tween semipro or pro ball. The professional version has thirty- 
six offensive plays and twenty-four defensive plays. 

Like Computer Baseball, the action of the game is con- 
tained on a rectangular field, occupying about one-third of the 
screen. You see the movement of the ball, but not much else.

Tuesday Morning Quarterback takes a different approach. 
The strategic aspects of this amusing game are similar to 
Computer Quarterback's, with fewer available plays. The dif- 
ference lies in arcadelike portions of the action. When it's time 
to kick a field goal or to punt, you have to pick the right mo- 
ment. It's like Apple Bowl, where you line up a moving arrow 
with the place on the lane where you want to release the ball. 

Tuesday Morning Quarterback also gives you the option of 
changing the line-up around. You're given a full complement 
of NFL teams to choose from and you can doctor rosters. 

The strategic aspects of Tuesday Morning Quarterback 
may not beat the competition, but other features of this game 
make it unique, if not a bit weird. The action of the game is re- 
layed in an exciting sportscaster style: "Tarkington drops 
back, he stumbles, he's getting pressure, he lobs it . . . Incom- 
plete" — something like that. When half time comes you're 
treated to the "marching dots" show, a cute, colorful, lo-res 
graphics routine that might go on forever if not interrupted for 
the second half. 

One of the most dangerous sports is Grand Prix racing and 
Riverbank Software's simulation of the high-speed action Is 
terrific. The graphics are nothing to write home to mother 
about, but they get the job done. Using a simple 3-D effect, In- 
ternational Gran Prix gives you some idea of what It's like to 
drive at 205 miles an hour. 

The game is detailed and challenging, with five complete 
courses to choose from, including real ones like Monaco and 
the Karlskoga Circuit in Sweden. You steer by turning the pad- 
dle knob and change gears and accelerate with the paddle but- 
ton. It takes a little practice. Thankfully, in this game, no harm 
is done when in fifth gear you scream toward Creek Comer on 
Australia's Warwick Farm Circuit with no chance in heaven of 
making the turn. 

The Sport of Kings. In our investigations, we could find no 
games that actually sat you down on the horse, but a couple 
good horse racing programs are out. Usually, you're just a 
spectator at the racetrack with a wad of money in these 
games. Yet they're interesting and educational, even though 
they're essentially gambling games like cards or roulette. 

Raff Craft's Derby Downs, A Day at the Races is a nifty lit- 
tle program that offers the kind of superior challenge found in 
good strategy games. Before placing bets for one of six races, 
you're given all kinds of useful information on the horses' and 
jockeys' previous races. For those unfamiliar with the race- 
track, this program can be very informative. 

Derby Downs teaches you to read the racing form. The 
Form Sheet option shows you a horse's most recent races (up 
to twenty) and the jockey that rode each race. Detailed infor- 
mation is given about each race, including lead lengths from 
the frontrunner at the quarter, half, three-quarters, and finish. 
Another program option displays each jockey's complete rac- 
ing record, displaying wins, places, and shows. 

Another horse racing and betting game is Derby from Bl- 
Taction, in DOS 3.2. A number of players are given $200 cash to 
bet on ten races a day; each race has eight horses. The vari- 
ables are not as diverse as in Raff-Craft's Derby Downs, but 
the jockey's performance, the weight the horse is carrying, 
and track conditions all figure in the outcome. Odds are given 
for each horse in a race, with a full range of betting options — 
everything from the daily double to the perfecta and trlfecta. 

Sportsware, a small company in Gretna, Louisiana, has re- 
leased A Year at the Races. In this program you handicap top 
horses through an entire season, updating statistics as you go 
along. The results are fairly realistic, and Sportsware has 
more sports statistics programs in the works. 

Fleecing the Profit Prophets. Ken Perry of Systems De- 
sign Lab has fattened a few wallets with his three-point spread 
and handicapping prediction programs. These aren't games 
but qualify as sports programs for our money. They're educa- 
tional and provide the thrill of winning or losing cash — certain- 
ly an important aspect of sports in some people's minds. 

SDL's Win at the Races, College Football, and Pro Foot- 
ball are famous for outpredicting the odds makers. These 
are complicated programs that are not complicated to use. 



CONTINENTAL'S 
HOME ACCOUNTANT IS NUMBERONE- 

AND CLIMBING 



For the past several months, Softalk magazine has 
rated Continental Software's Home Accountant™ 
No. 1 in its "Home 10" best-seller list. 

A lot of programs would have "peaked" by 
now. But with over 10,000 copies in use, Home 
Accountant just keeps getting stronger 

There's a reason for this spectacular suc- 
cess — and it's not just the low suggested price 
of $74.95. 

The fact is, Home Accountant is one of those 
rare programs that virtually everybody can profit 
from using. It's powerful enough to handle even 
the most complicated family budget — yet it's so 



easy to use that one quick trip through the manual 
may be all you'll ever need. 

With Home Accountant you can track up to 
100 budget categories, 5 different checking ac- 
counts, and all the credit cards you can carry. Just 
press a few keys and watch the program print your 
checks, net worth and other financial statements. 
And when you see the full-color graphs of actual vs. 
budgeted expenses, trend line analyses, etc., you'll 
know you bought the best.

JULY 1982 



You have to be patient, and don't look for any real results in foot- 
ball betting until the sixth or seventh game of the season. By 
then, the football programs should have enough information to 
make very accurate predictions. Perry's latest pro football 
program. The Gold Edition, is brand-new. 

Probably the all-time bestselling sports game is Micro- 
soft's Olympic Decathlon, and it's easy to see why. The game 
incorporates arcade game challenges but its many parts and 
variety are enough to get people involved. The ten events re- 
quire practice but the ability to move among them keeps you 
from getting frustrated; if you're having trouble with the dis- 
cus throw, there's always the pole vault. 

In terms of animation and graphics, Olympic Decathlon is 
tough to beat. Alone, they're worth half the admission price. 
Pole vaulting, long jumping, high jumping, and running the 
110-meter hurdles are all a blast once you get the hang of 
them, and the graphics for each are worth a good chuckle. 

But if Olympic Decathlon falls short on realism, it more 
than makes up for this in total effect. You really feel like 
you've accomphshed something after struggling through all 
ten events. Strategic Simulations's games have the same ef- 
fect. You feel like you're participating in something larger 
than life — a response that, given the miniaturization of the 
sports, could only be accomplished on a computer. 

Where's the Good Doctor and Magic? Limited input from 
the player will always make computer games a poor substi- 
tute for the real thing. Paddles, keyboard, joystick — it doesn't 
matter. You just can't lob a football with a computer. But with 
increased memory it should be possible to include many of the 
variables that go into a fast-action game like hockey or bas- 
ketball. 

In a hypothetical basketball game, you could have two 
human players on each team for a total of four participants. 
Each human could control two or three players of his team, 
making it possible to work plays, incorporate strategy, and 
keep the speed and excitement found in the real sport. 

A Sporting Chance on the Future. At their best, computer 
sports games offer the chance to learn about and appreciate 



the skills involved in athletic competition. The day will come 
when a, viable alternative to watching a boring out-of-state col- 
lege football game on television will be playing an exciting one 
on the Apple. 

And with a little luck, you'll have fun while playing. Now, 
that wasn't too painful, was it?

ARTSCI explains why some word 
processing systems are better tlian otiiers. 



BASIC WORD PROCESSING 

The primary feature of a professional 
word processing system is the ability to 
enter and edit data in a fast and 
"friendly" manner 

A word processing system is simply an 
easier, faster and less expensive way to 
type. With a modern word processor, 
documents are entered on a video screen 
instead of on paper 

Just enter your first draft quickly, 
without concern for errors, then go back 
and correct the spelling, delete words, 
even move paragraphs with a few 
keystrokes. You only print it when it's 
perfect, so no document ever has to be 
retyped. 

MAGIC WINDOW*' 

Apple II— the most versatile, 
inexpensive microcomputer available 
today— can perform almost any task. 
And with Artsci's MAGIC WINDOW word 
processing program, the Apple II has the 
full power of a professional word 
processing system. 



if''- 




IVIAGIC WINDOW operates just like a 
standard typewriter The electronic 
"paper" moves to the left across the 
video screen as you type. Lines 
representing the edges of the "paper" 
can be seen on the screen. You can set 
these to any size, so you always know 
where your copy is in relation to the size 
of the paper you'll be using. 

Of course, the Apple II has a video 
display of 40 charaaers across, and letter- 
size paper usually has 80 characters 
across. So, how can you see everything 
you've typed? 

With just a keystroke, you can move 
the "paper" across the screen, enabling 
you to see the full 80-character line. 



There are no complexities, no additional 
hardware expenses. 

The rule is: What you see (on the 
screen) is what you get (in 
print.) Using 
proportional spacing, 
the result will look 
even better than 
what's on the screen. 

MAGIC WINDOW'S 
typewriter simulation, 
simple-to-use menus 
for funaion selection, and 
electronic editing, provide the finest basic 
word processing system available for the 
Apple II. 

MAGIC WORDS '* 

The second feature of an advanced 
word processor is the ability to find and 
correct the most common mistakes in 
documents— misspelled words and 
typos. 

ARTSCI'S MAGIC WORDS program will 
take any document you create and find 
typing or spelling errors. Over 14,000 
commonly misspelled words are known 
to MAGIC WORD'S dictionary. You can 
also add new words at any time, so the 
vocabulary suits your special needs. 

MAGIC MAILER 

The third feature of a professional 
word processing system is the ability to 
personalize a document by inserting 
names and other related data from 
mailing lists. 

Form letters, invoices, and almost any 
document can be individualized by 
replacing names, addresses or other 
personal data anywhere in the 
document. 

By using MAGIC MAILER you can take 
any mailing list, select those names on 
the list that fit any recorded criteria you 
choose (e.g., age, city, ZIP code) and 
print personalized letters with a few 
simple keystrokes. 

A COMPLETE SYSTEM 

These three programs— MAGIC 
WINDOW, MAGIC WORDS and MAGIC 
MAILER— together form the MAGIC 
SERIES, the most complete and 
professional word processing system 
available for the standard Apple II 
computer system.

Hi-res graphics are not an inherent part of the Basic lan- 
guage. When the folks at Apple introduced hi-res graphics to 
the language, they added new commands that deal with vec- 
tor shapes. A vector shape is one composed of lines; the lines, 
or vectors, define the shape saved. Before vector shapes, 
shapes were saved only by the lengthy point-on, point-off defi- 
nitions. 

An example of a vector shape definition is something like 
"plot a line up one unit, plot a line left one unit, plot a line down 
one unit, plot a line right one unit"— that would give you a 
square. 

A group of vector shapes saved for use in a program is a 
shape table. 

All these commands are built into Applesoft. 

The advantages of defining shapes by the vectors are the 
abilities to scale and rotate the shapes easily. To scale, you just 
have to multiply the lengths by a number. To rotate a shape, 
you change the directions by some offset. The disadvantages of 
this type of shape are that it is too slow for smooth, fast anima- 
tion, and that the shapes are limited in color and detail. (Be- 
fore anyone jumps all over that one, yes, it is possible to create 
a very detailed and multicolored vector shape, but doing so 
eliminates the advantages of vector shapes : rotation and scal- 
ing. Rotating and scaling destroy any intricacies of color and 
detail. There are better solutions.) 

There's one other advantage, though. Because there are 
commands built into Applesoft for dealing with these shapes, 
vector shapes make a very good learning tool for beginning 
animation. 

Creating a Shape. The first step in working with a shape ta- 
ble is to design a shape. If you look at pages 92-96 in your Ap- 
plesoft Basic Programming Reference Manual, you might be 
able to bumble through and define a shape. Most people, how- 
ever, see that section, find binary numbers and arrows mixed 
with hexadecimal digits, and their eyes glaze over. After a few 
more of these columns, yours may too. But for now let's pre- 
tend we're all beginners. 

The progfram in figure 1 is a sweet little Basic program that 
lets you draw a shape and store it in a single-shape table. 
(Shape tables can store multitudes of shape definitions, all ac- 
cessible by number, but to keep things simple we'll go with our 
table of one.) The programming details will be left to those 
who like to read the incomprehensible ; the program basically 
accomplishes what the Applesoft manual tries to explain. (The 
routine itself is actually half-lifted partially out of context firom 
a set of programs called The Complete Graphics System by 
Chris Jochumson and Mark Pelczarski — with permission from 
the authors.) 

Type in the program, save to disk (call it Shape Maker or 
something like that) , then run it. The hi-res screen clears, and 
several controls are available to you. Your joystick or paddles 
control the scale and rotation of the shape you draw. (If you 
don't have either paddles or joystick, change line 30 so that S = 
1 and R = 0, histead of the formulas given.) The I,J,K, and M 
keys are your direction keys. I is up, M is down, J is left, and K 
is right, just as on the keyboard. Try using them; you should

see your shape being drawn. If you keep the rotation set to 
zero, and the scale to one, you'll see the shape as it will be 
stored. Scaling and rotations can be used again later. Other 
controls are the Z and X keys, to turn the plotting on and off. 
Type F when you finish, name your shape, and it will be saved 
to disk. It's crude but effective; besides, it's definitely easier 
than hexadecimal and cheaper than bujdng a package just for 
drawing simple shapes. 

Using Your Shape in a Program. There's a group of com- 
mands designed strictly for drawing shapes from a shape ta- 
ble from a Basic program. The first is the command that loads 
the table into memory so the program can use it: 

10 PRINT CHR$(4);"BLOAD name,A24576" 

This is a binary load of your shape table, with whatever name 
you used, from disk to memory (RAM) , starting at RAM ad- 
dress 24576. After that, you have to poke in two pointers that 
will tell your program at which address you loaded the table. 
For location 24576, used above, the pokes are: 

20 POKE 232,0 : POKE 233,96 

If you want to know where those numbers came from, read the 



134 



JULY 1982 



next two paragraphs. If you'd rather come back to it later in- 
stead of hitting confusing issues now, skip ahead. 

The numbers correspond to the way addresses are usually 
stored in the computer. You may remember that in any single 
byte of memory you can store the numbers 0 to 255. To fit a 
larger address, you need two bytes. One hyte holds the num- 
ber of ones, the other holds the number of 2568. A simple ex- 
ample would be in base 10. Imagine you've got two slots that 
can only hold two digits each. The number 1587 could be bro- 
ken up as 15 and 87, with 15 being the number of hundreds and 
87 being the number of ones. You get the number for the first 
slot by dividing by 100 (lopping off the first two digits of a four- 
digit number) and the number for the second slot by taking the 
remainder. As long as you remember which is which — so you 
don't get the number 8715 — you're okay. 

With the Apple, instead of dealing with hundreds, you di- 
vide the number by 256s. The address we used to load our 
shape table at, 24576, divided by 256 is 96, with a remainder of 
zero. Therefore, 96 should be put in the high-order byte, and 
zero in the low-order byte. The only other item that may be 
confusing is that most of the time the addresses are stored in 
low/high format. Notice that with the two pokes above, we put 
zero (the low byte of the address or the remainder after divid- 
ing by 256) into location 232, and 96 into location 233. The first 
location gets the low byte, and the second location gets the high 
byte. Weird, maybe, but it's pretty consistent. 

Two Paragraphs La.ter. The commands that affect the plot- 
ting of shapes are hcolor, rot (rotation), scale, draw, and 
xdraw. Draw draws a shape at the coordinates you specify. 
Once a shape table is loaded and the address is poked into the 
necessary locations (232 and 233) , you can use draw for any 
shape in the table. To wit: 

20 DRAW 1 AT 100,150 

draws shape one in the table at the coordinates 100, 150. 

Hcolor sets the color for all subsequent hplots and draws, 
meaning that you can set the color in which your shape is 
drawn to any of the six standard hl-res colors. 

Rot controls the rotation that subsequent draws will use. 
Rot = 0 is normal, rot = 16 is 90 degrees rotation, rot = 32 is 180 
degrees, rot = 48 is 270 degrees, and rot = 64 is a full 360-de- 



gree rotation. Intermediate values give varying angles be- 
tween those listed, depending on the scale used. The higher the 
scale, the more points of rotation you have available. 

Scale sets the scale of the subsequent draw commands. 
Scale = 1 is normal, scale = 2 is double size, scale = 3 is triple 
size, and so on. 

Xdraw looks like a draw command but it doesn't use a col- 
or. It just reverses everything on the screen where the object is 
being drawn. If the background was white, the shape is drawn 
in black, and vice versa. Xdraw is sometimes nice because a 
second xdraw at the same location erases the shape and re- 
stores the background to its original state. 

Simple Animation. Moving one object at a time around the 
screen works all right with shape tables. The lack of speed 
really starts to show when you try to move more than one ob- 
ject. One object, though, gives us enough to start some simple 
animation. 

Create a shape with the Shape Maker program, then type in 
the program in figure 2. That program goes through the basics 
of animation. First you need to initialize all your information. 
From then on, it's a simple cycle: draw the shape on the

screen, update the coordinates, erase the shape at the old co- 
ordinates, and repeat. Draw, update, erase, draw, update, 
erase — ad infinitum. 

Notice that lines 10-50 initialize everything. Line 10 lets you 
input your shape's name, and line 20 bloads it into the location 
we want. Line 30 sets the hi-res graphics screen, and pokes the 
necessary pointer locations with the address of the table. Line 
40 sets the rotation and scale to normal, and line 60 sets the 
starting x and y coordinates for our animation, and sets XC 
and YC (x change and y change) to two each. Each time we go 
through the loop in this example, we'll use XC and YC to up- 
date the coordinates. 

Line 60 begins the animation cycle by drawing the shape at 
location x,y. Lines 70-120 save the old coordinates in XL, YL 
and update them. Line 130 erases the shape by xdrawlng again 
at the old coordinates, XL, YL. Line 140 causes the sequence to 
be repeated. 

Why draw- update-erase and save the old coordinates, in- 
stead of draw-erase-update? Because the update part of the cy- 
cle is the one that takes the most time, and during that time 
you want your shape on the screen. By erasing before the up- 
date, you'd have more time with your shape off the screen and 
a lot more flickering would be apparent. 
I Looking at the update cycle, notice that we use XC and YC 
to change the x and y coordinates. That's just an arbitrary for- 
mula; try playing aroimd with various ways of modifying x 
and y. Notice, though, that in lines 90-120 we check the range of 
the new x and y coordinates. If either is less than zero, or if x is 
greater than 279 or y greater than 191, trying any draw, xdraw, 
or hplot command will result in an error. Use lines like 90-120 
anjrtime you're not positive that the result of a computation 
will be within those bounds. 

The last example is a simple animation program similar to 
that in figure 2, spiffed up just a little. Instead of using XC and 
YC as the x and y offset, we'll use the joystick (or paddle) 
values to determine which way to move. We'll also add a cou- 
ple of optional lines that play with the rotation and scale of the 
shape. Note that figure 3 varies at lines 50 and 80 from figure 2, 
and that lines 90-120 are shortened. Lines 132 and 134 are op- 
tional and can be added or deleted at any time to demonstrate 
their effect. 

As always, try whatever variations you want. You won't 
break the computer trying. 

Note: In the first part of this series, there was an Inset 
about binary numbers. Somewhere between here (where I 
type now) and there (the magazine you read) some exponents 
disappeared. All those 10s and 2s on the top rows of the exam- 
ples should have had tiny exponents floating slightly above and 
to their right. The rightmost 10 or 2 in each row should have an 
exponent of zero, the second from the right should have an ex- 
ponent of 1, the third from the right should have an exponent of 
2, and so on.

Summertime Apples: beeping happily through the long, 
lazy days . . . booting a tall, cool one . . . burning EPROMs in 
the back yard. . . . Once again the Apples of the free world 
have time on their keys and are obligated to keep their onmers 
engrossed at greater length than at any other time of the year. 
To do that, they know they'll need new programs — lots of 
them, in wide and varied array. Softalk obliges with its annual 
expanded Marketalk Reviews section, this year extended into 
August, taking the guesswork out of summer program pur- 
chasing so your Apple can just lie back and enjoy. 

The New Step By Step. By John Victor. This Is a "teaching pro- 
gram" that teaches you Basic — but that's an understatement. 
This one is to most teaching programs what Wizardry is to Ad- 
venture ; it maltes learning Basic more Interesting, and more 
fun, than some of the games out there! 

Calling it a "teaching program" is an understatement for 
another reason — you don't get just a program, you get a whole 
"teaching environment." The package contains two prog^'am 
disks, two audio cassettes (you'll need a cassette player), and 
an excellent workbook containing fifty pages of lesson sum- 
maries and practice problems. The creators call this package 
an "interactive course," and that describes it very well. 

In essence, the program works like this: the Apple displays 
examples and demonstrations while a taped voice explains 
them. Every few minutes this process stops and you are asked 
some simple questions about what you have just learned. If 
you answer correctly, you are rewarded with a random pat- 
tern of musical bleeps and the program continues. 

This is an excellent teaching technique. You hear a point 
explained, simply and clearly; you see it demonstrated, often 
with well-designed animation, in one or two sample pro- 
grams; then you answer questions about it, and you must get 
them right before you can continue. The questions are not dif- 
ficult. Their purpose is not to challenge you, but simply to 
make you do something with what you have just learned. If you 
can use the learning to answer a question, then you have truly 
learned the item or concept and can go on to something else. 

If not, you get to keep trying until you find the right 
answer — and that, too, will teach you something! 

But that won't happen often. Usually you will know the 
answer as soon as you see the question or will at least see how 
to figure it out. The program is well designed in that respect: 
you always have enough information to answer the questions ; 
you just have to put the information together. 

And what controls all this activity? What sjmchronizes the 
lectures, demonstrations, questions, and so on? Why, you do, in 
reponse to various signals. A high-pitched beep from the tape 
tells you to press a key on the Apple which calls the next dis- 
play, and a lower-pitched, bell-like tone tells you to stop the 
tape and answer a question on the computer. \\Tien you get the 
right answer, the Apple's speaker chirps a reward, and the 
screen tells you to start the tape again. 

You soon get into the habit of controlling the system with- 
out having to think about it. And that control gives you one 
great advantage : you can choose your own learning speed. If 
you start feeling rushed you can just stop. Answer a question 
and then don't restart the tape when it tells you to. That will 
give you a chance to think about what you've learned before 
you have to deal with the next thing. You can't do that in a 
classroom ! 

Speaking of classrooms, this interactive course includes 



two familiar classroom drags — quizzes and homework (they 
call it "practice problems") — but they're not so bad here. The 
quizzes are made up of the same kinds of questions you have 
been answering during the lesson. Any that you miss are a use- 
ful tip-off that you didn't get something as clear as you thought 
you did (look it up in the lesson summary). And the practice 
problems are simple but interesting, rather like hobby or 
game programs scaled down to the student's level. 

A good teaching program must do three things. It must 
cover the necessary material ; it must teach so the student re- 
members and can use the material ; it must make all of this in- 
teresting and preferably entertaining. This interactive course 
scores close to one hundred on all three counts. 

If you want to learn Basic or would like a little guidance and 
encouragement added to what you already know, then the way

Chopllfter. By Dan Gorlin. As the fence marking the border of 
the Bungeling Empire passes below you, you ease back on the 
throttle of your trusty helicopter and ponder the mission before 
you. Somewhere out in that desert are four buildings where 
your fellow countrypersons are being held hostage by the 
merciless Bungelers (Bungelings?). All you have to do is 
swoop in and pick them up — providing that you can locate 
them. You've been warned about the patrolling tanks, and you 
watch the sky for the occasional jet fighter. Below you the fea- 
tureless terrain slips by. 

Suddenly you see a tiny figfure waving at you from below. 
Some of the hostages must have escaped. You push down on 
the throttle and drop gently to earth, your recently assembled 
chopper bouncing slightly as you wait for the runillng figure to 
clamber on board. More hostages are dashing toward you 
when you hear the rumbUng of a tank and are rocked by a 
nearby explosion. Can you tough it out any longer? 

The decision is yours, but no matter what you decide, there 
are more tanks awaiting you at every touchdown. And should 
you destroy a hapless tank or two, there are plenty of lethal air- 
craft and the dreaded drone-homing mines to keep you on your 
toes. 

Choplifter is a delightful mixture of arcade excitement and 
graphics whimsy, executed with a realism seldom found in en- 
tertainment software. From the helicopter with its twirling 
main blade and spinning tail rotor to the frantic yet polite 
hostages who wave goodbye after you drop them off, Chop- 
lifter is a kick. 

Your base of operations is a post office, complete with Old 
Glory fluttering in the breeze, beyond the border of the Bun- 
geling Empire. It's something of a sanctuary, for neither the 
tanks nor the jets will follow you there. The same does not hold 
true, however, for your friends the drone mines. 

If Choplifter has a failing, it's that it's over too soon. There 
are only sixty-four hostages, and you can carry sixteen per 
journey. You are given three helicopters to complete the task. 
With some practice, you will learn to survive the mission, but 
the real challenge is getting as many hostages as possible 
back alive. Therein lies the true heart of the game. You are not 
trying to rack up a high score in this one ; to do so would be dis- 
tracting. You don't get points for destroying the enemy, nor is 
getting the hostages back to safety rewarded in any symbolic 
fashion. You simply must try to get as many back alive as you 
can— the only score is the tally of hostages dead and rescued.

That almost pushes Choplifter into the realm of simulation. 

You may inadvertently land on one of the fleeing hostages 
during the excitement of dodging tank and/or aircraft fire. Do- 
ing so kills the hostage as surely as any enemy action. And it 
hurts: you failed in your mission. And the hostages are so, 
well, personable. Not only do they wave, but if you land next to 
a building containing several, none will venture out until they 
see someone else clamber aboard. Then there's a mad nosh to 
get picked up. And they're so grateful when you drop them off. 

All in all, it appears a good deal of thought went into the de- 
tails of Choplifter. Playable with joystick only, it's a step 
beyond the mindless (although diverting) shoot-'em-ups that 
populate the arcade field. The thoughtfulness is welcome ; the 
game itself is fun. What's the next step?

Sheila. By Brian Fitzgerald. In one comer are the home-ar- 
cade game enthusiasts: proponents of blazing battle action, 
high-scoring coordination, and tricky mazes. In the other cor- 
ner are the adventurers : weavers of arcane spells and practi- 
tioners of mind-twisting logic on the slow, interactive trek to 
glory. In struts a seductive new game called Sheila, splitting 
the warring factions down the middle. Wolf whistles come 
from both sides ; a new breed has entered the arena. Built with 
some of the best features of both sides, she's got crossover ap- 
peal. 

Right off, it's apparent that Sheila favors the arcade as- 
pects of computer gaming — chomping monsters, hand 
weapons, bombs, and intricate mazes. Adventure game as- 
pects — finding tools and weapons, earning spells, rescuing 
Sheila — have been added to this, expanding on the action with 
imagination and success. 

Sheila makes you fight your way through creatures on four 
levels while you hunt for transport pills, spears, bombs, and a 
shrinking device, all stashed in rooms and dead ends of each 
maze. When you get over 500 points, you can start earning 
spells like plague, get weapons, and defuse that make your 
quest a touch of a key easier. Your final goal in the game is to 
find the four parts of a key hidden in alcoves on level four. You 
must deposit these, in order, in the four comers of the tower 
room to release Sheila from her penthouse prison. 

If you fail to get to the top with at least one of your first 
ninety-nine lives. Sheila may capriciously grant you a resur- 
rection, but don't count on it. What you can count on is hearing 
The Godfather theme and "Greensleeves" if you lose a round. 

You can acquire more than two hundred spears per game 
as you work your way to the tower. Teleport pills are what 
you're really after, however; they're what actually get you 
from level to level. Finding them seems simple enough at 
first, until they change locations. Then, well . . . good luck. 
The same chicanery applies to spears and bombs. 

When the game tells you you have rescued Sheila (and, no, 
she is not the duck) , don't expect to stop for champagne and 
promises. You still have to fight your way back through the 
four levels and out the front door of the castle before you are 
out of trouble. 

Sheila is totally keyboard controlled. Four keys give you 
movement, four keys give you firing direction, and each spell 
has its own casting key. Consecutively higher skill levels are 
provided; unfortunately, you can't save a game to disk. May- 
be next time. 

New quests, spells, tools, and buildings are promised in up- 
dated versions of the game. The graphics in this first install- 
ment are a bit rough, but this in no way detracts from the en- 
joyment of playing. 

Here's to Sheila, the bigamous bride of adventure-arcade 
games, and the mother of many enjoyable mutant offspring 
sure to come.

MlcroFlnesse. Quick! What's the name of the oldest spread- 
sheet program for microcomputers? Trick question? You bet. 
But when you unpack the manual for MicroFinesse, a Pascal- 



based spreadsheet program from England, and read the first 
sentence, all thoughts of seeing another VisiCalc clone flee the 
mind: "Finesse is a financial modeling program that was de- 
veloped in the early 1970s for the P-E Consulting Group in Eng- 
land." This is the grandfather-apparent. So you dive back into 
the package, come out with four disks and a very serious look- 
looking protection device for the paddle socket and press on. 

The program offers all the usual financial forecasting rou- 
tines, plus built-in hi-res color graphics abilities which include pie 
charts, histograms, and graphs. And if that's not enough, you can 
create a set of sixteen color slides and put on a self-timed slide 
show for your presentations. In addition, you can have resident up 
to fifteen user-defined report formats, and also consolidate models 
or expand them, all without reprogramming. This is the stuff of 
mainframe heaven, all available right there in your Apple. 

The program can handle a model of up to 5,000 cells. Your 
model could have dimensions of 50 x 100 or 125 x 40 cells. 

To give you an idea of the program's capabilities, consider 
this. A major feature of spreadsheet programs is known as the 
"what if" function. What if costs go up 12 percent, or what if 
taxes are lowered 20 percent (ha ha) . In the other programs 
we've seen, you input the new value into your model and run 
it. Then if you want to see another "what if," you do it again. 
MicroFinesse has automated this process so you can say, 
"Show the results for a cost increase of 1 to 20 percent by steps 
of 1 percent." You then sit back and watch it do all the work — 
which is why you bought the computer, right? 

Suppose you want to know what your maximum labor cost 
can be, at the present sales level, to allow you to eam 9 per- 
cent, after taxes, on sales. Once again you push a few keys and 
watch the computer figure it out for you. And remember, it can 
do all this without changing your basic model. Nothing is al- 
tered in any cell unless you direct it to be done. 

The performance of the program is at least as good as the 
manual and sales literature promises, and in some cases, you 
will be surprised by the sophistication of features for which the 
documentation doesn't prepare you.

There is a brief tutorial but the program has so many pos- 
sibilities that a thousand pages could not do it justice. The best 
way to approach MicroFinesse is to let your imagination fly 
and search the index to find the way. 

While the program is not cheap, it contains most every- 
thing that the Visi programs offer as extra cost additions and 
some they don't have at all. This makes it quite a bargain. 

It is quite easy to use. You can move just a part of your 
model to another disk or consolidate it with or into another 
model by simply following screen prompts. The slides are easy 
to construct and need no keyboard input if you are using infor- 
mation from your model. The graphics disk can be used alone 
to make up hi-res slides of anything you can tj^e at the key- 
board. This includes text slides with a choice of seven back- 
ground colors and either black or white lettering. 

While this program uses the Pascal language, it is trans- 
parent to the user. You would not need to enter the Pascal sys- 
tem except to transfer an occasional file from disk to disk. 

Problems encountered were of a minor nature and in each 
case were caused by changes in the program that the manual 
did not yet reflect. One may be occasionally halted by the Brit- 
ish terminology, but, after a spot of tea or some such, one 
should be able to press on. A little research in the index should 
answer all your questions. 

If you have the Pascal system and are considering pur- 
chase of a spreadsheet program, you woiold be well-advised to 
look into this one before making a decision.

C)ondor 20. By Robert Cohen. Condor 20 is a relational data- 
base management scheme (DBMS) . It has none of the limi- 
tations of a personal filing system, and it has extra properties of 



its own. Record length and file size are virtually unrestricted, 
you can design your own forms or model them after existing 
ones. You can add or delete variables after a database has been 
created, and you can join several databases into one. 

Most of Condor's work, sorting and accessing files, is done 
behind the scenes. Frequently, the ultimate end user — a man- 
ager, a secretary, a policeman, or a shipping clerk — is com- 
pletely unaware that a Condor database manager is in use. 

Condor will appeal to all present and potential consultants. 
With the aid of just a few of Condor's simple but powerful Eng- 
lish-like commands, it is possible to create a variety of data 
management systems. The starter system alone. Condor 20-1, 
comes with three preprogrammed applications: mailing la- 
bels, client tracking, and project control. 

Typical uses for Condor-created databases include main- 
taining personnel, property, sales, and vehicle maintenance 
records and tracking loan applications and sales perform- 
ance. One of the most extensive applications is a Condor-based 
system used by the National Broadcasting Company for track- 
ing syndicated television series. The NBC data management 
system uses eight separate databases. 

These data management systems, apart from the three 
preprogrammed applications noted above, do not come out of 
tbe box ready to go. In each instance more experienced users 
have been responsible for developing the DBMS into a DMS. 
However, these include an ex-fllm producer and an ex-police 
chief, suggesting that with Condor at least, the transition is not 
that difficult. 

A database management scheme has three principal parts : 
a forms generator, a database manager, and a report writer. 
Condor wins top marks for the first two. A failing grade for the 
built-in report writer becomes a top mark with the purchase of

Thou should know'st that life was doubly sweet 
in Stratford. Peacefully the Avon flow'd nearby, 
reflecting brightly the morning sun and the 
evening stars. England flourish'd in fine 
splendor, its citizens members of a far-flung 
empire. Royalty would oft come to view mine 
meagre scribblings come to life upon the stage. 

Amongst all this bounty, alas, there eixst'd the 
bane of Basic. Wherefore art the man who 
could'st master the mysteries of GOTOs, 
GOSUBs, and all sorts of other ill-manner'd 
constructions? How oft I labor'd with Basic, 
knowing full well the price to be paid in 
debugging. 

Yearn'd I then for the software tool to ease mine 
burden. A tool that would afford the ease of use 
of more base languages such as English. But 



then, time is a slave to no man, mine poverty was 
not eased. Forsooth, 'twas not until the 
introduction of the Program Writer/Reporter for 
thine Apple II that this burden could be lifted. 

This Program Writer/Reporter can'st do all 
manner of writing, though it's not yet been 
known to put pen to a play or sonnet. Know'st 
thou that this program can'st even create 
interactive files so data can flow from one to the 
other even as the Avon flows gently past mine 
place of leisure to another destiny. 

With this software 'tis possible even for Falstaff, 
that man of no serious purpose, to write code as 
good as a Budge. Shylock, he of the mean spirit, 
would'st give his money purse for such a tool as 
would'st make him as powerful as a Stone. 



Layman! Look your last at despair! Let Program 
Writer/Reporter write your code. Let not pride 
of authorship stand in thy way. Code by any 
other source will run as sweet.

Condor 20-R, a highly flexible report writer which provides for 
fixed as well as variable-length records. 

Condor lets the user adapt existing forms like an invoice or 
an order entry blank for use in a computerized business or lab- 
oratory system. The adaptation of existing forms makes it 
easier to create and to implement a computerized system — 
there is less for employees to learn and unlearn. 

Each form and each field on a form can be validated be- 
fore it is entered Into the database. Data entry clerks can't en- 
ter a letter when a number is required. They can't skip over 
fields that must be filled in. A field may be required to lie be- 
tween specified limits such as $1 to $5. The average time to 
compose a screen, even with cross checks and verifications on 
each field, is less than fifteen minutes. 

Condor will please the systems developer because of short 
development time, flexible command structure, compact data 
storage, and satisfied end users. It permits crashless data 
entry by relatively unskilled personnel, compact data storage 
with fewer disks to change, quick access to needed infor- 
mation, and flexible report formats. 

Sets of commands Include those for database creation and 
maintenance, information input and update, information 
processing and report writing, operation aids, interfaces, and 
utilities. 

Condor files are compact partly as a result of its relational 
nature. The use of two databases keeps files conveniently man- 
aged, yet they can be combined with a single command. 

Condor 20 is a big system that uses all the Apple's poten- 
tial. You'll need a CP/M SoftCard, a 16K RAM card, an eighty- 
column generator, and at least two disk drives. A hard disk Is 
recommended to get the most from Condor 20-2.

Bandits. By Tony and Benny Ngo. Pow! Paw! Pow! "Here 
comes another wave!" Pow! Pow! "Oh no! They're dropping 



napalm!" Pow! Pow! Pow! "Quick . . . shields up!" Pow! 
Pow! "Come back with that orange! Aargh . . , shields out! 

No! No! Aaarrgh! !" 

So ends another game of Bandits. 

Bandits is a variation of the age-old invaders-type game, 
but with enough new twists and innovations of Its own to make 
It one of the better of this genre — possibly the best. 

In Bandits, you are left to guard the supplies on our closest 
satellite, the moon. These supplies are grapes, oranges, 
wrenches, and a whole variety of other items. Every criminal 
in space is out to steal your goodies and disintegrate you In the 
process. At your disposal are five mobile laser g^uns per game, 
with an unlimited supply of ammunition and a limited amount 
of shield energy. Bonus guns are awarded every 5,000 points. 
Your shields should be used sparingly at first ; the game gets 
quite hectic as play progresses. A gauge at the bottom of the 
screen keeps you informed of your shield's remaining energy 
at all times. Shield energy is completely replenished with each 
new gun, and is slowly replenished during the life of each gun 
in sustained play. 

The game starts out simply enough. Phalanxes firing 
streams of bullets make several passes at you, either singly or 
in groups. Any of them you miss will steal your supplies that 
are stacked on the right of the screen, and return with them to 
their mothersliip at the upper left. If you succeed in blasting 
away the entire batch of marauders before they make off with 
your cherries, bonus points are awarded for the supplies 
saved. Then a whole new flight of baddies try their own unique- 
ly devious ways to put you under and continue their plunder. 
Some of these are centipede-like Torrents with napalm bombs, 
Carriers that drop bouncing balloons on you, and the deadly 
Menace with its highly accurate heat-seeking bullets. 

Bandits has twenty-eight levels of play, each with a differ- 
ent group of items to protect and a unique combination of ban- 
dits that go after your goods. This is where the game really gets 
frantic. With several different types of bandits attacking si- 
multaneously, wise shield use, strategy, and a keen eye with a 
laser cannon separate the pro from the novice.

Solar System Astronomy. By Mark Cross. This program is 
hard to define. It's more than an "introduction," but less than a 
complete course ; more than a textbook-on-disk, but less than a 
fully Interactive teaching program. It's rather like a series of 
Illustrated lectures — except that you read the "lecture" off the 
screen, rather than hearing it. 

As a rule, you get a picture of the planet and its two satel- 
lites, in hl-res color, filling the upper half of the screen. Below 
this is a block of text describing the planet — ^typically twenty or 
thirty words. When you have read that, press any key and the 
text will be replaced by a new paragraph, while the picture re- 
mains. The total amount of text is about 200 words. 

The Information Is nicely organized for teaching purposes, 
and it's presented one idea at a time. Also, some of the sec- 
tions use several pictures and/or simple animation to get their 
points across. All of this makes it easier to understand the ma- 
terial, and thus helps in learning it. 

The text presentation includes a couple of surprises. For 
one thing, it appears slowly — one character at a time, at about 
normal reading speed — accompanied by a series of ticks from 
the speaker to simulate the sound of typing. Tills is not as dis- 
tracting as you might expect, and in fact seems to add a kind of 
warmth to the program — a subliminal suggestion that, even 
though you are studying alone, the teacher is there with you. 

Also, the text is in mixed upper and lower case, just like a 
textbook — an unusual sight on the Apple screen. The program 
includes a special graphics driver, wiiich also permits inter- 
mixing text and grapiilcs ; thus labels and explanations can be 
included in the pictures. This flexibility makes for pictures 
which are easier to understand and teach more effectively 
than the usual Apple graphics. 

The program includes a section on each of the planets (the 
latest information available as of 1981) , the History of the So-

Cannonball Blitz. By Olaf Lubeck. The cover of the package of 
Cannonball Blitz features a soldier firmly ensconced on the tail 
of his cannon, joystick in hand, a Budweiser at his side. 

Despite what you might think, however, Cannonball isn't a 
shooting game. It's a combination of capture the flag, dodge 
ball, and ladder climbing. The resulting amalgam is highly 
entertaining. 

The object of the game is to capture enemy flags by scaling 
various heights. The first level is a set of sloping floors, com- 
plete with trap doors and springboards. You have a trio of 
characters trying to liberate the flag. You can control the little 
person with either joystick or keyboard (you can define the 
keys). 

The joystick button or space bar sends the character aloft. 
Why? Well, there are the bombs that roll down the slope after 
the giant soldier at the top kicks them. You must leap over the 
bombs or lose a character. The graphic representation of this 
bereavement is an unlucky acrobat sitting there with stars 
whirling about his head. 

Springboards are placed at various strategic points on the 
slopes. If you can position your character at the springboard 
before a bomb falls through a trap door, the resultant New- 
tonian principle of motion sends you up to the next level. 

After various adventures and mishaps, you'll finally reach 



the top level. Right above that is the flag. Your only chance to 
get it, however, is to catch a ride on a balloon that comes and 
goes. If you're on the top sloping level without a balloon, you 
must leap all the bombs the giant kicks your way until the bal- 
loon floats back up. 

When you capture the flag, you begin the next screen of 
play. This is a series of six level floors patrolled by malevolent 
cannons that can go up and down the ladders connecting the 
floors. The five upper floors each have two trap doors that are 
opened when your character runs over them. Two of these 
floors have little hammers that can only be used on those floors 
and will destroy the cannons. You must spring all five traps in 
a vertical row so that the giant soldier patrolling the top floor 
will fall through. 

If you avoid the cannons and the cannonballs, don't step 
through an open trap, and don't get stepped on, you'll capture 
the flag. The third level is much like the second, except that 
there are elevators to assist your ascent. 

Points are earned by jumping cannonballs on the first 
screen ; hitting a cannon with a hammer or opening a trap door 
on the second screen ; and hammering a cannon, jumping from 
platform to platform , and jumping from platform to elevator 
on the third screen. You'll earn bonus points for capturing the 
flag, and gamer an extra character after completing the sec- 
ond screen. 

There isn't any way to restart the game if you should lose 
your first galloper early on. It also takes a few moments to re-

DOUDLETIME PRINTER (D.P.) is on extremely thorough 
ond extensive package, which con easily pay for itself 
in a matter of weeks in computer time savings. 

Until now, whenever the Apple was outputting infor- 
mation to o printer, it was "out of commission" until the 
printing was done. Decouse most printers ore rather 
slow, this can mean a loss of use of the computer ranging 
5 to 10 minutes to on hour or more. 

D.P. now liberates your Apple from being "printer- 
bound" by allowing the computer to essentially do two 
things of once. With D.P. installed you'll be able to 
continue using many progroms in the "foreground" while 
the printer faithfully prints out the desired files in the 
"background". 

D.P. Is more than just a simple interrupt driven utility 
though. Over a year of development has gone into 
producing a complete and Integrated package with a 
wide vorief/ of functions and feofures. A few of these are: 



Prints BINARY, TEXT or APPLESOFT files with no con- 
versions necessary. All files ore printed directly from the 
diskette so very little internol computer memor/ is 
used, and there ore no restrictions on number or 
size of the documents printed, other than your system's 
disk capacity. 

• Files con be FORMATTED when desired to include 
margins, paging and even variable number of copies. 

• Files con be prioritized so that other users con odd 
their files to a diskette while printing is in progress. 
Urgent files can supercede eorlier files placed on 
the disk. 

• DOUDLETIME PRINTER is supplied with o special F8 
ROM (under special license from Apple Computer, 
Inc.) and on interrupt driver interface cord. Doth are 
simple to install by either end-user or dealer.

VisiPlot without having to retype the information manually. 

The program does this by converting suitably formatted 
text files into DIF files which can then be loaded into a model 
in the Visi program of your choice. The major constraint is 
that VC-Loader must have a text file as input, and these input 
files must be uniformly formatted or the troubles that arise 
will consume much more time than might be saved by losing 
the program. The files to be converted can be from a time- 
sharing system such as the Source or Dow Jones, reports from 
software packages that do not produce DIF files but that 
will save reports to disk as text files, or reports from other per- 
sonal computers in direct communication. Text files can be 
captured from time-sharing systems or other computers using 
communications programs such as VisiTerm or Data Cap- 
ture. 

The appearance of the program on the screen when booted 
is much like VisiCalc. The commands are also similar to Visi- 
Calc, using the / as the signal to the program that the next 
character is a command. The method of operation is to place a 
VisiCalc-type long cursor over the information that you wish to 
place into a single cell. You then hit return and the progrram 
accepts the digits marked by the cursor as a cell of infor- 
mation for insertion into your model. You then move to the 
next column of information and repeat this procedure until you 
have marked all the columns. You then issue a command to 
save the file and the program scans each line of your file and 
assigns the information in it to the relative model cell. 

There is also an automatic mode that attempts to define the 
positions across the model by using each encountered space as 
the cell marker. You may choose the occurrence of 1, 2, or 3 
contiguous spaces as a key. 

In downloading a group of Dow Jones stock prices and at- 
tempting to place them into a VisiCalc model, VC-Loader is 
able to take the fractions that Dow Jones uses in stock prices 
and convert them to decimals so that VisiCalc will treat them 
as values, not as labels. Were this not done, it would not be pos- 
sible to do any calculations with the information. 

The program's error handling is quite good— nothing, ap- 
parently, can crash the program. At worst, you could make a 
mess of the file in memory and have to reload and start over. 

The documentation is quite sparse (5Vi pages) , so if the 
user isn't proficient with VisiCalc the potential for trouble 
abounds. Additionally, the user registration card is printed on 
the back of a page that has information on it that most users 
would want to retain. 

As far as customer support goes, the program comes on a 
protected disk without a backup ; a backup is available by mail 
for $15. This is a policy that is subject to question. 

In terms of cost, time, and effort, VC-Loader is probably 
suitable only for the user who deals with large volumes of well 
formatted information.

Guardian. By Tom and Jerry. Wanted: heroes and high 
nooners to play suspenseful home-arcade space oater. Blaz- 
ing ray gun combat against creeping aliens that close in on 
you, move when you move, and strike with uncanny accuracy. 

In a startling departure from its previous game form. Con- 
tinental Software has leapt into the rabid competition for 
home-arcade bestsellerdom. Their hi-res, fast-moving, 
smoothly animated entry is Guardian. 

This episode of the Guardian saga is a blast-and-escape 
race against time down six progressively lethal levels. Guard- 
ianship of the Emerald of Syrinx has been entrusted to you. Af- 
ter an optional briefing, it's your one man against the mon- 
sters, with only one minute per sector to gun a path through 
them and get to the next level. A flashing striped square that 
appears in alternating comers of the screen is your only ticket 
out of each maze. 

The first two levels of the game, five and six, are harmless 
in themselves ; but three and four get lethal, as the walls are as 
deadly to the touch as the creatures that are corralling you 
within them. In levels two and three you barely stand a ghost of 



a chance — the walls will disappear in five seconds and you are 
in the dark, with only a memory of the maze to gtiide you. 

Each sector opens with menacing munchers circling a sim- 
ple maze, waiting to close in for the kill. From the moment you 
get off your first shot, the grungy mob (two alien threshers, a 
robot, two insectoids, and a yo-yo) begins crunching, slurping, 
wiggling, and oozing their way into your heart. Cute as they 
are, they are even more dangerous — the threshers can ooze 
right through the walls. If one of the deadly denizens gets so 
much as one dot too close, you're kaput; flat on your back, 
kicking your legs, dying one of the hammiest deaths in game- 
dom. You have two resurrections per game ; each one puts you 
right back into the center of menace. 

There is one odd piece of logic to Guardian : If you happen 
to kill all the aliens on any level as well as make it to the tele- 
portation square, you are returned to that same level against 
a full deck of attackers with only the remainder of your orig- 
inal match time left. So remember to leave a monster or two 
behind you before you split. One would think there would be a 
point bonus for such a feat of total demolition as well as es- 
cape, but that's not the case in the dungeons. 

Guardian defaults to joystick but can be played on key- 
board as well. Nine keys are needed to maneuver and nine 
more are needed to fire ; nimble fingers are advised. Normal 
or expert play modes are offered. Expert play will require sev- 
eral hours to master. Normal play is fast enough fun for the 
average gunslinger. Be ready to bite the bullet when you boot 
this one, partner.

3, and be on your way. But that still runs into some hefty 
dollars. Hmm . . . what to do? 

At last, the solution is here. Electric Duet allows the user to 
produce two-part harmony with no hardware. This concept is 
surpassed only by the superb sound quality of the program. 
The demo files included on the disk, which range from Bach's 
"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" to Scott Joplin's "The Enter- 
tainer," demonstrate the possible musical variations one can 
create with the program. 

Input of musical notes is slow, but simple. You can either 
type in the notes directly (4,3G# = quarter note, G-sharp in 
the third octave) , or there is a "play" mode which transforms 
the Apple keyboard into a quasi-piano keyboard. In this latter 
mode, when you press the piano key desired, the editor tells 
you what the note is and enters it into your composition. Duet 
does not allow you to use the repeat bar as you would in sheet 
music, which means if you wish to repeat a phrase or a strain, 
you must input it twice. Needless to say, file listings can get 
pretty lengthy. 

After the notes are entered, you need to adjust the length of 
each note (quarter, eighth, sixteenth, et cetera). Once you do 
this, you have yourself a nice piece in two-part harmony. 

One of the most powerful features of the program is its 
transposition ability. A single command will change your 
musical file to another key, anywhere from a half-step (F to 
F#, for example) to a whole octave or more. In addition to note 
transposition. Duet will also adjust the tempo. One advantage 
of the transposition command is that it allows you to compose 
in a familiar key, like B-flat, and then move it to a more diffi- 
cult one. If you're the type who has trouble with more than four 
flats or sharps, you'll find the transposition command a defi- 
nite plus! 

Duet saves your pieces as binary files, which allows you to 
insert one musical file into another or use them in your own 
programs by bloading them to memory and then calling them 
when desired. 

In addition to two-part harmony. Duet allows you to use 
several different voices in your compositions. Six voices are 
possible; however, four are normally used on the Apple. This is 
especially useful to create an aural illusion of more than just 
two parts. Some of the jukebox pieces that come with the pro- 
gram utilize this feature well. "Jesu," for example, changes 
voices when moving from one phrase to another, giving the im- 
pression that it is adding two more parts, rather than just 
changing tonal quality. While enjoying this demo file, you will 
swear E. Power Biggs is playing Bach in the Thomaskirche 
right from your very own Apple. 

The program's price would be reasonable if its features 
stopped here. They don't. Lutus also gives you a way (if you're 
creative enough) to insert accelerandos and decelerandos for 
variation of tempo within a piece. Duet can also differentiate 
up to fourteen different pitches between half-steps in the low- 
est octave (fewer in the upper octaves), which makes glis- 
sandos and "sliding" possible. By using techniques described 
in the manual, you can also produce fuller, richer tones, espe- 
cially in the bass, by combining two notes just a fraction apart 
from each other. 

There are a few minor shortcomings in Duet. Every note 
must be entered in terms of the shortest note at that point. In 
other words, if you have four eighth notes in the melodic line 
accompanied by a half note in the lower line, the half note must 
be written as four consecutive eighth notes as well. However, 
Duet cannot figure out whether you want four eighth notes or 
one half note, and therefore reads them as written. The result 
is that instead of getting one continuous note, you get a "half 
note" interrupted by three quick breaks in between. The same 
is true when you do want several consecutive notes at the same 
pitch; the notes are not separated and sound the same as a 
long note. 

A second deficiency is that although Duet allows you to edit 
and insert notes within the file, finding the trouble spot is a 
trouble in itself. Unless you can look at the file listing and know 
where you are by identifying the notes (and remember long 



notes sometimes look like several short ones) , this is difficult. 
What the program allows you to do is play each note as you 
scroll down the listing. This makes finding your place a little 
easier, but you will be tempted to wish the listing scrolled by 
while the piece played, so you could see where any errors oc- 
curred. 

Another unwanted feature of Duet is the presence of a 
piercing, high-pitched carrier frequency, like that of a televi- 
sion set, that emanates from the speaker during the playing 
from the jukebox. It is negligible while music is present, but 
during the rests it can be annoying. 

The program comes with an easy-to-follow seventeen -page 
manual that leads you through in a friendly manner. Though 
the backup is made on the reverse side of the disk (who ever 
heard of the sun melting one side of a disk?) , replacements of 
damaged disks are available for a nominal fee. 

Paul Lutus has given us the pleasure of hearing two-part 
music, sans hardware. Electric Duet is a utility no Apple 
music hobbyist should pass up. If you can't afford a music 
board, this is definitely the way to go.

Rendezvous. By Wesley Huntress, Ph.D. For those who 
watched the Enterprise shuttle flights and thought, "Why 
that's so easy, even I could do it! " now is your chance to prove 
it. Edu-Ware has once again introduced an incredible educa- 
tional tool, titled Rendezvous. Although a lot of fun at times, it 
is definitely not an arcade game. The program starts off at 
launch and you have to achieve orbit around the earth. If it is 
not stable, you burn up after one revolution. Once you have 
mastered this relatively easy task, then you have the tedious 
task of matching orbit with the space station. This is not easy, 
as space is large, and both of you are small. Subtle changes in 
angle of thrust and the amount of thrust over many orbits 
bring wide variations in position. A lot of patience and a good

grounding in basic astrophysics (trig will do) is very helpful. 

When you have gotten the shuttle into the same part of 
space as the station, then you enter phase three, the approach. 
Utilizing either the keyboard or a joystick, you must maneu- 
ver to within two kilometers of the station and reduce your 
speed to twenty meters per second or less (almost drifting). 
The fourth and most difficult phase is the actual docking in the 
station landing bay. On "Battlestar Galactica," it looks so easy 
when the fighters swoop full blast into the tiny bay opening. Just 
try it ! The approach corridor for the space station is a cylin- 
der 32 meters in diameter and 42 meters long. The shuttle must 
be in exact sync with the station in all three axes, with no side- 
wise drift, and matching speed. Only when all these conditions 
are met and the shuttle is in the corridor do the docking doors 
open. 

Now the real fun begins! You must bring the shuttle to "dis 
tance=0" from the hangar; the heading, pitch, and bank mus' 
not exceed two degrees ; and the shuttle must be within two me 
ters of the approach line. Otherwise you crash into the station 
If you can really do all this, the program will grade your per 
formance and assign you a rank from Swab to Fleet Admiral

to do with each of their fingers.

Quest for the Holy Grail. By Thome D. Harris in and Mark 
Ben Hattier. This is a fantasy adventure game in the tradition 
of Wizardry and Hellfire Warrior. It's much simpler than those 
two and in many ways not as good, but it has some nice 
features of its own. It also has one great advantage over near- 
ly all games of this kind — but we'll come to that later. 

The scenario of the game is the classic quest story: You 
create a character (random numbers determine his bravery, 
fame, virtue, wisdom, and wealth) and send him to visit 
seven different monasteries scattered over a map of Britain, 
seeking the Holy Grail and having adventures. Before starting 
on his quest, your hero can hire various companions (if he can 
afford them) : a friar, a barber (skilled in the healing arts) , a 
jester, and a minstrel. 

Some of the monasteries to be visited hold clues to the lo- 
cation of the Grail, which will help your hero in his search. 
However, the monasteries also contain hazards of various 
kinds (including a foxy lady or two) , which can reduce one or 
more of the hero's characteristics. Also, your friar may 
choose to join the monastery rather than stay with your 
group — which leaves your party one man short. 

The monasteries are separated by dark and dangerous for- 
est paths teeming with killer rabbits, man-eating trees, and 
other nasties — including an occasional fire-breathing dragon. 
You can lose party members here, too. Or your hero himself 
can be killed — the screen displays the ominous warning, "Your 
powers are failing. ..." But if he has a magic potion, and a 
companion to administer it, he may yet survive to reach the 
next monastery. 

On the other hand, if you manage to defeat a monster, some 
of your characteristics may improve — particularly fame — and 
you may also find a chest with a few gold pieces in it, improv- 
ing your wealth. 

The scenario of the game is very good: it provides lots of 
action and quite a few surprises, and it all fits together smooth- 
ly. There's not much in the way of graphics — most scenes are 
described rather than pictured — but the descriptions are good 
enough to make it work. 

The "play" of the game — the mechanics of playing it in 
terms of what actions you can take in any given situation — is 
less satisfactory. You are always offered a choice of actions, 
but your selection often doesn't affect the result of the en- 
counter. Even if you make the same choice in a given situation 
every time that situation comes up, the results may vary un- 



predictably: win one time and lose the next, with no apparent 
pattern. It can be frustrating. 

But you can fix that. And now we come to the great advan- 
tage mentioned earlier: this game is not copy-protected, bless 
Mr. Harris and company. As it says on the cover, this game is 
"fully listable and modifiable." 

So if you ever get tired of playing it from the outside, you 
can open it up and play around with the insides ! Custom-tailor 
it to your own preferences, or use it as a starting point to build 
your own game. Or just learn from it. 

If you're really into fantasy games, you shouldn't miss this

Fly Wars. By Duane Later. Fly Wars releases the spider in all 
of us in a home-arcade game that requires both reflexes and 
foresight. At first the game seems like a throwaway, but given 
half a chance it will grow on you. The basic idea is to trap fly- 
fighters in your web. Each time you destroy one, a caterpillar 
appears. Trap them to produce a cocoon. Finally, you must 
push the cocoon to the top of the screen, where it explodes in a 
cascade of points. As you rack up points, the action speeds up, 
making it harder at each of the eight levels to trap either the 
flies or the caterpillars. 

To make life interesting, a can of Raygunite bug spray ap- 
pears with increasing frequency on the sides of the screen, dis- 
pensing bursts of noxious vapors lethal to your octopedal alter 
ego. And then there's a web- munching beetle that can make 
your life exceedingly difficult. Finally, in a touch of ultimate 
silliness, caterpillars revert to their true terrorist nature by 
hurling an occasional bomb at you. 

As the spider, your only weapon is your web. You can string 
it up or travel without it. Should one screen get too cluttered 
with strands, you can clear it by running off the edge with your 
spinneret turned off. The beetle and the bug spray are always 
deadly, and all you can do is try to evade them — ^not always a 
simple task. So you reside in the middle of a food chain; 
stronger than some, prey to others. An unenviable position, but 
far from hopeless. The key is planning ahead. Preparation in 
the earlier, slower levels pays off when things get hectic — ^if 
you survive that long. Although you have three spiders per 
game, the death of one clears the screen of trapped victims. 

After the disappointment of some of Sirius's last few 
games. Fly Wars is encouraging. It may slip by unnoticed in 
the plethora of new releases, but it deserves better than that. 
Perhaps its 3-D cover will catch the buyer's eye and the news 
that this one plays well — very well — will spread. 

Fly Wars is addicting without being frustrating — and that's 
nothing to swat at these days.

Eliminator. By John Anderson. In the grand tradition of De- 
fender, your space ship weaves and bobs through the sky 
above your planet firing at a variety of alien enemies. Unlike 
Defender, however, in the Apple version of this game you are 
not defending anyone. There is nothing on the planet that the 
aliens are trying to pick up. All the action takes place in space, 
and there is plenty of it for the action lovers. There are ten 
levels of intensity, which are selectable at the beginning. You 
can also change levels by surviving the previous level. 

An interesting innovation is the introduction of a real time 
clock that regulates how much time you have on each level. 
There are fifteen waves of aliens per level, so your score is de- 
pendent on the number shot down in the allotted time. To add to 
the fun, forward and background scrolling is possible. There- 
fore, the aliens can reverse direction off screen to make sneak 
attacks. 

Another novelty is the launching of missiles from the alien 
ships. If sixteen of these missiles hit your ship, your screens are 
destroyed. Not only do you have to avoid the aliens' deadly fire, 
at times the screen is so littered with missiles that it looks like a 
blizzard. 

Eliminator is a challenging entry-level arcade game that

Trailblazer. By Zeta Systems. Metagaming, one of the major 
forces in the role-playing game world, has made its debut in 
the microcomputer field. Trailblazer is Metagaming's highly 
successful interstellar trading and mercantile empire-build- 
ing game. It has been developed and marketed for the Apple 
by ZSI and was introduced at the May Applefest in Boston. 

One can sharpen one's trading strategies in the solo mode, 
but it was primarily designed as a multiplayer game. Each of 
the four players is given limited capital, a home office on 
Earth, and a branch office on another planet. Each round of 
the game is divided into three modules. The first module is the 
auctioning of trade items, with designated products of each 
planet going to the highest bidder. On different planets each 
product is worth different values. These values shift with sup- 
ply, demand, and advertising. A maater strategy can be de- 
stroyed because a competitor beat you to a planet and glutted 
the market. Thus, the successful trader must devise a strategy 
of buying low on one planet and immediately, on the next turn, 
selling high on another planet. Easier said than done! Over- 
head costs and taxes make this very difficult. The cost of 
maintaining fleets of scout and transport ships and supporting 
new offices can rapidly eat up moderate profits. 

Once all the buying is done, the ships are allocated into 
fleets and the cargo for each is loaded. Then the fleets are as- 
signed destinations. Lone scouts are ordered into the void to 
discover new planets, which bring in hefty cash bonuses. 
Fleets can sometimes get lost in hyperspace and disappear 
forever. 

Amidst all the text, there is one nice hi-res animated pic- 
ture that shows your ship arriving at a planet and a shuttle 
going down to the surface. In the second module, the cargo is 
unloaded and sold on the planet. Within the third module, fleets 
are reorganized, offices are opened and closed and the ad- 
vertising budgets allocated. Finally, a profit-and-loss state- 
ment for the round is shown. At the end of each round a buUe- 



} 149 

tin is issued from the Free Traders Association which pro- 
claims the top trader of the round. The game can be played for 
a preset number of rounds or until one player has bankrupted 
all his opponents. 

Metagaming has a fantastic catalog — let's hope more of 
their games will be adapted for the Apple. Rumors that ZSI 
will bring out Fantasy Trip in hi-res graphics surfaced at Ap- 
plefest, much to game-players' delight.

S.A.G.A. #1-12. By Scott Adams. Certainly one of the cleverest 
marketing gambits of the year has been Adventure Interna- 
tional's revamping of the S.A.G.A. (Scott Adams Graphic Ad- 
ventures). One of the growing number of companies to utilize 
the exceptionally diverse graphic programs of Penguin's Mark 
Pelczarski, A.I. is re-releasing all twelve of the famous Scott 
Adams text adventures with hi-res graphics. 

Obviously a tremendous amount of marketing research 
was done in preparing S.i4.Gr..A. for re-release. The final prod- 
uct line has many sought-after features. Each S.A.G.A. sup- 
ports the Votrax voice synthesizer, giving you an adventure that 
talks. The program also supports lower case and allows for 
the graphic mode to be turned off for speed in playing. The disk 
is double-sided, which allows hi-res pictures utilizing a special 
palette of over one hundred colors. 

A.I.'s new commitment to hi-res graphic adventuring 
sounds the death knell for pure text adventure games. The 
mighty tide of the consumer market has so dictated, and A.I. 
has been perceptive enough to try to ride the crest of the wave.

'7 told ye then ye'd not come unscarred from the temple of 
Apshai. Indeed," he chuckled, "ye've some fine new notches 
on ycr armor. " 

"Why do we waste time on this knave, Eleazar?" blurted 
the priestess. "Patience, Hathor, patience, " the grizzled lord 
murmured. "Sayifom can tell us more of the knight of dia- 
monds than most. " 

The drinker choked on his mighty gulp of ale. "Knight 
of ... . " He looked at the trio through one gimlet eye. "So, ye're 
about that, are ye? The temple of Apshai wasn't enough. Ye 
had to test the wizardry of Werdna in the mad overlord's 
dimgeon. Now the knight of diamonds. Pshah, ye're mad." 

The rasp of stone on steel stopped his mouth. "Yer tongue is 
too sharp, ancient. Perhaps ye'd like to have some of it shaved 
smoother?" the voice of the dwarf Oden purred gently as he 
added another touch to the edge of his sword. 

"Nay, I meant nothin' by it, " sneered the oldster. "I used 
to be a hero once meself. " He cackled with mirth and drained 
his ale. 

"Enough of this blather," said armored Eleazar from his 
spot against the wall, right thumb endlessly polishing the gem 
on the hilt of his unsheathed sword. "Tell us of the knight of 
diamonds. " 

"Ah, well, my throat's a bit dry for all that talking," said 
Sanfom. He searched his pockets without success, then 
grinned at Eleazar, who gave a chill smile and ordered a fresh 
round. After a gulp from afresh flagon, Sanfom began to talk. 
"Ye're all experienced, better than thirteenth level, from what 
ye did in Wizardry. Ye must be, to enter the city of Llylgamyn 

"Years ago, the city was protected by the staff of Gnilda. 
Nothing from outside — neither magic nor force of arms — could 
disturb the city as long as it held that staff Men and women of 
good will could come and go as they pleased. 

"Ah, but its creator never thought of the enemy within. A 
traitor of Llylgamyn sold himself to dark forces. He seized the 
staff and slaughtered — he thought — the entire royal family. It 
was a dark deed, darkly done. "

Shaking his head, Sanfom drank yet another draught. 
"What the traitor didn't know was that two youngsters of the 
royal family escaped through passages knoum only to the fami- 
ly and a few trusted fighters. I was one. 

"Ye scoff, " Sanfom spat at the dwarf, "yet 'tis true. After 
the slaughter, the traitor was cocksure he'd destroyed the 
family. The young prince and princess, loith my help and that of 
a few others, recovered the armor of the knight of diamonds, a 
hero the traitor thought was but legend. 

"With the armor, and the staff of Chiilda, the prince led us 
against the traitor," Sanfom' s youthful fingers danced in the 
air as he continued. 

"We others battled the forces of the dark lords while the 
young prince and the traitor struggled. Well, the traitor fell at 
last, but his dying curse destroyed the prince and the castle. 
Those of us left alive searched for days but found nothing. 

"Now again the city is threatened. Gnilda's staff is there in 
one of the six broken corridors under what's left of the castle. 
The armor of the knight of diamonds is there as well, and — it's 
rumored — can defend itself better than any warrior. " 

"Indeed, " said Eleazar, "it needs that strength if it is to de- 
fend itself against the strange species of beasts and vermin 
said to be there. Well, I grow bored of the usual haunts. I have 
a band of fighters, priests, thieves, mages, and other magic 
users who're lusting for more adventure. We go to 
Llylgamyn. " 

"I would go with ye, " said the one-eyed figure. "I know 
those narrow halls. For example, only three fighters may go 
abreast. Wise leaders post magic users behind this iron front 
wall. " 

"Ye'd be naught but a nuisance," sneered the dwarf. 

"Let me buy the next round of ale, and I'll prove ye wrong. " 
Again Sanfom searched his robes, this time successfully. He 
paid the serving man with a peculiar iron coin. 

"Odd, " said Odin, peering at the coin. "That's dwarf gelt. I 
see little of that above our lands. Where'd ye come by it?" 

Sanfom laughed. "From yer pouch. I stole it as I talked. " 

With his left hand, the dwarf reached up deep inside his iron 
breastplate where he carried his pouch for safety. 

"Why you old 

His sword roared through the air and smashed the chair 
Sanfom had been sitting on. From behind him came the man's 
voice, stronger and quieter. 

"After the prince died, I became a thief. He and I were like 
brothers, and the city held naught for me with him dead. But I 
see my death now dimly, and I would retum. I will do so as yer 
friend and compatriot, or alone — it matters little to me. I'll die 
in the place I was bom. 

"I'll drink in the adventurer's inn again, have Boltar's son 
Boltac sell me potions, maybe even leave a few coppers (mine 
or not) at the temple of Cant. I will retum to Llylgamyn with or 
without ye. " 

Eleazar stood and placed his hand on the dwarf's shoulder 
to calm him. 

"You can come with us, and welcome. But first, retum 
Odin's pouch to him." 

"That?" laughed Sanfom. "It's back inside his iron draw- 
ers, as safe as it was before. It's only a wee bit lighter to pay 
for our drink on leaving. ..."

One of the enjoyable things about traveling is the opportuni- 
ty it affords to browse in multifarious computer stores. Even 
if you live in a big city and have a large selection of Apple 
dealers, the grass always seems Just a bit greener — especially 
if you're visiting places like California or Massachusetts that 
are centers of micro activity. If you find something that looks 
useful and the price isn't too high, you probably buy it; after all, 
you rationalize, the dealers back home might not have it. 

That's not completely a rationalization. There's so much 
software available that no one dealer can carry it all. And 
some of the programs, such as the various VisiCalc peripher- 
als, are of interest only to owners of other programs, so a 
dealer who doesn't stock the original won't stock the peripher- 
als either. Then, too, some dealers tend to specialize in games 
or business applications or even in hardware to the exclusion of 
software. So it's a good idea to buy interesting programs to 
have on hand in case you run into a problem where you might 
need their help. 

Flight of Fancy. Just imagine the goodies you might col- 
lect over two or three years as a traveling computer en- 
thusiast. There's one from a Los Angeles computer store that 
lets you turn the command save into init so that anybody who 
tries to copy one of your programs with a load and save will 
zap the disk. There's an out-of-print personal finance package 
from Chicago that begins erasing disks only after you've en- 
tered eighteen months of transactions, including all your per- 
sonal and business checks, credit cards, and department store 
charges. There's a musical pitch ear-training package, de- 
signed to run on an obscure synthesizer, found in a barrel in a 
Cincinnati computer store with a sign saying, "Only $7.50 each. 
Even if they won't run, you've got another disk." 

Then there's the one designed to scroll listings slowly page 
by page, clearly designed for people who haven't heard of con- 
trol-S. The fact that it was only $14.95 at a store on Convoy 
Street in San Diego makes it less annoying that it never leaves 
the shelf. From a computer store on Lexington Avenue in New 
York came a package that lets you draw a series of lines on the 
screen and then play these as sound pulses through the speaker 
to create sound effects. Surely, it'll come in handy someday. 

In brief, in just one small part of your software library, you 
might find two graphics packages; three personal finance 
packages (one that erases disks) ; four regression programs 
(including one home made), two, three, or four programs that 
tell the starting address and length of binary files, and who 
knows how many phone number lists, none of which will sort 
the names alphabetically. 

They're taking up space in the drawer, and they're tying up 



disks that you could use for other things, but you won't get rid 
of them. A good utility program is too valuable. 

Back to Earth. Some of the more useful utility programs 
don't cost a thing — once you have your system — because 
they're included on your system master. By now you're 
familiar with Copy and Copy a, right? The first is listed in the 
catalog as an Integer program, so it must be used for copying 
other Integer programs, while the second, which is in Apple- 
soft, is for copying floating point files, correct? And, since an 
object file is another name for machine lang^iage file, the third 
copy program on the disk, Copy. oh j (a binary file) , must be for 
copying machine language programs, mustn't it? 

Nope. Either of the first two programs will copy any file 
that is copiable by normal means, and the one written in the 
Basic language that your machine knows is the one you have to 
use. When you list one of these two, you realize that the third is 
the machine language program that does most of the actual 
copying and is called from the appropriate Basic program. 

But, if you've spent some time trying to find the Instructions 
that would tell you how to use these programs for copying indi- 
vidual binary files without specifying their starting address and 
length, you're not alone. 

You've probably also run across FID. The instructions are 
in your DOS Manual and are quite clear. In addition to dupli- 
cating only those files you select by name (unlike Copy and 
Copy a, which transfer the entire disk, bug^ and all), FID 
makes it a tiny bit easier to lock, unlock, or delete files than 
does DOS by itself. Similarly, Muffin is well documented in the 
manual. This is the one that takes thlrteen-sector 3.2 disks and 
upgrades them to sixteen-sector 3.3 disks. Not on the system 
master but available at your dealer if you ever need it (very 
unlikely) is Niffum, which downgrades files. 

Dog Bites DOS. Unfortunately, not all the utility programs 
on your system master are mentioned in the DOS Manual. For 
example, if your dog's just chewed up the basics disk you use 
to boot those old thlrteen-sector disks, you first kick the dog, 
second kick yourself for being too lazy to muffin them, and 
third insert your system master and type brun BootlS (note — 
no space between "Boot" and "13"). You can now boot 3.2 
disks. 

Suppose you're writing a program and discover that you 
need to put a twenty-line insert between lines 300 and 310. You 
could use a subroutine, but this is considered a very inelegant 
solution — almost a solecism — for a routine that's called only 
once per run. Instead, you remember that your system master 
has two programs entitled Renumber and Renumber Instruc- 
tions. The first is very useful; the second is incomplete and

confusing. The first allows you to renumber any or all lines in 
your Basic program and will automatically renumber in in- 
crements of five, ten, thirty-seven, or whatever you want. 

Unfortunately, if you run the instructions you'll have to 
scroll through sixteen screen pages. If you print them, you'll 
have six 8V2-inch by 11-inch pages with "Press space for 
more, esc to restart" messing up the printout three times on 
each page. When you look through them, you find that the pro- 
gram also contains supplementary programs to merge two Ap- 
plesoft programs and to convert ROM and RAM Applesoft pro- 
grams from one version to the other. It then has seven pages of 
error messages. 

Nowhere do the instructions tell you In which order to load 
your program and the utility that renumbers It. 

Better Yet. If all you want to do is renumber, forget the in- 
structions and go through the following very brief tutorial. 
First type the program and save it on a disk. 

3 HOME 

19 PRINT "APPLES" 

27 PRINT "AND" 

32 PRINT "ORANGES" 

39 PRINT "DRIVE" 

1099 PRINT "ME" 

55000 PRINT "BANANAS!" 

Got it saved? Okay. Now insert your system master and 
type run Renumber. Ignore the summary instructions and hit 
return two or three times. You should see the usual blinking 
cursor. Now reinsert the disk you saved this little program on 
and load the program by name (what did you name it?) . Type 
d (that's shift-6) . Wait a second until the cursor returns. Type 
list. You should find the lines renumbered by tens beginning 
with 10. This is the default setting. If you want these line num- 
bers, resave the program on a disk. Saving is not automatic 
with this utility. 

Suppose you want to renumber only lines 32 through 1099. 
Start tells the program which old line you want to start with 
and end tells it which old line to end with. First tells it what the 
first new number is to be. Inc sets the increments between line 
numbers. To renumber lines 32 through 1099 by hundreds be- 
ginning with number 1000, type: 

& FIRST 1000, START 32, END 1099, INC 100 

These commands can be in any order and must be separated 
by commas. For any that you omit, default values take over; 
the default values start with your first program line, end with 
the last, and renumber by tens beginning with ten. If this is 
what you want, and you probably will until you get to the sub- 
routines, just type the ampersand. 

Switcheroonle. Also note that Basic sorts the new line num- 
bers in the usual way, so that you can really garble a program 
if you goof and accidentally give some old high-numbered lines 
new numbers that are lower than some you didn't change. Sup- 
pose you intended to renumber a subroutine presently at 500 
from 1000 and up by tens and planned to type d Start 39, First 
1000. You get as far as & START 39 when the phone rings, and 
you hit return by mistake. GrO ahead and do it. Can you im- 
agine trying to straighten out a thousand-line program after 
something like that? So, save the original under its own name 
until you have checked the revised version. 

The important thing to note, and this is something that the 
instructions omit, is that you must first run Renumber and 
then, after you hit return a couple of times, enter or load your 
program, which Renumber prompts by showing the usual 
blinking cursor. Then, when you type d and the optional param- 
eters, whatever program you just loaded will be renum- 
bered. If you load your program before Renumber, running 
the utility will wipe it out of memory. If you run your program 
after loading it, you'll wipe out Renumber. Remember, even 
though it appears that you've regained control after you've run 
Renumber, Renumber is running the whole time and your pro- 
gram, until saved, is really only input data; if you hit reset or 
use maxfiles, you'll destroy this program. 



Dupes Your Digits. Two other useful utility programs on 
your system master are catalogued under the names Make 
Text and Retrieve Text. As you probably know by now, text 
files allow programs to control your machine using exactly the 
same commands you would use from the keyboard. If you 
want to call for the catalog in a Basic program, you can only do 
so in a roundabout way: 

100 D$ = CHR$(4): PRINT D$; "CATALOG" 

To call for it from a text file, you type simply catalog with no 
quotes or line number. 

The drawback, however, is that text files must be created 
by Basic programs, which is a bit complicated because each 
program must first open the file, then write in it, and later 
close it. Make Text is a utility that does this automatically. To 
see how it works, insert your system master and load Make 
Text. Save it on a disk that's not write protected. Do the same 
with Retrieve Text. Then run Make Text. When asked for the 
first line, type catalog. That's all. If you put a line number at 
the beginning, it'll think you're writing a Basic program and 
later on will balk. Hit return twice, and the prompt will ask for 
a file name. Type show. catalog . The command to run a text 
file is exec. Type exec show. catalog , and you should see the 
catalog if the disk is still in your drive. 

Retrieve Text is a utility program that allows you to see the 
contents of a text file. It's the equivalent of list, and its internal 
instructions are clear. Try it now with your text file named 
Show.Catalog. 

Dust Collectors. The last utilities on your system master 
are Chain, which allows you to run a second Applesoft pro- 
gram without zeroing out the first one's variables, and Master 
Create, which is now obsolete. This one reorganizes the files on 
your disk so that, no matter what size machine they were 
saved from, they will load and run on any other size from 16K 
to 48K. Since the chances of running into a 16K machine that 
hasn't been upgraded are almost nil, you'll probably never use

it. If you need to, the instructions are in the manual, as are 
those for Chain. 

Those are the utility programs that come with each system. 
Computer stores from Lexington Avenue to Convoy Street 
offer many more, some of which may prove useful to you. Here 
are just a few that may make your life a bit easier. 

Xlister; on Utility City from Beagle Bros (4316 Sierra Vista, 
San Diego, CA 92103; 714-296-6400), lists an Applesoft program 
with each line as many columns long as your printer can print. 
It prints each statement on a separate line, Indents those lines 
between each /or and its next, and marks those on the same line 
following an if-then. Best of all, it lists hidden control char- 
acters. This one makes analyzing somebody else's programs 
almost a joy. 

Zoom Graphics, from Phoenix Software (64 Lake Zurich 
Drive, Lake Zurich, XL 60047 ; 312-438-4850) , allows you to take a 
picture from either hi-res screen, enlarge it to almost any size, 
rotate it ninety degrees if you want, change Its vertical and hor- 
izontal proportions, and print it on a wide variety of printers; 
and Graphtrix, published by Data Transforms (616 Washing- 
ton Street, Suite 106, Denver, CO; 303-832-1501) , lets you mix hi- 
res graphics and text on the same printed page by converting 
text entered from the keyboard to hi-res characters identical 
with those of text mode. 

Apple Writer, by Apple Computer (10260 Bandley Drive, 
Cupertino, CA 95014; 408-996-1010), is a good beginning text 
editor. It's old, and it won't do directly a lot of things other 
word processors will do, such as display lower case on the 
screen, underline, print superscripts and subscripts, and send 
control commands to the printer. But it has one overwhelming 
advantage If you're apt to use your word processor a lot : It's 
copiable. Although you may never have a problem getting a 
blown disk replaced, it's good to avoid the ten days or so you 
might be without your word processor if it did crash. A simple 



Copya backup takes care of this eventuality. 

And if Apple Writer is the route you take, here's the service 
road to take with it. Brlllig Systems (10270 Fern Pool Court, 
Burke, VA 22015; 703-323-1339) publishes a software peri- 
pheral called Apple Writer Extended that overcomes the un- 
derlying limitation of Apple Writer and provides some very 
useful file conversion programs. Among these, perhaps the 
handiest are those programs that convert Applesoft files, Ap- 
ple Writer files, and text files to any one of the other types and 
at the same time change all upper-case letters to lower case or 
vice versa if desired. This allows you to write a demonstration 
program In Applesoft, run It and debug it, and then, without 
risking the Introduction of new typing errors, convert it into the 
Apple Writer format to be included in a manuscript. 

Innumerable other utilities exist to make using Apples 
easier, many specialized to particular interests. If you get into 
programming, you'll discover a score of utilities intended to 
smooth and speed the creation of new software. 

Down the Garden Path. The best way to learn about the po- 
tential of your computer is to try to make it do something. 
We'll get a good start on this next month when we enter an Ap- 
plesoft program that creates a special garden and, along the 
way, introduces a few commands and concepts not covered in 
the Applesoft tutorial.

The High-Resoliition Color Monitor 

for Apple II 




Amdek's new Color-ll monitor with DVM interface board 



No video monitor has ever combined Apple II compoti- 
bility with exceptional performance like the new 13" 
Color-ll monitor from Amdek. 

Color-ll features our optional new DVM peripheral board 
for easy interfacing with your Apple II. And look at the 
other top-of-the-line features Color-ll offers: 

• RGB, TTL input for high resolution graphics. 

• 80 X 24 character display capability (with expansion 
card by Vydec). 

• 560 (H) X 260 (V) resolution. 

• Molded-in carrying handle for easier portability. " 

• Front-mounted controls for faster fine-tuning. 

So if you want to get the most from your Apple II 
system, get the "most" monitor. Ask your dealer about 
Amdek's new Color-ll monitor with the optional DVM 
interface board. 



What is DVM? The DVM, or "Digital Video Multiplexor," 
is a low cost interface that allows the Apple II computer 
to be used with an RGB monitor, such as our Color-ll. 

Amdek's DVM is software programmable to allow trans- 
parent operation, and is parallel with existing Apple 
text and graphic modes. Three of its channels are used to 
multiplex the existing Apple text, low resolution and high 
resolution graphics. The 4th channel allows the use of an 
80 character line video board. 

Our DVM is also color channel software programmable, 
enabling you to turn the three color channels on or off 
by software control. For example, the red and blue 
channel can be turned off when the 80 character 
channel is turned on, resulting in a green phosphor 
video presentation. 

For convenient operation, the DVM board may occupy 
any slot in the Apple II. The DVM also features low-power 
consumption and low-power schottky logic.

Word Processing: 

Lessons Loud and Clear 



Avuncular Ed Scouten, an English teacher for nearly half a 
century, finds the story instructive : student and teacher are 
going over a paper on the eminently practical topic of dressing 
for the job interview. Both look down at the mistake-ridden 
composition. The student, seeing for the first time errors that 
escaped him time and again, says, "Wait, wait, wait, mis- 
take." 

This scene will reoccur time and again as the two plow, line 
by line, through the manuscript. And all the while the man in 
the checkered jacket will be wondering, "What is it that makes 
this student so sharp, so adept at finding mistakes that mo- 
ments before, in the sign-language sanctuary of his dormi- 
tory, he couldn't have seen with the Mount Palomar tele- 
scope?" 

Ed Scouten proffers a well-educated guess. His suddenly 
astute charge at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf 
at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New 
York, has demonstrated once again that the hearing impaired 
are a curious mix of understanding and misunderstanding. 

Quiet Mistakes. "They make errors that are typically 
deaf," says Scouten, a native of Omaha, Nebraska, who began 
his career counseling two deaf brothers at a Boy Scout camp 
during the Great Depression. 

"They have been taught the use of the articles — a, and, and 
the — countless times," explains Scouten. "And they have been 
taught tense. But, actually, they have been overtaught. It's like 
hammering a nail. You get down to the surface and yet you 
keep on banging. And this overteaching irritates them. They 
hate English with a passion. English teachers are picky-picky. 
They're always finding fault, and the students come to expect 
red marks on their papers." 

The foregoing state of affairs did not sit well with Scouten 
and fellow NTID educators Nancy Smith and Don Beil, who 
equate literacy (English and computer) with survival in the 
competitive eighties. So last year, with the blessings and as- 
sistance of the folks who produce the Magic Window word- 
processing program, they designed a course that would bring 
the two literacies together. 

By the time hearing children are five years old, Scouten ex- 
plains, they've learned all the syntax they'll need for everyday 



conversation. By contrast, a hearing-impaired child — particu- 
larly one who has been deaf since birth or since before the ac- 
quisition of speech— tends to render English in a fractured syn- 
tax devoid of the idioms of spoken English. A child who's never 
heard conversation will have problems developing the nomin- 
ative "I." He's likely to talk "baby talk," as in "Charlie wants 
candy," or "Nice pretty she." And he will have trouble grasp- 
ing what might seem the simplest parts of speech, the articles. 

"Think of the multiplicity of exposures a hearing child has 
to a, and, and the," marvels Scouten. "The deaf child doesn't 
have them. They are abstractions. Show me an a. It's a num- 
ber concept." 

Without sound, the deaf must rely on visual or tactile com- 
munications. They write, finger-spell, or, more commonly, 
they sign, using American Sign Language, a language of more 
than one thousand ideographic symbols suggestive of Chinese 
characters. A child who learns one or more of these language 
skills early enough can communicate effectively — but signing 
is not standard English, Scouten emphasizes. "Theoretically, 
with signed English we give the complete syntax but, as a rule, 
in our rush, in the spirit of the thought, we leave out words," he 
says, finger-spelling as he speaks. "There," he says, making 
his point. "I said 'we' but I didn't sign it." 

Top of Tiny Heap. It's estimated that less than one percent 
of the United States population can be categorized as deaf. The 
one thousand hearing-impaired students enrolled at NTID rep- 
resent the cream of that minority. They've graduated from a 
four- year residential school for the deaf or a public high school 
that offers special programs for the hearing impaired. Yet, 
gifted as these students may be, they usually enter NTID read- 
ing at the sixth-grade to eighth-grade level. 

As if this weren't enough, there are the mindsets of techni- 
cally oriented students and teachers. Students choose NTID 
hoping to achieve vocational goals, and they prefer to concen- 
trate on their majors. By the same token, their teachers have 
enough problems imparting technical concepts without worry- 
ing much about English. 

"The technical faculty tends to use a limited vocabulary, 
and there are arguments to be made as to whether that's in 
students' best interests," observes Don Beil, an associate pro-

SOU Al l<

fessor and member of the data processing department. "Yes, 
you are communicating, but you're not doing anything to en- 
hance students' English skills." 

Perhaps the trick to teaching English, then, lies in linking it 
to a technical major such as word processing. Motivation is the 
key ; students could be shown that improved English skills en- 
hance the marketability of their technical training. 

"In the past," says program architect Bell, "an English 
teacher would make red marks on a paper and give it back to 
the student, who then discarded it. Word processing now al- 
lows an English teacher to make red marks and to require the 
student to make the changes on the computer. There's some 
motivation to get it right the first time." 

Computing Bricks. Teaching the deaf is pretty much a mat- 
ter of reducing the abstract to its concrete form, according to 
Scouten. A visually responsive word processor hooked to a 
large television monitor might be just the ticket for teaching 
English to a classful of deaf technical students. It might make 
the complex so simple that it could, as Scouten puts it, be 
"grasped with the eyeballs." 

That, at any rate, was the original theory. But how to test 
it? There was no question who would teach it; Scouten was the 
logical candidate. There was no question who would take it — of- 
fice career majors from Bell's data processing department. 
They were already being trained on a dedicated IBM word 
processor and needed exposure to word processing systems for 
microcomputers . 

And, of course, there was no question about the make of the 
microcomputer. It'd be an Apple, a machine with which the stu- 
dents were already familiar. Rochester, home to Kodak and 
birthplace of Xerox, is, after all, part of Johnny Appleseed 
country. There are between thirty and forty Apples at NTID 
alone, not counting the twenty that faculty members have at 
home. 

No, there was only one outstanding question for Bell and 
company: Which word processing program to use? 

There's a wealth of word processing programs now avail- 
able for the Apple. Capabilities vary, so do prices, but there 
are always unique aspects to each user's choice. In NTID's 
case, the major factors favoring Magic Window were its 



eighty-column capability and easy line-by-line editorial fimc- 
tions. The NTID staff looked at early versions of Apple Writer 
and Word Handler, but found these programs wanting; the for- 
mer came only in forty-column, and the latter . -as hard to read 
without hi-res text enhancement. 

"Visual display wajs a biggie," Nancy Smith explains. "Some 
of the other programs, like Word Handler, give you full dis- 
play so you can see what the page looks like, but without high- 
resolution video display, you can't see it very well. And a lot of 
our students have some kind of visual handicap as well as 
hearing impairment." Magic Window's answer to this need is 
its horizontal scrolling feature. By hitting a tab fuhction key, 
the user can enjoy the benefits of large, forty-column type in an 
eighty-column format. If nothing else, adds Smith, that 
reduces eye strain and fatigue. 

Soft Shoulders. Horizontal scrolling has a drawback, 
though: You can't see the full line or paragraph you're work- 
ing on at any one time on the monitor. That's an inconveni- 
ence. Smith concedes, but it's one for which the other features 
easily compensate. "You get used to the tabs," she explains. 
"One jump and you're over to the end. You can scroll across 
the page and see exactly what the line will look like and exactly 
where things will end in the right-hand column." 

Two other factors played a part in the selection of Magic 
Window. Smith and company were looking for a progfram that 
was easy for students with poor language skills to use, yet suf- 
ficiently different from the IBM system they were already 
trained on. Magic Window's menu-driven package filled that 
bill. Smith says, because the options are limited, clear, and 
reasonable. The program's line-by-line editorial features also 
make "the cut and paste" of composing less onerous. 

"You can go back and edit each line individually, and some 
systems don't give you that capability," she explains. "It's 
very easy to tell where you are and identify exactly where your 
cursor is and where the change is going to be made." 

When it comes to choosing a word processing program, ser- 
vice is often as important as product. Bell says Artsci has been 
extremely supportive of NTID's project. Its staff made them- 
selves available to answer questions and provided extra copies 
of the program at no extra cost; most important, they allowed 
NTID to tailor the documentation to their student's needs. 

"Our students don't read very well, and you know what 
most user manuals are like," says Nancy Smith, launching in- 
to a general complaint. "There was nothing exceptionally bad 
about Magic Window documentation, but manuals are diffi- 
cult for the average reader and more so for someone with lan- 
guage difficulties and without the background in technical ter- 
minology. I think that in the competitive software industry the 
companies that survive will be the ones who document their 
product well and make it easy for the user." 

No Moving Lips. The Apple, its R2D2 beeps aside, speaks 
the language of the deaf, the moving cursor printing silently on 
the screen. The job world, even one dominated increasingly by 
computer technology, speaks volumes in sound. Lips move 
when people speak, but even a skilled lip-reader discerns only 
60 percent of the spoken words. The remainder are elusive 
sounds like "ga" and "ng" that defy detection and make sen- 
tence reconstruction so much educated guesswork. "Sweeney 
and Sweetie are homophonous," Scouten points out. "They 
look alike on the lips." 

Speech handicaps and the limitations of lip reading isolate 
the deaf worker. Scouten has witnessed the scene often — a 
hearing impaired employee working in a little cubicle in a big 
office and having no friends — excluded. "They don't have to do 
anything over because the barrier Is already there." 

Not surprisingly, the deaf often choose the easier path. 
They seek each other's company in larger cities and gravitate 
toward vocations strong on psychomotor skills that don't re- 
quire extensive co-worker communication — printing, wood- 
working, and baking. But while the deaf can retire to their 
signing comer of the world, they cannot escape the rest. They 
are dependent to some degree, on the vast hearing majority.

JULY 1982 



"Perhaps we should have a weaning period away from our 
very comfortable, pleasant, ultramodern, deaf microcosm," 
says Scouten, reflecting on the question of signing at NTID. 
"It's a cozy place. In terms of the technical world, it's ex- 
tremely real; in terms of the workaday world, it's unreal." 

A short while later, Scouten picks up the idea during a rem- 
iniscence that includes an old Victor Borge routine on pimctua- 
tion, replete with matching sound effects. "In the California 
School for the Deaf at one time, the manual (finger-spelling) 
teachers would use period, comma, exclamation point" — 
Scouten utters the appropriate squiggly, squishy sounds as his 
hand flashes hand punctuation signs — "but that's all gone by 
the boards now. Nobody does that anymore. That's too much 
trouble. Today we lay back and sign. It's fun to sign, I love to 
sign. It doesn't tax the brain. I can split infinitives, have dan- 
gling doodads, and just rattle on, and whether I'm grammati- 
cal or not makes no difference." 

Blessed for Success. But by Scouten's and Bell's lights, the 
ability to communicate precisely will matter in the technical 
world that's dawning. The race will go to those literate in com- 
puters and English. But how do you prepare the hearing im- 
paired for their entry into the cruel, hard world, a world in 
which they're already underemployed? "You set your course 
up as a business, like a game," Scouten says. "I'm to be a 
hearing boss, a person who has invested a lot of money in Ap- 
ple computers, and we have exactly ten weeks in which to get 
this company operating. I, as a hearing boss, am not interest- 
ed in sign language. I don't care beans about the deaf, I'm not 
interested in anything but one thing, making lots of money." 

In one sense, this make-believe world bears an ironic re- 
semblance to the real thing — all of the fifteen office-practice 
majors enrolled in the course are women. A curious footnote, 
Smith notes, in light of NTID's predominantly male student 
body and the greater incidence of congenital deafness among 
males (the ratio is 3 to 1) . "Sex stereotyping of jobs happens in 
the deaf as well as the hearing world," Smith says. "It's just an 



extension of who's the typist, who's the secretary. Well, you've 
automated the office and guess who's in it?" 

In Scouten's classroom, who's in it is our teacher-tycoon 
and his merry band of business majors. Because this is a simu- 
lated hearing environment, communication is strictly by Up 
reading, reading, finger-spelling and, where possible, by 
speech. Signing is nix. If a student doesn't understand some- 
thing, Scouten and the student will tough it out in speech; fail- 
ing that — it was necessary only once during the past quar- 
ter — they'll resort to signing. "'The deaf read lips more exten- 
sively than the average person realizes, and they can talk — 
from very intelligibly to poorly. But one can acquire an ear 
even for poor speech." 

On class days, a student volunteer heads for an Apple key- 
board, either typing an instructional passage chosen by 
Scouten or trotting out one of her own. The latter invariably 
produces the greater merriment, as students, eyes glued to the 
large, centrally located monitor, spot those telltale syntax and 
grammar errors, like, "Me it killed," or, "It killed me," for the 
correct, "It's killing me." The short compositions written by 
the students on topics like appropriate office behavior and job 
skill requirements may seem elementary. Smith says, but they 
aren't to the deaf. "These thoughts have to be reiterated with 
students. Language deprivation makes it really important that 
all those social graces everyone takes for granted come 
through loud and clear." 

Now See This. Abstractions pose a major obstacle. Con- 
sider the relatively simple concepts of short-run and long-nin 
for a money-making enterprise such as Scouten's theoretical 
company. 'To get these ideas across, Scouten usually uses 
"chalk talk." He'll draw a short line on a blackboard with dol- 
lar signs going out to represent plant and equipment invest- 
ments. Then he'll show the class a long line with dollar signs — 
profit — coming in. 

"The fun aspect is when a thread of understanding comes 
through," he explains. "It's quite different from a graduate

program where one introduces a theory, teaches the history of 
the theory, the philosophy of the theory, and various interpre- 
tations of the theory. You start off with the abstract and get 
more so. In educating the deaf, it's just the opposite. You have 
an abstraction and you bring it down closer to earth." 

There's a tendency to think of the hearing impaired as stone 
deaf. "We treat them all as though they couldn't say boo," 
Scouten complains. To set the record straight: Very few NTID 
students are without any residual hearing; hearing impair- 
ment varies widely, and so does command of speech. Most 
deaf students use hearing aids, to hear conversation better, to 
hear life-saving alarms, and to monitor their own speech. 

No, there's nothing homogenous about the deaf. TTie same, 
it might be added, can be said about helping them. Two major 
trends dominate current professional thinking on the subject, 
according to Scouten. On the one hand are those who prefer 
to regard the deaf like an ethnic minority, linked actually or 
potentially by signing. On the other is "mainstreaming," the 
deaf world's moral equivalent of busing. "The idea here is to 
take deaf children out of special schools and put them into spe- 
cial classes in public high schools and integrate them, if possi- 
ble, with hearing children," Scouten says. 

Reality Strikes Again. Scouten is philosophically predis- 
posed to this approach, but he readily concedes that there's a 
hitch: local school districts must be willing to provide support 
services for the deaf student, ranging from note takers to tu- 
tors. That's a dim prospect in these less-than-balmy times, 
particularly for an educational approach that is playing to 
mixed reviews. 

Smith reports that a number of Rochester-area students 
who tried mainstreaming are now back in the local school for 
the deaf because of inadequate funding and inadequate student 
preparation. "They go out and try it and find that it doesn't 
work too well, and they come back and have to start over." 

Not that there haven't been successes, she adds. The em- 



JULY 1982 



pirical evidence is inconclusive. "Some of our best students 
have been mainstreamed, but you can't say mainstreaming 
made them that way. I think the deaf definitely need training 
in socializing and incorporating with the hearing world, but I 
don't think mainstreaming is inherently helpful. On some kids, 
it's an added strain." 

As a federally funded institution, NTID steers a politically 
neutral course through these philosophical waters. It harbors 
oralists like Scouten, who favor voice communication and Up 
reading; it entertains total communicators who advocate the 
simultaneous use of American Sign Language with voice and 
lip reading; and it shelters devotees of signing only. "Ed feels 
strongly about oral supplemented with manual," Smith ob- 
serves diplomatically. "You'll find people here whose feelings 
are equally strong about simultaneous communication and 
signing. N'TID accepts a range of students with a wide spec- 
trum of backgrounds in communication skills. Some are pure- 
ly oral and do not sign; others are pure signing. We have a 
range of people on the faculty and among the students, and I 
think that's positive." 

One Man, One Rote. Avuncular Ed Scouten, teacher of the 
deaf, listens politely to the official line but he knows what he 
knows. Eclecticism in instruction is not his way of teaching. "If 
we conducted a business In this manner. It would go to the 
wall," he says. 

Smith smiles. So does Bell. They know when Scouten is on 
the stump, and they can already hear the conclusion coming 
'round the bend. "In order to teach English, everybody has to 
contribute, not just English teachers. All the technical people, 
the staff — everybody is violating every rule in the book. Why, 
no wonder we can't teach them. It's impossible." 

That bit of hyperbole hardly seems to square with nearly a 
half century of teaching the deaf, but it suggests a feistlness 
reminiscent of his students. 

Says Scouten, "It's hard for me to do as I'm told." m

Exec Sirius 

from page 38 

Bradley. "If you do an extra good job, you get a bonus. The in- 
centive for playing the game is a big score." 

In an adventure game the incentive is to solve the puzzle 
and complete the game successfully. Bradley is a big fan of 
adventure games, which may explain why Sirius has recently 
entered the genre with Kabul Spy. 

At the End of a Long Day, It's Apple Time. Sirius added a 
nice touch to the marketing of Mark Turmell's Beer Bun by 
using the Olympia beer logo in the packaging and in the game 
itself. They tried the same thing with Fly Wars, trying to get 
the cooperation of a household pesticide company, but there 
were no takers. 

Bradley wears many hats at different times, figuratively 
speaking. Sitting at a table discussing contracts, for example, 
Bradley puts himself in the place of the person he is talking to. 
"Keeping things in a reasonable context, everybody has to win 
when striking up deals like this. 

"It all depends on the manufacturer's cooperation. The 
Olympia deal was mostly done on the phone and with a letter of 
understanding. It was done neatly and has been beneficial for 
both parties." 

Sirius has no intentions at present to go into areas like edu- 
cation and business. The reasons are obvious to Bradley and 
Jewell. 

"In education there is a good demand but no sales." Brad- 
ley says. "Schools want software but don't want to pay for it. 
They want to buy one copy and make five hundred of their 
own. Where's the payback to the manufacturer?" 



In business, the nature of the products is a major reason 
why Sirius is not interested. "The amount of support needed for 
VisiCalc must be frightening," says Jewell. Sirius has enough 
trouble keeping up with callers trying to find their way through 
Kabul Spy. 

Bradley believes that the personal computer in the home is 
a family affair and that games should appeal to everyone. He 
abhors sex-oriented advertising, which usually offers more 
than the product delivers. 

"Sex has no place in this industry. Who needs it? The art- 
work for Minotaur with the female figure is about as much sex 
as you'll ever find in a Sirius product." 

It's Bradley's conviction that most of society has morals, 
but that software buyers should still be careful. Parents have 
to screen television movies, and the same is true of software 
programs. Bradley admits to being picky sometimes, but he 
feels strongly about producing a family product. 

Where Fun in the Fourth Dimension Is the Secret Weapon. 
Sirius has gone through some changes in its two years, but they 
still deliver winners. 

At Applefest in Boston, Sirius had an impressive five-foot- 
tall video screen hooked up to an arcade machine showing 
Bandits. There was always a line of kids waiting to play the 
game. Out there on the floor, larger than life. Bandits stood up 
to the test. Another potential bam burner is Larry Miller's 
latest tour de force, Minotaur. 

"There's not a product that we've released that I'm 
ashamed of. I don't lose a wink of sleep on that account," 
boasts Bradley. "If a product is obviously not right, Jerry and I 
say, 'Let's fix it or forget it.' " 

Two years is nothing in the life of a star, but things move 
faster in the world of software publishing. Sirius is keeping 
pace and growing at a healthy rate. 

The future is always uncertain, but the end is nowhere in 
sight. Hi

Exploring Business Basic, 
Part 10 

First things first. I must offer an'apol- 
ogy for being absent from these pages 
last month. Here's hoping that this 
month's material will keep you busy 
enough to make up for the gap in our cy- 
cle of exploration. 

On the subject of exploration, con- 
gratulations are due to John Jeppson for 
his excellent articles on Basic and the Ap- 
ple III. The article in the April issue 
which covered a character set editor was 
a fine one. If you haven't seen it, try to 
get a copy; it was really that excellent. 

On With It. This month's article could 
be entitled "Down and Dirty in the SOS 
Mines," or perhaps more accurately, 
"The Console Driver Is Your Friend." 
Last time, as you will perhaps recall, we 
looked at techniques that substituted a lit- 
tle thinking (about how to access records 
by key values) for the brute force meth- 
od (having the computer scan hundreds 
of records looking for the one we 
wanted). The result was a method that 
was both fast and flexible. In general, 
there's no substitute for taking a little 
time to think about the best way to im- 
plement a program before beginning to 
write it. 

Along with attempting to choose the 
best method to implement a particular 
task, a good programmer always looks at 
the tools at hand. Since every computer 
and every implementation of Basic is dif- 
ferent, it pays to check out the computer 
on which the program will run and see 
what features and capabilities it can lend 
to the task. Sure, some folks will insist 
that it is most important to write pro- 
grams that run on as many computers as 
possible, but the truth is that some modi- 
fication is always required, so why not 
make the best of the environment you 
have (especially if that environment can 
save you some work)? 

Basic with Hot SOS. The inspiration 
for this month's article came from a 
friend who complained how hard it is to 
write in assembly language on the Apple 
ni and then use that code in a Basic pro- 



gram. After letting him know about the 
technical note on writing invokable 
modules, the question of what he wanted 
to do arose. As expected, he wanted to do 
special handling of input for some menu 
screens. He also wanted to handle the 
listing to the screen of records longer 
than eighty columns, and was perplexed 
as to how to do this without having to re- 
write the screen each time. After seeing 
how well VisiCalc did its vertical and 
horizontal scrolling, he was even more 
convinced that assembly language was 
the only way to go. 

Before this article is concluded, we'll 
see how to do these things and more us- 
ing Basic and the power of SOS. In a pre- 
vious column, we did some work with the 
Basic invokable module. Request. Inv, 
found on the Business Basic product disk. 
We covered the functions filread and fil- 
write, which correspond to the SOS 

/ read and / write calls. This 

month we'll concentrate on the control 
and status functions of the request.inv 
module, which correspond to the SOS 
d control and d status calls. Re- 
member that SOS views files as one of 
two fundamental types, character and 
block. The control and status functions 
we'll use this time are generally appli- 
cable to character files, and are docu- 
mented in the respective manuals for the 
devices. 

Since it's already been announced 
that this month's column will deal with 
the console driver (that wonderful 
driver you communicate with via key- 
board and screen) , your next logical step 
is to get out your Standard Device 
Drivers Manual and prepare to follow 
along with the fascinating discussions 
that lie ahead. The discussion of the con- 
sole driver starts on page 27 of the 
manual, and our first task is to become 
familiar with the capabilities of the 
console driver. 

Some Further Consolation. The 
console on the Apple III really consists of 
two devices: the keyboard (normally a 
read-only device) and the screen (nor- 
mally a write-only device). To commu- 
nicate with these devices, and especially 




I m a n 



to change their operating characteris- 
tics, SOS allows you to give and receive 
information from the driver, a software 
routine that is responsible for managing 
the physical screen and keyboard hard- 
ware. Information about the driver is ob- 
tained by using the status commands, 
and changes are made through the con- 
trol commands. Let's start with status. 

The following program uses the Re- 
quest.inv invokable module to allow calls 
to determine the status of the console: 

10 DIM statuslen(18) 

15 DATA 8,41,2,1,1,1,6,-1,5,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1, 
2,1,-1 

20 INVOKE"/basic/request.inv" 

25 FOR i = 0 TO 18:READ statu5len(i):NEXT 

30 device$ = ". console" 

These first lines do some initialization. 
Since the status call will always return 
the buffer string fully padded to 255 char- 
acters in length, the statuslen array is set 
to the number of valid bytes returned by 
each different call. Note that some calls, 
indicated by a -1 in the data list, are re- 
served and therefore invalid. Those of 
you who are comparing the data state- 
ment with the descriptions of the status 
calls in the Device Drivers Manual will 
notice some anomalies in the list but, 
have faith, all will be explained later. 
Note too that the invoke statement needs 
to be changed to refer to the proper path- 
name for Request.inv on your system. 
Meanwhile, on with the code: 

35 INPUT"Stotus code: ",stat$ 

36 IF stat$ = " " THEN 100 

37 stat=CONV(stat$) 

38 If stat<0 OR stat>18 THEN PRINT"Status 
code out of range, try again":GOTO 35 

39 IF statuslen(stat)<0 THEN PRINT"lnvalld 
status code, try agaln":GOTO 35 

40 buffer$ = "" 

42 PERFORM status(%stat,@buffer$)devlce$ 

Lines 35 through 42 first check the status 
request for validity, and then use the per- 
form statement to make the SOS call. Re- 
member, that status returns its result in 
the string variable buffer$ and the @ 
symbol instructs Basic to pass the ad- 
dress (location) of the buffer$ variable, 
so that status can return the requested in- 
formation in the string. Now that buffer$

can print it out in meaningful form with 
the following: 

45 endlist = statuslen(sfat) 

47 line$ = ""

55 hexvalue$ = HEX$(ASC(MID$(buffer$, 

U))) 

57 char = TEN(hexvalue$):IF char<32

NEXT i

Note that endlist is the number of valid 
bytes of status information, so the rou- 
tine from line 50 to 70 scans buffer$ and 
prints out the hex value of each charac- 
ter. The line$ string accumulates the 
ASCII character values (after changing 
real control characters to printable con- 
trol characters in line 57) so they can be 
printed out below the hex values. Line 65 
handles the case where more characters 
need to be printed than can fit on a single 
Une and line 72 cleans up after the last 
line of hex values is printed. 

All that remains is to return to re-

quest the next status code, and to pro- 
vide a place to go to terminate the pro- 
gram. 

■ .80 GOTO 35 

100 INVOKE 

110 END 

Let's look at some sample output for a 
few typical status calls. 

First, something simple. According to 
the manual, status 0 should do nothing. 
The request module does a little better 
than that, returning the name of the de- 
vice being accessed; to wit: 

2E 63 6F 6E 73 6F 6C 65 

More interesting and twice as myste- 
rious is status 1, which returns the total 
state of the console driver. For reasons of 
compatibility with printers, only the 
printable ASCII characters are listed be- 
low. All others can be deduced by their 
hex equivalents above. As you fool 
around with other status calls, the order 
in which these status indications fall will 
become apparent. In the meantime, 
figure 1 shows you everything you 
wanted to know about the console and 
then some ! Note that the special charac- 
ter symbols will actually print out on 
your screen. 

Now for something simpler and more 
useful. Status code 2 is advertised as in- 
dicating the status of the line termina- 
tion character. Of course, you know the 
line termination character as the return 
key, or perhaps you have noticed that re- 
turn and control-M are the same charac- 
ter. Notice the two bytes returned from a 
status 2 call: 

80 OD 

The first byte indicates (as described in 
the Device Drivers Manual) that a spe- 
cific line termination character is en- 
abled. The second byte (OD) is hex nota- 
tion for decimal 13, or the control-M (re- 
turn) character. Later on we'll see that 
this can be changed to any other charac- 
ter for fun and profit. 

Now come two calls that are interest- 
ing but fraught with danger if you fool 
with them. Specifically they are status 6 
and 8, the attention and any key events. 
Events can be set in SOS that trigger in- 
terrupts to an interpreter (like Basic) to 
inform it that some specific action is re- 
quired or requested. Again, as described 
in the drivers manual, status 6 gives the 
priority and event ID of the attention 
event, along with the address of the event 
handler that services the event, and the 
character code that triggers the event. 
The return from status 6 should look 
something like this: 

01 01 OE 67 F3 03 



Again, only the printable ASCII charac- 
ters are listed. The rest of the characters 
will show up on your screen when you run 
the program. Notice that the first two 
bytes are the priority and the event ID 
and that the next three bytes compose the 
address of the event handler for this 
event. 

For those of you who wonder how Ap- 
ple III addresses all that memory, part of 
the answer is here. Three-byte address- 
es are used throughout most of the sys- 
tem code to allow addressing up to a theo- 
retical limit of 512K bytes. The impor- 
tant thing to remember is that you should 
not change the event handler addresses, 
since that's an easy way to cause the sys- 
tem to leap off into space, never to re- 
turn. The real key value in this call is the 
last byte, the attention character itself. 
As you can see, it is hex 03, which is also 
ASCII character 3, usually known as con- 
trol-C. Yes, all those times you pressed 
control-C to stop a program or break a 
listing, you were setting an event within 
the console driver, which flagged SOS to 
call Basic's event handler to shut down 
the current activity. 

Later on we'll discuss how to change 
the attention character to something be- 
sides control-C; it's guaranteed to baffle 
your friends. For now, consider the any 
key event, number 8 on your hit parade : 

00 01 OB 67 F3 
9 s 

Same format, except with a different 
priority and different event handler ad- 
dress. In addition, there is no event char- 
acter, since this event is set by pressing 
any key. As you might expect, this is 
the mechanism Basic uses to implement 
the on KBD statement. 

Other status calls of interest include 
the ones for cancel status (yes, Virginia, 
you can avoid control-X printing the 
backslash character and skipping to the 
next line) and backspace status, which 
determines if the back arrow is destruc- 
tive (erases the character backed over) 
or nondestructive (allows you to use the 
forward arrow copy feature) . All this and 
more is yours to investigate with the 
status call. 

Still Curious? You now have a pro- 
gram that will do all the status calls list- 
ed in the Standard Device Drivers Man- 
ual. Ah, yes, you say: "What about status 
call 18, preserve viewport?" Truth is, 
there's a little problem with the way this 
invokable is wril^en. Status call 18 (for 
those who are not following along in the 
manual) saves the entire contents of the 
viewport into the buffer. Unfortunately, 
individual Basic strings are limited to 255 
characters, and any attempt to use a 
string array in this invokable will illicit a 
polite error message. Worse yet, an at- 
tempt to save a viewport of more than 255 
characters using the status call will lock 
up Basic as the invokable module happi- 
ly writes data into the middle of Basic it- 
self. For that reason, the statuslen array 
doesn't allow the use of that call. Those of

you who are more adventurous, or who 
use viewports of less than 256 charac- 
ters, should consider the following: 

41 IF sfat=18 THEN GOSUB 125 
43 IF stat=18 THEN GOSUB 140 
125 Wemp= VPOS:ht9mp= HPOS 
130 PRINT CHR$(26),CHR$(0);CHR$(0); 

CHR$(2);CHR${26);CHR$(9);CHR$(24); 

CHR$(3),CHR$(12); 
135 RETURN 

140 TEXT:VPOS=vt8mp:HPOS = htemp 
145 RETURN 

200 DATA 8,41,2,1,1,1,6,-1,5,-1,1,1,1, 
1,1,1,2,1,243 

These changes to the program will make 
a special case of the save vieivport call. 
Basically it works like this: Line 128 
saves the current cursor position, and 
line 130 sets up a window consisting of the 
first three lines of the screen. Similar ac- 
tion could be taken using the Basic win- 
dow command, but it doesn't hurt to see 
how console commands are used to ac- 
complish the same purpose. In any case, 
setting up the window (which contains 
240 characters) gives the status function 
something to read within the 255 charac- 
ter limit of the buffer$ variable. Line 140 
restores the cursor to its original posi- 
tion, and since we changed line 200 to in- 
dicate 243 characters expected (240 -I- 3 
bytes of coded information), the pro- 
gram will list out the screen data just as 
it does the other tj^es of status data. 

To give you an idea of how this works. 
Imagine that the three lines in figure 2 
are at the top of the display when you rxm

Apple III, is no exception. Because of the 
way the video is organized for accesses 
over its internal sixteen-bit bus (which 
also provides transparent access to ex- 
tended address bjrtes), the characters 
are mapped in an alternating pattern, 
with visually adjacent bytes split by a 
distance on half the viewport window. 

All that leads to the following adjust- 
ment of our program, to reconstruct the 
image from the scramble in the buffer: 

75 IF sfat=18 THEN GOSUB 160:GOSUB 140 

160 INPUT"Press RETURN to reconstruct the 

captured display: ";a$ 
165 bufl$=MID$(buffer$,4,240) 
170 HOME:PRINT CHR$(21)"5"; 
172 FOR i=1 TO 3:VPOS=j:HPOS=l:FOR i=l TO 

40:PRINTMID$(bufl$,80*(i-l)+i,l); 

MID$(bufl$,80*(i-l)-l-i+40,l);:NEXT 

i:NEXT i 
175 TEXT:RETURN 

You can adjust the constants in line 72 to 
accommodate other viewport sizes. Note 
also that in line 170 the statement print 
CHR$(21);"5"; Is used to turn off sev- 
eral console options (like scrolling and 
new line) to ensure that the data Is writ- 
ten back correctly. The text statement in 
line 175 sets everything back to normal. 

Getting Ckintrol. Now that you have all 
this information, the Immediate reaction 
is "how do I change things?" The follow- 
ing is a sample program that allows the 
use of the control call to modify the state 
of the console driver to your wishes. Re- 
member, modifying certain things (like 
event handler addresses) can cause the 
system to crash, so try to keep It simple. 
With that warning, here's the magic in- 
cantation :

By contrast, control 2 is nice and safe 
and also serves to introduce the input test 
routine at line 5000, as follows:

One of the things you might enjoy do- 
ing with the termination character rou- 
tine involves remembering that the open 
apple key adds 128 to the value of a given 
key value. Therefore, to change the func- 
tion of the return key to require open ap- 
ple (return) is simply a matter of setting 
the termination character to ASCII 141 
(128+13). Amaze your friends! Note too 
that Basic does not reset these values un- 
til you reboot, so if you set the value to 
something you can't type (or happen to 
forget), you're out of luck!

Two-byte reads are a whole world by 



themselves. This is the way to set up your 
application to use the numeric keypad for 
special functions, to read the state of the 
Apple keys, and so on. More information 
is in the Device Drivers Manual. (If in- 
terest in these techniques Is sufficient, 
maybe it would make a good subject for a 
future column.)

Type-ahead buffer size is interesting only 
in the ability to set it to zero (no type- 
ahead).

This just flushes the type-ahead buffer 
(Like control-6, which is handy if you want 
to guarantee a certain input state or tim- 
ing.

use this routine, you must first call atten-

tion exactly. Only then can you feel free 
to change the attention character.

What applied to the attention event ear-

No-wait input is fun to play with be- 
cause it bypasses buffering and waiting 
for return, and gives the inputting pro- 
gram whatever has accumulated since 
the last input request. The program is re- 
sponsible for making sense of the en- 
tered characters. This might come in 
handy in conjunction with the console- 
synchronizing function (chr$(22)) to wait 
a certain time and see what had been 
typed in that period.

2150 bufferS = CHRS(128)

This is a handy function for typing in 
passwords and other characters where 
selective display is desired. In addition, it 
allows programmatic setting of the con- 
trol-8 (display control characters) key- 
board function.

Retype allows the forward-arrow key to 
copy characters into the buffer. This is 
the normal mode for Basic, but can be 
disallowed to provide pure cursor move- 
ment.

2340 GOSUB 5000 

2345 IF yes THEN buffer$=CHR$(192): 

RETURN 
2350 buffer$ = CHR$(128) 
2355 RETURN 

This is really handy for applications pro- 
grams taking input from the keyboard 
using standard input statements. It, in 
connection with disabling the retype 
function, allows the naive user to be sure 
that what shows up on the screen is what 
is actually going to be input when return 
is pressed. 

2400 INPUT"Do you want the Cancel function to be 

enabled? ";a$

2440 GOSUB 5000 

2445 IF yes THEN buffer$ = CHR$(192): 

RETURN 
2450 buffer$ = CHR$(128) 
2455 RETURN 



Turning on destructive cancel is the most 
powerful feature of this routine. By now 
you have probably become accustomed 
to getting a backslash and then a car- 
riage return and line feed when you press 



control-X. When destructive cancel Is 
turned on, the console driver instead is- 
sues a destructive (erasing) backspace 
for every character in the input buffer. 
The net effect of this is that the cursor 
snaps back to the exact place it was when 
you began to type that line, erasing ev- 
erything as it goes. This is not particu- 
larly handy when you are writing pro- 
grams if you want to cancel a line and 
then use the forward arrow to correct the 
mistake. However, it makes lots of sense 
in an application where you might be con- 
fused by the backslash and the cursor sit- 
ting on the line below, expectantly wait- 
ing for who knows what. 

2500 INPUT"Do you want Escape Mode enabled? 

";a$ 

2505 IF a$="" THEN errorcode= 1:RETURN 
2510 GOSUB 5000 

2515 IF yes THEN buffer$=CHR$(128): 
RETURN 

2520 buffer$=CHR$(0):RETURN 

Escape mode is another handy thing 
when you are developing programs, but 
you might want to turn it off during an 
application program, especially if you 
want to restrict the input to Just the 
prompted locations. If you use destruc- 
tive backspace and destructive cancel, it 
makes sense to disable escape mode also. 

2600 errorcode=l:RETURN 

Downloading an entire character set 
cannot be implemented with this invok- 
able because of the 255-character limit on 
the buffer. Don't despair, however, since 
there is the great download.inv to take 
care of the problem. See your friendly 
download.doc file on the Basic product 
disk for more details. 

2700 PRINT"Not currently implemented" 
2705 REM sub$(buffer$,1,l) contains the character 
count 

2710 REM the rest is individual character definitions 

(max 8) 
2715 errorcode= 1:RETURN 

Even though it is not possible to down- 
load an entire character set using this in- 
vokable, control request 17 does provide 
a mechanism for downloading eight 
characters at a time. Although the proc- 
ess for developing the character defini- 
tions is beyond the scope of this article, 
there is enough information in the De- 
vice Drivers Manual to get you started. 

2800 errprcode=l:RETURN 

The process of restoring a viewport is 
also left to the reader. Because of the 266- 
character buffer limit, it is not possible to 
restore a whole viewport. Further, the 
initial three-b5^e code at the front of the 
buffer is undocumented, which makes it 
a little tough to create your own view- 
port definitions. Don't be discouraged, 
though. There's lots to do that can make 
your application development smoother 
and more friendly (and lots of time re-

Homework I This has been quite a 
treatise on the use of the Apple III con- 
sole. There are lots of other useful op- 
tions in the console driver that we'll 
cover next time; meanwhile, here's a 
present, a homework assignment that 
should give you some chuckles while 
proving that there is very little you can't 
do with SOS and Basic. Without further 
ado, try the following: 

5 INPUT"File to fill with assorted trash: ";file$ 
10 IF file$=" " THEN 230 
15 OPEN#l,file$

"reluctant", "willing"

200 PRINT#1;" that neither of them talked to their 

";f$(INT(RND(l)*5 + l)); " about." 
210 NEXT i 
220 CLOSE 
230 END 

Running this little jewel should create the 
following kind of file (be sure to run at 
least fifty lines) : 

1 Once a dowager duchess was im- 
pressed by a reluctant but enthusiastic 
young flagpole climber that neither of 
them talked to their mother about. 

2 Once a duke was completely 
overwhelmed by a pathetic but whole- 
some young tadpole that neither of them 
talked to their analyst about. 

3 Once a duke was bored by a willing 
but wild young queen that neither of them 
talked to their grandparents about. 

4 Once a prince was repulsed by a pa- 
thetic but shy young tadpole that neither 
of them talked to their analyst about. 

Unfortunately, if you print this file out 
on the screen (by replying . console to the 
file name prompt, for example), you get 
the sentences wrapped around because 
the lines are more than eighty charac- 
ters long. How nice it would be if you 
could see them printed out and scroll 
horizontally to read them, just as the con- 
sole already scrolls down to allow more 



information to be printed. Next month 
we'll explore the following program in 
detail, and other programming tricks 
with the console, but for now, type and

Be sure you type it in exactly as written, 
and be sure that bnk$ in line 75 contains 
exactly twenty-four spaces between the 
quotation marks. Then use the first pro- 
gram to create a file of junky messages. 
If you want, you can change the data 
statements to make up your own mes- 
sages. Then use that same file name for 
the second program and use the arrow 
keys to scroll up, down, left, and right 
through the file. If you have trouble, just 
wait until next month when some of the 
murky water will clear. 

Until then, there doesn't seem to be 
anything else that can console you, so 
have fun with your Apple III! H

Tools Of The Craft, Part 13 

An Exercise Completed: CopyText. 

As a faithful follower of the Path, you 
should have had no trouble completing 
last month's exercise. You were asked to 
create a program, CopyText, which 
copies all the text from the file of your 
choice into a file called CLONE. TEXT. 
As you read these words, you are prob- 
ably flush with triumph at having dis- 
posed of the exercise so handily, and are 
waiting to compare your solution to 
mine. Who am I to disappoint you? Com- 
pare away! 



PROGRAM 
CopyText; 

(* Copy the text in physicol file COPYTEXT.TEXT 
to physical file CLONE .TEXT*) 
CONST 

SourceName= 'COPYTEXT.TEXT',- 
DestNGme= 'CLONE.TEXT'; 
VAR 
Source, 
Destination 

Jext {* same as FILE OF Char *); 

Ch 

:Char; 
BEGIN {* CopyText *) 

Reset{Source, SourceName); 
ReWrite(Destination, DestName); 



WHILE (NOT EOF(Source)) DO 

BEGIN (* Get and copy next line *) 
WHILE (NOT EOLn(Source)) DO 

BEGIN (* Get and copy next char *) 
Read(Source, Ch); 
Write(Destination, Ch); 
END (* WHILE NOT EOLN *); 
(* Finish reading current line *) 

ReadLn(Source); 
(* Reflect end of line in Destination *) 
WriteLn(Destination); 
END (* WHILE NOT EOF *); 
(* The following Close is not really necessary, since 
we were only reading from Source. It's good 
practice to do it, though. *) 
Close(Source); 
(* The following Close is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, 
if we expect to have the physical destination file 
around for examination, after program execution 
finishes. *) 

Close(Destination, LOCK); 
END (* CopyText *). 

Perhaps you had a sense of deja vu on 
reading this version of CopyText. If so, 
that's not surprising. This program is 
only slightly different from last month's 
Listerl. All we did was change the com- 
mentary a bit, change the names of the 
physical files on which the program op- 
erated, and introduce a new text file, 
Destination, as the place where the list- 
ing display is sent (instead of the stan- 
dard output). 

Old programs never die, they're sim- 
ply reincarnated as new programs and 
routines whenever needed. So it was with 
Listerl; so it will be with CopyText. A 
program that always copies the text of 
the same specific file into another may 
strike you as being of limited utility. 
However, a generalized routine that 
copies the contents of any text file into 
any other text file will prove handy, in- 
deed. In a future installment, we'll resur- 
rect CopyText as just such a routine, so 
hang onto it. 

Input and Output with Non-Text Files. 
In previous discussions, we learned that 
Read, ReadLn, Write, and WriteLn will 
work only for a FILE OF Char; this be- 
ing true, you must use some other means 
of accessing files of other types. The file 
variable has been described as a "win- 
dow" into the physical file. At any in- 
stant, your program can '.'look through" 
the window at exactly one item in the file

(or at a meaningless garbage value 
which lies immediately after the last 
valid datum in the sequence). The file 
variable assumes the value of the cur- 
rent datum. You can refer to this value in 
a Pascal program by appending the 
caret (a) to the file variable identifier. 

Some terminals display a caret, 
others an "up-arrow" for this character 
code. Don't confuse it with the up-arrow 
cursor-movement key found on many 
video terminal keyboards. If a keyboard 
contains only an up-arrow key, that key 
will probably generate a caret. If both the 
caret symbol and the up-arrow are found 
on different keys of the same keyboard, 
however, you'll want to press the caret 
key, not the up-arrow key, when refer- 
ring to file variables in your Pascal 
programs. 

To illustrate the use of the caret with 
file variable identifiers, if IFile has been 
declared as a FILE OF Integer, then 
IFile A is an Integer variable that con- 
tains the value of the datum that is cur- 
rently in IFile 's window. 

How To Get It. In general, when any 
file is opened with Reset in a Pascal pro- 
gram, the file window is automatically 
positioned over the first item in the file. If 
we assume that the physical file INTE- 
GERS. DATA contains the three values, 
1,2, and 3, in that order, then IFile a = 1 
immediately after the execution of Re- 
setdFile, 'INTEGERS.DATA'). To ad- 
vance through the data, your program 
must issue successive calls to the built-in 
procedure Get. 

As shown in figure 1, Get accepts ex- 
actly one argument, an identifier that 
corresponds to a file variable. If the file 
window is not already looking past the 
end of file. Get advances the window 
by one datum position, and loads the 
file variable with the value that is stored 
in the new position. As mentioned ear- 
her, upon opening INTEGERS.DATA as 
IFile, the initial value of IFile a is 1. If 
Get (IFile) is executed, then the window 
advances by one position, and IFlle a as- 
sumes the value of 2. Another Get (IFile) 
call advances the window yet again, re- 
sulting in an IFIIca value of 3. One more 
Get would advance the window past 
the last datum in the file, causing 
EOF (IFile) to become True, and the 
value IFilcA to become undefined gar- 
bage. In general, your programs should 
never try to Get more data from a file F 
once EOF(F) is True.

APPLE IS A TRADEMARK OF APPLE COMPUTER 
VISICALC IS A TRADEMARK OF PERSONAL SOFTWARE INC. 



For any physical data file (except 
an Interactive one), Pascal keeps track 
of the location of the last datum 
that was written into it. When, during 
Reading or Getting, the file window is ad- 
vanced beyond this last datum, Pascal 
returns an EOF value of True for that 
file. (Note that the method used to deter- 
mine EOF for Text or Interactive files is 
rather complicated, owing to a compli- 
cated internal structure that the Pascal 
system imposes upon them. The inner 
secrets of Text and Interactive files will 
be revealed further down the Path.) 

You must have been disappointed to 
learn that Read won't work with file 
types other than Text and Interactive. 
However, we can compensate for this 
loss by using Get in conjunction with an 
appropriate file variable to simulate a 
Read for any particular file type. To be 
specific, if FileVar is a FILE OF Data- 
Type, and Datum is a variable of Data- 
Type, then the following compound state- 
ment behaves exactly as we would ex- 
pect Read(FileVar, Datum) to behave: 

BEGIN Datum := FileVar a; Get(FileVar) END 

At first glance, you may wonder why 
the assignment to Datum comes first, 
and the Get second. It's natural to think 
that the Get should come first. After all, 
you have to "get" something before you 
can do anything with it, right? Of course ! 
But don't forget the invisible, "initial 
Get" that occurs when FileVar is opened. 
After a call to Reset, FileVar a contains 
the value of the first datum in the physi- 
cal file. No Get is necessary to acquire 
this value ; more precisely, Pascal has al- 
ready performed the first Get for you, as 
part of Reset. In order to keep the file's 
first value around, your program must 
assign it to another variable, such as 
Datum, before issuing any more Gets. 
This is why the assignment comes first in 
our Read simulation; to guarantee that 
the first value in the file will not be 
skipped. The subsequent Get advances 
the window to the next value in the physi- 
cal file. This value will wait patiently in 
the window until the Read simulation is 
executed again. 

You, Too, Can Put Out. Putting data 
through the window and into the file is the 
inverse of getting data from it. Opening a 
file with Rewrite moves the window over 
the first datum position in the file. Of 
course, Pascal assumes that position to 
be empty. The only way your program 
can fill the hole with some datum is to use 
the built-in procedure Put. Like Get, Put 
requires a file variable identifier as an 
argument. 

For a file variable F, Put(F) takes the 
value that is currently in the window Fa 
and writes it into the physical file that 
has been associated with F. Then, auto- 
matically, the file window advances by 
one position. Notice that the window dur- 
ing writing behaves much like the cursor 
on your video screen ; it always sits at the 



JULY 1982 



point where the next item will be writ- 
ten. Thus, it is always looking into "vir- 
gin" territory, and never onto an actual 
datum. Just as we simulated Read for an 
arbitrary file, using Get, we can use Put 
to simulate Write. The compound state- 
ment 

BEGIN FileVar A := Datum,- Put(FileVor) END 

is equivalent to Write (FileVar, Datum), 
where FileVar is a FILE OF DataType, 
and Datum is a variable of DataType. 

Putting It Together. Here are two pro- 
grams — the first creates a FILE OF In- 
teger, while the second displays its con- 
tents.

Interactive Files. The console device 
represents two sequences of characters, 
one incoming (from the keyboard) and 
one outgoing (to the video screen) . This 
seems to agree with our definition of a 
Text file and, of course, we already know 
that Pascal treats the console as a file — 
actually, your Pascal program sees the 
console as two separate files. 

Given all this, you may be tempted to 
think that the console corresponds to two 
Text files. It does, in many Pascal sys- 
tems. Unfortunately, there is a conflict 
between Pascal's notion of a file and the 
realities of interactive input. Stated sim- 
ply, it's not always convenient to do the 
"initial Get" when opening a file that has 
been associated with an interactive de- 
vice. With the console keyboard, for ex- 
ample, the file variable cannot be loaded 
until someone presses a key! The Reset 
operation cannot conclude, and so pro- 
gram execution must remain suspend- 
ed, until the user presses the first key. 
Here's a small program that illustrates 
the problem: 

PROGRAM 
TextKbd; 

(* Demonstrates the "hang-up" that occurs when 
Reset — and "initial Get" — is applied to interactive 
input device. *) 
VAR 
InFile 
:Text; 

Ch 

:Char; 
BEGIN (* TextKbd *) 

Reset(lnFile, 'CONSOLE:'); 
Write('Press a key: '); 

(* Simulate Read(Ch) — I could have used Read here, 
since Infile is of type Text, but this is just to show 
that Get works for all files. *) 
Ch := InFileA; 
Get(lnFile); 
WriteLnCYou typed ', Ch); 
END (* TextKbd *). 

When you run this program, notice 
that the prompt to press a key cannot be 
displayed on the screen until a key is 
pressed! Let's walk through TextKbd, so

we can understand clearly the exact se- 
quence of events that occurs when the 
program is executed. The first state- 
ment in the program is Reset(InFlle, 
'CONSOLE:'). Two consequences follow 
from the call to Reset. Because 'CON- 
SOLE:' is the system's physical file 
name for the console device, InFile is 
linked with the keyboard. (If the file var- 
iable had been opened with Re Write, but 
had still been associated with 'CON- 
SOLE:', it would have been linked to the 
video screen instead.) 

Next, the system tries to get InFile's 
first character. This sets off a chain of 
procedure calls internal to the operating 
system and P-machine simulator, cul- 
minating in a call to the "keyboard 
driver" (discussed during our May 1982 
stroll down the Path) . The driver proce- 
dure must wait for the user to press a key 
before it can send a character back up 
through the chain of procedures to the 
TextKbd program. Program execution is 
thus suspended until the user presses a 
key. 

When a key finally is pressed, the 
driver sends the corresponding charac- 
ter back to TextKbd, where it is loaded 
into InFile ^. The;i, and only then, can ex- 
ecution continue to the next statement, 
which, ironically, issues a prompt that in- 
structs the user to press a key! Next, the 
value in the file window, InFile^, is as- 
signed to the variable Ch. Another call to 



CJet is made, which means that the pro- 
gram must wait for the user to strike an- 
other key. Finally, the value of Ch is dis- 
played on the screen. Notice that this 
value is that of the first character typed 
by the user, not the second. 

Although InFile is a Text file, we're 
not using Read (InFile, Ch) here, but 
rather the compound statement simula- 
tion of that call (its "Get expansion"). 
This shows more clearly why TextKbd 
displays not the value that was typed in 
the midst of simulated Read, but rather 
the one that was typed in order to satisfy 
the "initial Get." If you want to prove 
that the simulated Read performs like 
the real thing, just substitute an actual 
call to Read at the indicated point, then 
recompile and execute. 

Reset performs an "initial Get" be- 
cause the designer of Pascal, Niklaus 
Wirth, did not take interactive input into 
account when specifying Reset's be- 
havior. Instead, Reset and Read are de- 
signed to access files that are stored on 
such media as floppy and hard disks, 
magnetic tapes, punched cards, and 
punched paper tapes. When adapting 
Pascal to microcomputers, the design- 
ers of the Apple Pascal system provided 
for interactive communication between 
human being and computer and neatly 
sidestepped the "initial Get" problem by 
defining the Interactive file type. An In- 
teractive file is identical to a Text file in

the sense that both represent sequences 
of Char values. When an Interactive file 
is Reset, however, no automatic "initial 
Get" occurs. Also, the sequence of op- 
erations in Read is reversed for Interac- 
tive files: the Get occurs first, followed 
by the assignment of the file window 
value to a variable: 

BEGIN (*lnteracfivo Read(F, Ch) *) 

Gef(F); Ch : = F A 

END; 

Note that the differences between 
Text and Interactive files apply to input 
only; output to either type works cor- 
rectly for both disk files and interactive 
output devices. 

Because Reset and Read give special 
treatment to Interactive files, a pro- 
gram or procedure that processes inter- 
active input differs significantly in struc- 
ture from one that acquires input from 
regular data files or Text files. To see the 
differences clearly, consider the follow- 
ing version of Copy Text, which has been 
rewritten to accept its input interactive- 
ly from the console keyboard. Compare it 
with the earlier Text file version. 



PROGRAM 
CopyTexf2; 

(* Copy the text in physical file CONSOLE: to physical 
file CLONE. TEXT. Input file is assumed to be 
Interactive, not Text *) 

CONST 

SourceName = 'CONSOLE:'; 
DestName= "CLONE.TEXT'; 

VAR 
Source 

:lnteractive; 
Destination 

iText {* could also be Interactive *); 

Ch 

:Char; 
BEGIN (* CopyText2 *) 

Reset(Source, SourceNonne); 
ReWrite(Destination, DestName); 
REPEAT (* Get and copy next line *) 
REPEAT (* Get and copy next char "■) 
Read(Source, Ch); 
IF (NOT EOLn(Source)) 
THEN 

Write(Destination, Ch); 
UNTIL EOLn(Source); 
(* Turn off EOLn *) 

ReadLn(Source); 
{* Reflect end of line in Destination *) 
WriteLn(Destination); 
UNTIL EOF{Source); 

Close(Source); 

Close(Destination, LOCK); (* Keep it around *) 
END (* CopyText2 *). 

As you can see, the two programs dif- 
fer primarily in the type of loops each 
uses to copy one file to another. Copy- 
Text employs two WHILE-DO loops, one 
nested within another, while CopyText2 
uses nested REPEAT-UNTIL loops. The 
purpose of either set of loops is to detect 
EOLn and EOF in an accurate, timely 
fashion, in order to permit the program 
to recognize and deal with line bounda-

If you're currently %r 
using Apple Pascal* on your 
Apple II, you're probably aware 
of some noticeable limitations. 
And you'd probably give a lot for 
an upgrade package, including 
the UCSD p-Systemf UCSD Pascal* 
and TURTLEGRAPHICS, that would get 
your Apple* to do what it's capable of. 

Upgrade to the UCSD p- System 
Version IV from SofTech Microsystems. 
It's got all the features of Apple Pascal, 
and then some. For instance, Apple Pascal's 
UNITS must be linked in at each compilation, 
the p- System's do not. And instead of being lim- 
ited to 32 UNITS, like Apple Pascal, the p- System 
allows a virtually unlimited number. 

How about peripheral support? The p- System 
supports all the peripherals that 
Apple Pascal does, plus a clock, 
and a lower case adapter. And, 
we get more out of the periph 
erals you've already got— 
shiftware modification on the 
keyboard, alpha lock key 
typeahead and characters 
not even on the Apple 
keyboard. 

And when it 
comes to graphics, our 
TURTLEGRAPHICS 
has everything in Apple's 
graphics, plus automatic 
scaling and four graphic modes, 
including both HIRES and LORES 

Then there's portability The 
p- System lets you develop gen- 
uinely portable, high-level applications for nearly 
any microcomputer around. It allows you to work in 
any combination of UCSD Pascal and BASIC 



(available as an add-on). 
And it provides support for 
dynamic memory man- 
agement and multitask- 
ing, with a full arsenal 
or enhancements. And if 
that isn't enough, your 
existing Apple Pascal 
I' programs are upward 
compatible with the 
p-System, and simply 
have to be recompiled 
to execute. All your Apple 
II needs is 64K of RAM 
and two disk drives. 

Last but not least, there's 
the price. Normally you'd have 
to pay as much as $825 for such 
a package. 

But, for the next two months, 
we're making this special upgrade 
offer to Apple Pascal users for a 
mere $295. That's a savings of 
over 60%. 

So just send in the coupon 
below, with your proof of pur- 
chase and check, money order 
or Visa or MasterCard num- 
ber, and you'll be on your way 
to getting more out of your 
Apple II than you ever dreamed

Your two months have already 
started.

lets you preview software 



I don't want to buy software I can't take a close 
look at, and I know you don't either. 

That's the reason I've organized the FIRST 
LOOK COLLECTION for Apple* owners who 
have a disc drive. As a member you can make a 15% 
down payment on most software, and I'll let you 
evaluate it for three weeks. If you decide not to 
buy, just return the program; and your down 
payment will be my only service charge. 

I'll only send you programs you ask for. You 
never have to buy anything. But if you do decide to 
buy, I'll sell to members at low membership prices. 

I don't intend to send preview discs out over and 
over again until the oxide falls off. After a program 
has been previewed a few times, I'm going to sell it. 

My goal is to sell good software you've had a 
chance to take a close look at and you're satisfied 
with. I am stocking best-selling games, utilities, and 
high quality educational software designed for home 
use. 

When you join, list three programs under $50 
each you're most interested in, and I'll let you pre- 
view two of them as part of your membership fee. 
The charter fee is only $45, so it's hard to lose. This 
membership fee will not only include a 15% down 
payment on your first two selections, but it will get 
you my illustrated FIRST LOOK COLLECTION 
catalog. 




If you've seen our ads before, you'U notice our 
name has changed. A fellow thought our name was 
too much like his company's, so we changed ours.

ries in the Source, and to prevent it from 
trying to acquire more data than the 
Source file contains. 

The WHILE-DO loops In the first pro- 
gram are appropriate because, in the 
case of regular files, Pascal is always 
looking ahead to the datum that lies Just 
beyond the one currently in use, and thus 
"knows" about such conditions as end of 
file and end of line well before the pro- 
gram uses EOF or EOLn to check them. 
Therefore, it is not only proper, but nec- 
essary for a program that works with 
regular files to check for EOF and EOLn 
before trying to do anything with the file 
window (such as assign its value to a 
variable). 

With Interactive files, Pascal can't 
determine whether or not EOF or EOLn 
is true until your program explicitly Gets 
or Reads a character. This is why the 
REPEAT-UNTIL loop is appropriate: 
it's designed to handle those situations 
where the program can only decide 
whether to quit looping after it performs 
some definite action (such as Getting or 
Reading a character, for instance). Of 
course, not all of the REPEAT-UNTIL 
loop body should be executed for all In- 
put characters. For example, the char- 
acter obtained by a Get or Read will be 
blank if it corresponds to EOF or EOLn, 
and should not itself be copied to the des- 
tination. Thus, there must be a guard 
within the REPEAT-UNTIL loop body 
which splits it into two or more concep- 
tual pieces. In CopyText2, the "IF (NOT 
EOLn (Source) ) " statement within the in- 
ner REPEAT-UNTIL loop takes care of 
this situation. It divides the loop into two 
parts : one to be executed for all charac- 
ters (the Read) , and the other to be exe- 
cuted only for "regular" characters (the 
Write) . It handles both EOF and EOLn 
situations, even though only EOLn is test- 
ed, because, in Pascal, EOF implies 
EOLn (as proven by our experiments 
with the Echo ASCII program a few 
months ago). 

In general, then, you'll find it most 
convenient to use the "WHILE-DO" type 
of program structure when accessing 
regular files (including all non-text data 
files) , and the "REPEAT-UNTIL" struc- 
ture (with internal guards) when treat- 
ing files interactively. Note that no rule 
requires you to associate a text file on 
disk with a file variable of type Text. In 
fact, you can link a disk file to an Inter- 
active file variable, if you wish, and ac- 
cess it using "REPEAT-UNTIL" meth- 
ods just as if it were an interactive I/O 
device. In other words, you never really 
have to use Text variables at all in Apple 
Pascal. Interactive variables will serve 
to access all textual material, whether it 
comes from disks or other I/O devices. 
This fact allows us to write general rou- 
tines and programs that can switch back 
and forth from disk to console input at a 
moment's notice; the very same code 
will apply in both situations. Be warned, 
however, that programs which use In- 



teractive file variables do not conform to 
"standard Pascal," which does not in- 
clude the Interactive file type. 

Predeclared Interactive Files. Apple 
Pascal predeclares three Interactive 
files: Input, Output, and Keyboard. For 
every program it processes, the Pascal 
compiler "inserts" the following decla- 
rations in the main (global) declaration 
area: 



VAR 
Input, 
Keyboard, 
Output 

interactive; 

It also injects the following "invisible" 
procedure calls at the beginning of every 
main program block (but not at the be- 
ginning of a procedure or function) : 

Reset(lnput, "CONSOLE:'); 
Reset(Keyboarcl, 'SYSTERM:'); 
ReWrite(Output, 'CONSOLE:'); 

The difference between the files In- 
put and Keyboard is a subtle but impor- 
tant one. Whether your program accepts 
data from either Input or Keyboard, the 
data comes from the same source: the 
console keyboard. If acquired through In- 
put (which is associated with the physi- 
cal file/device 'CONSOLE:'), the data is 
also echoed to the screen automatically 
by the operating system as we discussed 



in the May 1982 Pascal Path. However, if 
your program acquires its data through 
Keyboard (which is associated with the 
file/device 'SYSTERM: ') , the user's key- 
strokes are not echoed to the screen; if 
any echoing occurs, it must be instigated 
by the program. To demonstrate, here's 
a short program that echoes any capital 
letters just as they are, but echoes a 
blank for all other characters: 

PROGRAM 
Blanker; 

(* Accept nonechoing input from keyboard; echo all 
upper-case letters, but echo blank for all other 
characters. Terminate when at-sign key is pressed. ♦) 

CONST 

Blank= ' '; 
AtSign= "^i'; 

VAR 
Ch 

:Char; 
BEGIN (* Blanker *) 
REPEAT 

Read(Keyboard, Ch); 
IF ((Ch >= 'A') AND (Ch <= 7')) 
THEN 

Write(Ch) 
ELSE 

IF EOLn(Keyboard) 
THEN 

WriteLn (* Just to keep things pretty ♦) 
ELSE 

Write(Blank); 
UNTIL (Ch = AtSign); 
END (* Blanker *).

Be sure when using the Keyboard file 
to use the proper form of EOF and EOLn 
in checking for end of file and end of line. 
Even though Input and Keyboard are 
both tied to the console keyboard, EOF — 
that is, EOF (Input) — is not the same as 
EOF (Keyboard), nor is EOLn the same 
as EOLn (Keyboard) . Specifically, if your 
program is accepting input from the Key- 
board, EOF and EOLn will never be 
True, but, depending on the characters 
that the user types, EOF (Keyboard) and 
EOLn (Keyboard) will. As a matter of 
style (and self-defense!), you should al- 
most never use the EOF or EOLn func- 
tions without naming a file variable as a 
parameter. If a program gets its input 
from the Input file, it should always 
check EOF(Input) and EOLn(Input). If 
it uses the Keyboard file, then it should 
check EOF (Keyboard) and EOLn (Key- 
board) . Following this practice will help 
you avoid confusion and will eliminate 
one possible reason for program misbe- 
havior. 

Output to the Printer. There is noth- 
ing sacred about the physical files 'CON- 
SOLE:' and 'SYSTERM:', just because 
they are normally linked to the prede- 
clared files Input, Output, and Key- 
board. You are free to link them to your 
own file variables if you want to (even as 
they are simultaneously linked to the pre- 
declared Interactive files), and we will 
have occasion to do so more than once as 
we travel down the Pascal Path. An- 
other such physical file is 'PRINTER:', 
which corresponds to the output device 
(if any) that is hooked into slot 1 of your 
Apple's expansion backplane. To send out- 
put data to that device, simply use Re- 
Write to link a Text or Interactive file 
variable to the physical file 'PRINT- 
ER:', as in the short demonstration pro- 
gram below: 



PROGRAM 
PrnOut; 
CONST 

Message= "On the screen, and printer, tool'; 

VAR 

PrnDevice 

:lnteroctlve; (* Text Is also OK *) 
(* *** WARNING *** DON'T TRY THIS PROGRAM, 
UNLESS YOU HAVE A PRINTER HOOKED INTO 
SLOT 1 OF YOUR APPLE. THE PRINTER SHOULD BE 
TURNED ON, AND READY TO ACCEPT DATA FROM 
THE COMPUTER BEFORE YOU EXECUTE THIS 
PROGRAM. *) 
BEGIN (* PrnOut *) 

ReWrite(PrnDevice, "PRINTER:'); 
WriteLn(Message); (* To screen *) 
WriteLn(PrnDevice, Message); 

Close(PrnDevice); (* Not really necessary, but good 
form *) 
END (* PrnOut ♦). 



Before executing PmOut, take care 
that your system actually has a printer 
hooked into slot 1, and that the printer is 
ready to accept data. If there is no card 
in slot 1, Pascal will complain of I/O er- 



ror #9 ('No device') when you try to exe- 
cute PmOut. Also, the Pascal system 
may "freeze" in trying to send data to a 
printer that is either turned off or is "off- 
line." (Many printers have a switch that, 
when pressed, causes them to ignore 
data from the computer — this is known 
as the "off-line" switch.) 

Note that you may reassociate the 
standard files Input, Output, or Key- 
board to interactive devices (but not to 
text files on disk, unless you want the sys- 
tem to overload and reboot) , by using Re- 
set or Rewrite, whichever is appro- 
priate. Of course, you can't reopen any of 
these files until you Close them first. Re- 
member that Pascal opens these special 
files for you, automatically, at the start of 
every program, and you can't Reset or 
Rewrite a file that is already open. Re- 
assigning the predeclared Interactive 
files is a risky business, though, because 
they were never designed for that. It's 
preferable, instead to declare separate 
and distinct file variables, then link these 
new variables to the physical devices or 
files of your choice, as we did in PmOut. 

Something to Keep You Busy. By ac- 
cepting user input through the Keyboard 
file, your programs are free to echo any 
appropriate data to the screen, not just 
the exact characters that are typed. 
Write a program that responds to the fol- 
lowing single-character commands by 
echoing not the "command character" 
but the complete command name: 



CHAR 

A or a 
S or s 
M or nn 
D or d 
Q or q 
<blank> 
<other letters> 
<all others> 



ECHO 
Add 

Subtract 
Multiply 
Divide 
Quit 

<blank> 

ILLEGAL COMMAND 
<no echo> 



For example, this is what you might see 
on the screen after pressing the D key: 

Command: Divide 

Command: <program is prompting for another 
command> 

Encapsulate, within a function named 
NewCommand, the part of the program 
that prompts for, accepts, and responds 
to a command. NewCommand should re- 
turn a result of the enumerated type 
ComType : 

ComType= (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Quit) 

Program execution should terminate 
only after the user issues the Q (quit) 
command. 

In completing this assignment, you'll 
be turning the A, S, M, D, and Q keys into 
"special function keys" for a calculator 
program that we will begin to develop 
and refine, soon. Good luck! Meet you 
back here in thirty days, and we'll com- 
pare notes.

Mind Your 




BV PETER OLIVIERI 




Happy July! Welcome back once again and thank you for 
your cards and letters. They are very helpful in focusing the 
column on topics that are of interest to you. 

Stop, Look, and Listen. Many of you have been reading 
along for several months now. In fact, at least based on my 
mail, many of you have been qioite successful in integrating the 
Apple into your business. It's a good idea from time to time to 
stop for a moment and make sure that all is going well. Here's 
a brief self-evaluation to apply to your existing system. 

1. What is your policy concerning backup? 

Do you make backup copies of your important data files? 
Do you make them frequently enough? Do you have backup 
versions of your main processing programs? Do you have two 
copies of each of your backup disks (one for on-site and one for 
off-site)? Is the "off-site" backup copy actually kept off -site? 
Have you made arrangements with someone — perhaps a deal- 
er or business acquaintance — for operating your system on 
their equipment in the event of a real problem? 

2. How secure is your system? 

Is the equipment secure from theft? Are the programs se- 
cure from tampering by employees? Are program checks built 
in to detect unreasonableness? 

3. Is the system controlled well? 

Does anyone do a periodic audit of the system? Do the con- 
trols that were built in at the start really work? Have they been 
verified? 

One of the strengths of microcomputers is also one of their 
drawbacks. That is, they are easy to use. A disgruntled em- 
ployee or one with bad luck at the track may have the capa- 
bility of "solving the problem" by creating one for you! It is es- 
sential that you not get complacent with your fantastic micro- 
computer system. 

4. Is the equipment being cared for? 

Do you have dust covers for your hardware when it is not in 
use? (Dust is the real enemy of microcomputers.) Do you 
regularly clean the heads of your disk drives? Do you keep 
track of roughly how many hours of use your disks are get- 
ting? (Remember, they only last for about forty hours.) 

Have you taken precautions against the hazards of static 
electricity around your computer? Have you considered the 
dangers of a surge of power from your electrical outlet into 
your machine? Have you planned for a power interruption dur- 
ing processing? (Even a momentary one can cause significant 
problems for you.) Is your machine heating up considerably 
due to the addition of a lot of peripheral equipment but no fan? 
Do you keep a log of all hardware problems (date, cause, ser- 
vice performed, and so on) ? Is the computer area kept clean? 
Are disks lying all about or are they carefully cared for and 
stored? 

5. Is the software being maintained? 

Do you keep in contact with vendors and get the latest revi- 
sions, improvements, or enhancements to the software pack- 
ages you own? Have you written to or talked with the vendor 
about any special problems you might have had with the 
system? 

6. Are the people being cared for? 

Have they been properly trained? Should they be trained on 
any new features of the system? Do they get appropriate 
praise for their important role in the organization? 

7. Do you regularly consider the future needs of your 
system? 



Have you tracked your computer needs over the next year? 
The next five years? Will you eventually need a hard disk? Will 
the software you own right now be compatible with your fu- 
ture needs? Will you need a better or faster printer? Are there 
other software applications packages you should be 
considering? 

You get the idea. Once a computer system is installed and 
working, your job is not over. Any computer system must be 
managed. It's easy to get comfortable with a system and as- 
sume that it will manage well by itself. All too often, we only 
realize the importance of each of these considerations after it 
is "too late." Read them again. If you see some places where 
yon are a bit lax, now's the time to remedy the situation. 

Charting a Course. If you are an avid sailor or powerboat 
owner, you know that the most important item on your boat is 
not an Apple but a cruising chart. A Chart Kit is produced by 
the Better Boating Association (Box 407, Needham, MA 02191) 
containing all the appropriate charts for a particular region in 
an ea.sy-to-handle spiral bound chart book. These charts are 
widely acclaimed as being extremely clear and accurate. 

One of the most important items at BBA (besides charts) is 
an Apple. BBA president Jim Owen has Apples at work and at 
home. (The at-home Apple is used as a backup for the one in 
the office as well as for work Owen brings home.) The system 
that is used in the office includes an Apple II Plus with 48K, a 
Sanyo monitor, two floppy disk drives, and an IDS printer. 
Since Owen got started with his Apple some two-and-a-half 
years ago, he can certainly be counted as one with a good deal 
of experience. 

One of the major advantages Owen sees to using a micro- 
computer in the office is the fact that it allows him to be on top 
of the business. Since he does all of the major work on the ma- 
chine (except for some data entry) himself, he is quite knowl- 
edgeable about what is taking place from day to day. He likes 
the Apple in particular because it is user friendly, convenient 
(you can run it when you want it) , and easy to learn to use. He 
is self-taught and has designed all of his management reports 
himself. 

Owen's favorite software packages will come as no sur- 
prise to you. He thinks VisiCalc is terrific and that DB Master 
is just perfect for his database needs. Apple Writer is suffi- 
cient to handle the office word processing tasks and BPI ac- 
commodates those accounting jobs that are necessary for 
BBA. In addition, Owen uses Trend Spotter, Appleplot, and 
VisiSchedule. 

One impressive aspect of Owen's use of the Apple is his de- 
sign and development of management reports. In addition to 
using the standard reports furnished by the software pack- 
ages, Owen has designed a cash-flow report that has helped 
him cut costs significantly over the last few years. He used 
VisiCalc as the basis for making these cash flow and profit pro- 
jections. He also used VisiCalc to massage some data pro- 
duced by the BPI package in developing yearly summary 
reports to be given to stockholders. The shareholders get to see 
monthly differences (actual numerical and percent differ- 
ences) for a variety of income and expense categories. 

The shareholder's report itself is done using Apple Writer. 
Owen always incorporates a lot of visual detail into his reports 
and has several bar charts for the shareholders to look at. 
These include yearly sales data, net sales, quarterly profits, 
regional sales, and so forth (all produced by his graphics pack- 



186 




ages) . Needless to say, the shareholders are impressed. 

Owen is now focusing on using the Apple for modeling 
various aspects of the business. He wants to be able to pose 
more "what if" type questions about when customers are like- 
ly to replace their charts as well as to perform a variety of 
other market analyses. 

In some organizations, the computer sits somewhere on a 
desk in a comer, or the user doesn't use the machine to its full 
potential within the setting. This is certainly not the case at the 
Better Boating Association. The Apple is an important man- 
agement tool that provides valuable planning and operational 
information to the organization's president. Jim Owen, a 
successful and competent manager, has found his Apple to be 
a very valuable resource. 

A Reintroduction. Apple Computer is surely committed to 
the successful reintroduction of the Apple III. Not only did 
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak state this explicitly at the Apple- 
fest computer show in Boston, but Apple Computer has recent- 
ly introduced an information newsletter for Apple III owners 
and users. The newsletter is called Dimensions and can be ob- 
tained by writing to: Apple III Newsletter, 10260 Bandley 
Drive, Mail Stop 3-E, Cupertino, CA 96014. It is mailed regu- 
larly (and free of charge) to all Apple III owners. Just send 
your name, address, and Apple III serial number to the ad- 
dress just mentioned (not to Softalk) and you'll be placed on 
the mailing list. 

The newsletter's intent is to provide Apple III users with a 
vehicle for exchanging experiences, to highlight software de- 
signed specifically for the III, and to answer questions from 
various readers about their particular system. The first issue 
contains a brief listing of some of the software packages avail- 
able for the III, instructions on upgrading your Apple to 256K, 
data about recent Apple III software revisions, technical notes, 
and a calendar of coming events. It is a good beginning. 

As an indication of the commitment of Apple Computer to 
this machine as the ideal small business system, the newslet- 
ter mentions that the reintroduction of the Apple III was the 
number one project for the entire company in 1982. Enough 
said! 

AppleCalc? Be on the lookout for a new software package 

from Apple, Senior Analyst. It's a VisiCalc-like product that 
can be used by the financial manager, or the sales manager. It 
is a very powerful generic financial tool. A particular user 
may need Senior Analyst, VisiCalc, or both! Senior Analyst 
works best when some or all of the following conditions exist : 

1. The same model will be used many times. 

2. Formatted reports are often required. 

3. Data from different models must be consolidated and 
shared. 

4. Assumptions in the development of the model need to be 
shown. 

Be on the lookout for the Senior Analyst and consider it as an 
addition to (or alternative to) your "modeling" library. 

Time Out! If you are at all like most of us, you are extra- 
ordinarily busy. You probably write notes to yourself quite fre- 
quently. We all have our own to-do lists. Some of us actually 
have lists that refer us to other lists. Well, a product is avail- 
able to Apple owners that can help you to organize your lists 
(and consequently, your time). It is called Time Manager and 
is distributed by Image Computer Products. 

Time Manager gives your Apple the power to help you or- 
ganize and plan your activities while at the same time main- 
taining accurate and complete records for your future refer- 
ence. To use this program, you will need an Apple II or Apple 
II Plus with 48K of memory, a disk drive, and a monitor. Addi- 
tional peripheral equipment certainly enhances the overall 
usefulness of the package but is not necessary. Some of the ad- 
ditional pieces that would help are a printer, a compatible 
clock card, a lower case adapter, and a second disk drive. 

The package comes with a readable user guide that ex- 
plains all of the features of the software. When you first start 
Time Manager, you are asked a few questions about the cur- 
rent date and data file you are using and then presented with a 



T A L 1^ JULY 1982 

calendar of the current month. It is clearly displayed in typi- 
cal format on your screen. A set of arrows points to "today," 
and any day that has some memos stored is shown on the 
screen in inverse. By pressing the arrow keys, you can move to 
a display of the next month or the previous month. You can, of 
course, pass through several years of calendars in this fashion. 

Let's say that you are looking at the month of July on your 
screen. The arrows (actually the > and < symbols) point at 
July 12. If you press the return key, the display shows all of the 
memos you entered for July 12. Now, if you press the arrow 
keys, the display will move you through the days of the month 
(either forward or backward) and even into other months. 
Rather nice! 

Back to our example. Let's say that you're looking at the 
display for July 12. You have the option of making an entry on- 
to this day's calendar. An entry always consists of four parts : a 
priority, a permanence, a category, and some text. The parts 
must be typed in that order. The priorities you can use are 1, 
2,3, and note in order of decreasing importance. Entries are al- 
ways displayed in priority order. This helps you organize your 
time better. The star(*) priority has a special characteristic in 
that star entries always appear on today's date. That is, if you 
haven't done them, they automatically get moved to the cur- 
rent day. This is a good way in which to set up your to-do lists. 
The "permanence entry" is used to indicate that a particular 
entry is to stay there from year to year (for example, a note 
about a birthday or wedding anniversary) . 

An entry's category is simply a letter from A to Z. Time 
Manager allows you to define (and store) a list of what each 
category letter stands for. You can then search for items in a 
specific category. The final entry is the text entry. This is the 
memo, note, or schedule item you wished to record in the first 
place. 

In addition, you can issue a command that calls to the dis- 
play a series of notepads (up to twelve of them) where you can 
place entries that are not really tied to a particular day. For 
example, you may create a notepad listing purchases you want 
to make over the next few weeks. Another notepad might con- 
tain a list of repairs that are needed around your home or of- 
fice. You can name the notepads and edit them quite easily. 
And, as with any screen in Time Manager, you can print a 
copy of your notepad. 

Time Manager even incorporates some totaling and ac- 
counting features as part of its package. It can provide some 
accounting and totals for categories such as income received, 
hours worked, and expenses. As many as nine separate ac- 
counts can be maintained. Totals for each account can be ob- 
tained for a day, a month, or any specified time period within 
the current year. Totals can also be obtained for the entire 
year. 

This is but the beginning of the Time Manager's useful- 
ness. On any screen, you can press the slash, / (much the way 
you can in VisiCalc), and have a list of command codes dis- 
played. Brief descriptions of some of these commands should 
give you a good indication of the power of this package. 



/A Allows you to alter such things as dates, cate- 
gory names, disk titles. 

/D Deletes an entry. 

/L Selects priorities for display 

/M Moves an entry from one date to another 

/N Retrieves the notepad directory 

/P Prints entries 

/X Copies data to a new disk 

/T Displays commands for working with accounts 



The commands listed are but a few of the commands 
available. Time Manager also offers a line editor, a notepad 
editor, commands for dealing with upper and lower case, and 
much more. One of the nicest aspects of the package is the 
ability to print out a copy of what is on the screen. For 
example, each Sunday evening you could print out a copy of 
this month's calendar, a two- week schedule, and all your 
notepads. Then during the week you could cross items off your 
printed lists and add any new ones that occur to you. On the 
following Sunday, after a few minutes of entering your new

CHEQUEMATE is the complete home financial package for the Apple. All aspects of home money 
management are addressed including checks, charge cards, cash control, automated tellertransactions, 
"checkless" bill paying, and budgeting. You can even split checks into two categories (I.e. to keep track 
of interest and principal separately for house payments). A complete set of reports allows you to make 
hard copy printouts or review them on the screen. In addition the contents of the screen can be printed at 
any time. Standard abbreviations may be defined so recurring entries can be generated with minimal 
keystrokes.

data, you can generate your next appointment book. 

The hardest part of using this package has very little to do 
with the package itself. In order to make effective use of Time 
Maying er, you have to use it. You have to manage your time 
well enough that you can regularly use the package and all its 
features. Once you see its advantages for yourself, it's quite 
likely you'll make a point of building a few minutes into your 
schediile each week for using Time Manager. 

PFS Users. If you use PFS (the Personal Filing System 
database), make sure you contact Software Publishing Corpo- 
ration and find out how you can get the latest update. It has 
some very nice features. Also, the PFS series now has a graph- 
ics package available. It is called PFS: Graph and displays 
PFS data as bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and much 
more. We'll be reviewing this new release in a future column. 

The Readers Speak. "Can you give me suggestions for look- 
ing at business software before I buy it? I really don't care to 
purchase something that I eventually will not use or is not ap- 
propriate for me. I have not been able to find a dealer that is ei- 
ther willing to spend time with me on software or who has 
enough of the packages that I am interested in. I am sure 
others must have this same problem. Any guidance you can 
give me would be greatly appreciated," B.D., Long Beach, 
California. 

You are quite right, B.D. It's a very difficult problem. It's 
difficult for many reasons. F'irst, there is an awful lot of busi- 
ness software out there. For example, there are well over fif- 
teen different word processing packages and close to twenty 
database management systems (and this includes only the 
major ones) . It's very difficult for dealers to stock all of these 
different packages and almost impossible for them to become 
skilled at using all of them. They do not have the money, the 
time, or the resources. Second, many dealers are more inter- 
ested in selling machines than in selling individual software 
packages. 

You have several alternatives. (1) Find a dealer in your 
area and see how much help that dealer can provide to you in 



your evaluation and selection of different software packages. 
(2) If you need to visit with more than one dealer, then, by all 
means, do just that. (3) Call the vendors of the software pack- 
ages you're considering and ask them if they will provide you 
with the names of some satisfied users in your area that you 
can call or visit. (4) Look for a local Apple User Group that 
meets regfularly and can provide you with the experiences of 
other users. (5) Look for a computer user group in your area. 
Many of these groups have "hands on" rooms that allow mem- 
bers to experiment with both hardware and software, 
(6) Read publications that review business software (Softalk, 
InfoWorld. and others). (7) There are now seminars being set 
up that teach how to use various software packages. Exam- 
ples include "Introduction to VlsICalc" and "Choosing a Word 
Processing Program." You might look for similar programs 
and seminars being held in your area. 

Your letter suggests an idea. Someone could establish a 
successful business by setting up a shop that allowed prospec- 
tive software buyers to experiment with the various packages. 
The packages would not necessarily be for sale on the prem- 
ises. Rather, a very large selection would be available, along 
with several Apples, so that people could experiment with 
packages before pxirchasing them. Personnel would be ad- 
visors/consultants to those availing themselves of the store's 
services. Of course, there would be an hourly charge associ- 
ated with using the facility but it's highly likely that software 
buyers would be willing to pay a nominal amount for this "one- 
stop shopping" and advice. It has some interesting 
possibilities. 

As you can see, there isn't a simple solution to your dilem- 
ma. I hope that some of these ideas will help. If you gel stuck, 
write me. I'll try to respond as soon as possible. Hi

'THAT'S IT!" 



There's nothing like the feeling you 
get when you've got the solution. 

And nothing else will help you 
solve problems better, smarter, faster 
than the Visi™ programs for your per- 
sonal computer. 

For example, our VisiCalc® pro- 
gram: It's *1 in the business because 
it takes the work out of working with 
business numbers. The VisiCalc 
program is the powerful "electronic 
worksheet" that speeds planning and 
budgeting. It lets you ask "what if?" 
and see the answers immediately. So 
you can analyze the impact of deci- 
sions before you make them. 

Our VisiTrend/Plot™ program 
combines graphics with forecasting 
and statistics. It automatically performs 
complex calculations and produces 
charts and graphs. So you can analyze 
the past, forecast the future and plot 
your results in an easy-to-understand 
visual form. 



In addition, our series includes 
theVisiFile™ VisiDex™ VisiSchedule^ 
VisiPlot"; VisiTerm™ and Desktop/ 
PLAN™ programs. 

But the Visi programs are far 
more than individual problem-solvers. 
They're all inter-related, just like your 
needs and tasks, to give you a fully 
integrated solution 

All of the Visi programs work in 
much the same way, and they auto 
matically interchange data, too. 
So it's easy to learn and use any 
of them, work in many different 
ways with all of them. 

They're brought to you 
by VisiCorp™ The one com- 
pany whose only business 
is helping you make tne 
most of the personal 
computer in your 
business. 

Ask your 
retail computer 



store salesperson for a demonstration 
of the Visi series. They'll help you and 
your computer do all the things you're 
intent on doing.

The software publishing business is getting more like the 
music business all the time. Publisher A will announce that 
he's shipped x copies of Melon Picker. Publisher B will then 
proclaim that he shipped 2x copies of Plumber's Helper. Fi-

Apple Galaxian when it first hit the Apple market. 

That's all the more remarkable when you consider ihai Ap-

tionally slow spring season and that Galaxian hit during rela- 
tively prosperous times while Knight of Diamonds was intro- 
duced in the midst of the slowest software market In the last 
eighteen months. Likewise, it's unheard of for programs other 
than arcade gam.es to break that rapidly.

Memory — you never seem to have quite 
enough of it. 

But if you're one of the thousands of Apple 
owners using the SoftCard, there's an economical 
new way to expand your memory dramatically. 

16K ON A PLUG-IN CARD. 

Microsoft's new RAMCard simply ^ ' 
plugs into yourApple 11,® and adds 16k M

read/write storage. 

Together with the SoftCard, ^ll,^* 
the RAMCard gives you a 56k ^^'^mpmmmm 
CP/M® system that's big enough »| 
to take on all kinds of chores that || - 
would never fit before (until now, y| « » ?| ^ 
the only way to get this much ^|^ "^^"^*" \ 

memory was to have an Apple ^ 
Language Card installed). L % ; K 

GREAT SOFTWARE: : ;l

With the RAMCard and 

SoftCard, you can tackle large- |r ■mr^ - J

computing with our COBOL and ««l I j- 

FORTRAN languages. Or greatly \ \ ^ 

increase the capability of CP/M t iCp— 5 



applications like the Peachtree Sonware account- 
ing systems. VisiCalc™ and other Apple software 
packages can take advantage of RAMCard too. 

And RAMCard gives you the extra capacity to 
develop advanced programs of your own, using the 
SoftCard and CP/M. Ei/en \N\th the RAMCard in

The month of May was absolutely abominable for software 
sales. The kindest word said by any dealer was, "We had sev- 
eral good months in a row, so I guess we shouldn't complain." 
A combination of factors led to poor software showing. Good 
spring weather in wintry climes had people outdoors rather 
than at their computers. The difficult economic climate was 
also a ma jor contributor. 

All program genres suffered. Business system sales

slowed, resulting in reduced sales of business software. Soft- 
ware to aid home programmers dropped completely out of 
sight. Users picked and chose among entertainment software 
with some definite trends indicating conservatism in their 
choices. 

First, Infocom's series of text adventures held their own. 
Apparently fueled by interest in Deadline and the increased ex- 
posure to the Zork series crea,ted by their introduction on the 
IBM Personal Computer, Infocom's product line suffered the 
least from the downturn. Likewise, adventure fans were will- 
ing to shell out the $100 necessary for Time Zone, on the theory 
that the value received made the program a bargain. 

Second, arcade buyers went for the tried and true — mean- 
ing eat-'em-up games. Snack Attack retained third position in 
the Top Thirty, Taxman rose to sixteenth, and Jawbreaker, 
thought out of contention, resurfaced in a tie for twenty-sixth. 



Third, entertainment software with tinges of artistic merit 
held up better. In this category were Bruce Artwick's Night 
Mission pinball game, Tony Suzuki's Star Blazer, and Paul 
Stephenson's Swashbuckler. Also falling here is Choplifter, the 
stunning programming breakthrough by Dan Grorlin that en- 
tered the lists at number eleven although some of the nation 
didn't receive it in May and much of the rest only got a limited 
supply. 

There were only position changes in the Apple III software 
list. The most noteworthy trend was the rise of Great Plains 
from tenth to eighth. Their hard-disk based accounting system 
is now being praised as one of the relatively few programs that 
sell systems. This is no trivial compliment when one considers 
that the system has to include a hard disk. 

Of course, VisiCalc III led sales of Apple III software, with 
Apple Writer III and PFS in second and third positions, re- 
spectively. 

The Business Ten list got a slightly new look with General 
Manager from On-Line Systems and VersaForm from Ap- 
plied Software Technology edging onto the bottom rungfs. 
There were only minor position changes among the top eight 
programs. 

The Word Processing Five got doubled to reflect both the in- 
creased number of competitive word processors in the market 
and the proofreading programs that are beginning to make 
sales inroads. Apple Writer II continues to impress end users, 
but the market is relatively quiet while awaiting Ihe delivery of 
Screenwriter II from On-Line Systems.

This one package includes software that lets you 
create smooth animation in your own programs, add

requires many pictures and objects to be easily and quickly 
accessible), and create and use a new t\pe of Apple shape table. 

The animation routines gi\ e vou the pou er to

then load them \\ ith i>ur routines into vour programs. These routines 
have the same animation teclinit|ues used in the best .Apple arcade games. 

The picture object editor allows vou to create hi-res 
pictures and objects in o\er 100 colors, and save huiulreds of 
them on a single disk to be tiuicklv recalled and reconstructed. 
Bv attaching a provided machine language subroutine to vour programs, 
pictures can be easilv recreated, and objects located anvwhere on anv picture. 
These same routines arc being used to create and displav the graphics tor

of the total market for proofreading programs and appears to 
have a solid grip on the market. 

One other item of note about the word processor market 
was the reappearance of PIE. Last year, Apple PIE domi- 
nated southern California word processing and was making in- 
roads across the nation when the closure of Programma and 
the decision to upgrade the product caused it to be yanked 
from the market. The revised product, brought out by Hayden 
under the name PIE Writer, is just coming into general distri- 
bution and is already making its mark. 

The Hobby Ten market was truly a depressed area during 
May. Bag of Tricks from Quality wrested the lead from Phoe- 
nix's Zoom Grafix. Apple owners again showed a definite pref- 
erence in product in this area during tight-money times. Utili- 
ties from Beagle Bros and graphics packages from Penguin

practically own this segment of the market. 

Home Accountant continued as the unchallenged leader of 
the Home Ten list, although its sales tailed off considerably 
from the previous month, when it had risen to second on the 
Top Thirty. Nevertheless, it has a comfortable lead over its 
competition in the home finance field. 

MasterType continues to widen its lead over Typing Tutor, 
and Data Capture 4.0 continues well in front of the other com- 
munications packages. A total newcomer to the Home Ten list 
was Crossword Magic, from L&S Computerware, another 
product that seemed to hold up better in the depressed market. 

All the specialty entertainment lists saw some shake-up. Of 
course. Knight of Diamonds went to the head of the Fantasy 

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 6.8 percent of 
all sales of Apples and Apple-related products volunteered to participate In 
the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early In June to ascertain their sales lead- 
ers for the month of May. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was number of sales made — 
such other criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer 
retailer, and personal preference of the individual respondents were not 
considered. 

Respondents in June represented every geographical area of the conti- 
nental United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in 
the index number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. 
The index number is an arbitrary measure of relative strength of the pro- 
grams listed. Index numbers are correlative only for the month in which they 
are printed: readers cannot assume that an index rating of 50 in one month 
represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus-or-minus 4.1 percent, which trans- 
lates roughly into the theoretical possibility of a change of 3.17 points, plus or 
minus, in any index number.

lantis held on to third with Ultima tailing off to fourth. Crush, 
Crumble and Chomp from Automated Simulations was fifth. 

Among adventure games, Deadline accomplished what 
most observers believed was the impossible : A text adventure 
outsold the leading graphics adventure. Kabul Spy, last 
month's leader, dropped to third; Time Zone rose to second. 

Castle Wolfenstein continues to dominate the Strategy Five 
listing with Flight Simulator second and Sargon II third. Flight 
Simulator, for the first time, appears to have a challenger. Air- 
Sim-1, another piloting simulation, made fourth. Rendezvous, 
a space simulation from EduWare, is also making a concerted 
run in the marketplace. 

But right now the market belongfs to Sir-tech; they're sell-
