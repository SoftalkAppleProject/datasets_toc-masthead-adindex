CONTEST: 

'1 WAS A TEENAGE APPLE" 



There once was a computer company in Cu- 
pertino, California, that had lots of Apples ly- 
ing around in its offices. There were all kinds — 
lis. Ills, Lisas, yet-unnamed computers, and an 
old Apple 1 used as a dart board with Peter Mc- 
Williams's picture on it. 

One day, when Steve Jobs was shaving his 
pet gerbil ("If you shave a gerbil, will it get a 
tan?" was Jobs's Zen question of the month), 
Jobs's electric razor caused a power overload, 
which resulted in some of the fuse boxes catch- 
ing fire and burning up several offices. (Sure, it's 
improbable, but this is just a contest.) 

Well, one of the rooms that burned down 
was the Apple Computer Relics room where 
lived an Apple II, a II Plus, a He, a III, and a 
Lisa. All five computers were totally destroyed: 
crispy critters. 

During their lives, each computer wrote 
programs in either assembly language, Cobol, 
Basic, Fortran, or Pascal. No computer could 
write in more than one language, but they all 
could run programs written in any language. 

Each was used for only one function: data- 
base management, adventure games, arcade 
games, fantasy games, or word processing. 
None of the Apples was used for more than one 
application. In other words, the Apple that 
played adventure games did nothing else but 
play Zork, Wizard and the Princess, Mask of the 
Sun, and so on. 

Through some strange turn of events, each 
one of the computers was reincarnated and be- 
came either a doctor, disc jockey, samurai war- 
rior, lawyer, or stand-up comic, and was either 
single, engaged, happily married, happily di- 
vorced, or twice divorced. 

One spring weekend, they all happened to 
meet by chance at the Legal Aspects of One- 
Liner Radio Personalities Impersonating Ear- 
Nose-and-Throat Japanese Soldiers Conven- 
tion at the Motel Six in Cheeseburg, Ohio. 

They really hadn't changed that much, even 
though they were now human and no longer 
computers. Naturally, they immediately recog- 
nized each other and hit it off great. Unfor- 
tunately, they couldn't remember completely 
which computers they were, or what their lives 
were like. But they did know the following: 

1. The Lisa played a lot of Wizardry, Ul- 
tima II, and dungeon games. 

2. The one that used to program in Cobol 
was divorced. 

3. The one that had been a II Plus would 
have to leave the convention early because he 
had a hot date with his financee back home. 

4. One of them bored the rest of the group 
about how he spent weeks trying to get SOS 
commands to execute from assembly language. 

5. The He spoke Cobol. 

6. The former IPs second wife divorced him 
because he wallpapered the bedroom with disks 
full of saved games in progress, all of which he 



was in the process of solving. 

7. The single man didn't speak a high-level 
language. 

8. The one who used to write in Pascal did a 
lot of word processing. 

9. The samurai warrior was a more sophis- 
ticated model Apple, and the lawyer an earlier 
model, than the stand-up comic. 

10. In his previous life, the disc jockey tried 
to combine his interests by writing Ultima XII 
with all goto and print statements, and a whole 
bunch of for-next loops. 

1 1 . The doctor fell asleep listening to 
another guest reminiscing about taking inven- 
tory, collecting axes, and parsing f-words. 

12. The stand-up comic's jokes mostly end- 
ed with punch lines such as "How many fields 
to sort?" and "By last name?" 

These poor bozos couldn't figure out who 
was who, but we bet you can. In fact, we'll give 
away $100 worth of Softaik advertisers' prod- 
ucts to the one who can correctly match all five 
humans with the computers they used to be, the 
language each spoke, the applications each was 
used for, and their current marital status. 

All you have to do is write down the occu- 
pation, marital status, model of Apple that per- 
son used to be, computer language, and its ap- 
plication, and send it in with a facsimile of the 
coupon below. That's it! 

In case of a tie, a winner will be dragged 
screaming from within the ruthless random 
number generator. 

Mail in your entry with the following infor- 
mation, postmarked by October 10, 1983, to 
Softaik Reincarnation, Box 60, North Holly- 
wood, CA 91603. Go! 31

CONTEST WINNERS 

What a mess. The June Final Exam contest 
sent readers scrambling to libraries, wriUng let- 
ters to Apple, and looking up Wozniak's phone 
number in the directory. Needless to say, it 
probably disrupted a lot of innocent people's 
lives. The carnage of contests, oh, the carnage. 

It really wasn't that hard. As we said in the 
rules, all information was at one time or another 
publicly available if you knew where to look. 

He Looked, He Wrote, He Entered, He 
Won. Brian Fleming (Los Altos, CA) knew 
where to look. Fleming's research skills helped 
him answer all but two questions correctly, 
which won him all of $100 in prizes. He says 



ALL NEW GAMES FROM PENGUIN! 



Minit Man by Greg Malone 



When the first wave of robots hit the bridge you were having lunch. By the time 
you cllifibed into your chopper and reached the gorge, the damage was done! The 
bridge was shattered. That was about the time the radio started squawidng about 
Incoming missiles. 

Your siios are empty, awaiting three interceptor missiles that had just been 
prepared for launching. Unfortunately, they are loaded on trains on the other side 
of the gorge, unable to get across the damaged bridge. Your job Is to repair the 
damage and set the launch computer. 

Simultaneously, the enemy's robots have penetrated the building complex In an 
attempt to sabotage the computer. If you don't stop them, saving the bridge 

would be pointless. r^v%ltf <^iO OC

he's going to blow it all on part of a Sweet Mi- 
cro Systems Mockingboard, which he'll pick up 
at his local store, Mission Computer Center. 

It seems that one of the reasons some peo- 
ple enter these contests is just to get their names 
printed in this section of the magazine. Witness 
one entry we received that included the follow- 
ing note. 

"When 1 forgot to double-space my Why 
No! Kumquat? entry, 1 became angry. When I 
forgot to send in my correct count of 349 tur- 
keys, I had a mental breakdown. Not this time! 
1 hope you realize I want my name to appear in 
Softalk, even if it means embarrassment. I'm 
desperate for attention! Please notice my smart- 
alecky answers." 

Whoever you are, you forgot to include 
your name with your entry. Them's the breaks. 

Resourcefulness was the key to this contest. 
Some contestants' references even included the 
corporate librarians at Apple. Larry Glisson 
and Glenn Parrish (Fort Lauderdale, FL) went 
straight to the source, the Woz himself. "We got 
the answers to some of the questions from Steve 
Wozniak (even better than interviewing Steve 
Jobs!)," they wrote. "If you wish to call him, his 
phone number is (408) 946-PQRS. Don't print 
the number, he doesn't want publicity! Please!" 

Killer Questions. Question twenty-seven 
seemed to stump a few people. One person in- 
formed us that Amy Doaks is "Mr. Doaks's 
daughter." Tom Lullo (Naperville, IL) guessed 
"Amy Doaks is Steve Wozniak's fiancee. If this 
guess is right, tell Steve 'Congrats' for me." If 
Lullo's guess is right, somebody should tell 
Wozniak's wife, Candi. 

What color feet does the blue horse have? 
Well, we don't know of too many blue horses; 
the horse on the cover of the June issue was an 
off-white color, and you couldn't see its feet 
anyway. The answer to this one was found in 
the Applesoft Tutorial on pages 85 and 104 for 
the II Plus and He respectively. It didn't matter 
to David Tseng (Marlboro, NJ), who let us 
know very concisely that "horses have hooves, 
not feet." Touche. 

Did everyone find Richard Shacklock's six- 
teenth-century poem? Here's what Kevin Fanes 
(Fresno, CA) sent us: 

"I once had a machyne called 'The 

Computer.' 
It was a perfeckt devyce— a real beaut, sir. 
But I lefte my Apple to lye 
And my wyfe used it in a pye. 
There was only one thing to do: scolde 
her." 

"If you haven't guessed," Fanes added, "I 
don't know the answer to this question, I hate 
poetry, I never heard of Richard Shacklock, 
and 1 wasn't around in 1565!" 

The essay question was just for fun — a big 
chance for people to get their names mentioned 
here for coming up with imaginative answers. 
Unfortunately, not too many people decided to 
have that much fun with it. Most essays explain- 
ing why the Apple is the best darn personal 
computer in the universe sounded like this: "It's 
versatile; it has more software available for it 
than any other; it's expandable; it's the one I 



have; it just is; it's a good bargain for the 
money. . . ." 
Boring. 

Contest winner Fleming decided his own 
reasons were unimportant. "Why is Apple the 
best dam personal computer in the universe? It 
seems quite unnecessary to make up reasons to 
support the statement when so many have said 
it so well: 

'The best stands out' — Howard Software 
Services 

'Dollar for dollar, feature for feature, noth- 
ing else even comes close!'— Sierra On-Line 
'Ya gotta have one'— Sweet Micro Systems 
'Penguins say frnk, frnk'— Penguin 
Software 

"The above statements speak for them- 
selves." 

Aaron and Ben Lanterman (Bridgeton, 
MD) answered the essay question best by stat- 
ing simply that "no one can afford a Lisa." 
Good answer, but try telling that to the back- 
ordered Lisa division at Apple. 

One of the questions that caused the most 
confusion was number eight, the date the first 
Apple II was made available to the public. The 
correct answer to this question depended on 
whom you asked. The official correct answer 
was May 10, 1977. According to Phil Roybal, 
Apple's product marketing manager, Furope, 
and former corporate communications man- 
ager, this was the date it was available for pur- 
chase, hence publicly available. 

However, the Apple II was introduced io the 
public at the First West Coast Computer Faire. 
This is where it gets messy. According to Ap- 
ple's calendar, this all happened on April 20, 
1 977. But Jim Warren, boss of bosses at Com- 
puter Faire, the Faire's sponsor, says Apple is 
lying; in his diary, the West Coast Computer 
Faire took place April 15-17, 1977. You just 
can't take anybody's word anymore. So, if your 
answer was any of these three dates, you're in 
good shape. 

As a closing note, here's what Richard Wins- 
low (Wheatland, WY) had to say about the 
contest "While I'll probably not win, at least 
I've had some fun, met some people, and 
learned something more about my Apple." 
Isn't that what it's all about anyway? 
An End to This Limerick Madness. Funny 
thing about voting. No matter who wins, al- 
most nobody is satisfied. Presidential elections, 
legislation. World Series most valuable players, 
limerick contests. 

The only person who'll be satisfied with the 
outcome of this contest is Sonia Kantor (Palo 
Alto, CA), whose limerick received the most 
votes and won by a landslide. It wasn't even a 
close race. Her limerick was number four, 
which ended with "Hugh, let Pa curd the 
whey" (hidden name: Hewlett-Packard). 

Kantor wins the long-awaited $100 in fabu- 
lous gift items for her Apple, which, no doubt, 
son Jason will help pick out. Jason Kantor, 
the contest-winners faithful will remember, was 
crowned Softalk Slob of the Month back in 
May for having submitted his Puns 'n' Ana- 
grams entry with torn and frayed edges.

smeared ink, grease stains, and other grimy 
marks. Since then, that title has been revoked, 
and all rights and privileges that go with it have 
been canceled. Sonia Kantor explains: 

"Jason was kind of upset at first, because it 
wasn't all his fault. We would all work on the 
puzzle after dinner just about every night, and it 
was my husband who made most of the mess." 
Only after some school chums remarked to Ja- 
son that they had seen his name in Softalk did 
the former Slob of the Month realize it wasn't 
such a bad deal after all. 

Lessons like this are always learned too late, 
and such is the case for Jason. The Slob of the 
Month for May has now been defaulted to his 
father, Robert. 

Winning a contest always involves a bit of 
talent, luck, and a little strategy. In the case of 
the Limerick contest, it involved a lot of strat- 
egy. See, just as in real-life stuff like political 
elections, there's always the matter of who 
should have won, who wanted badly to win, and 
who did win. Kantor did win, that much is cer- 
tain. But how she did it is another story. 

The voting looked more like the petitioning 
process for Dr. Demento's Top Ten than it did 
a civil democratic event. Votes came in for every 
limerick, but in the final analysis it wasn't a 
question of which limerick was the best written 
or the most popular, but rather who could 
round up the most people to send in a post card 
with a number written on it. 

All but four of Kantor's votes came from 
her home-town area of Palo Alto. At first, the 
contest staff was stumped. "She sure has a lot of 
neighbors," remarked one vote counter. "Either 
that or she's holding a lot of Palo Altoans hos- 
tage," added another. 

it was neither case. 

As Kantor tells it, all the votes came in from 
students of her English as a Second Language 
class. The limericks were given to the students (or 
so we were told), and they were to vote for lim- 
erick number four "if they wanted to pass the 
class." Well, that's one way to campaign for 
votes, and it doesn't seem too different from the 
way things work in Congress. 

Congratulations are in order to Kantor for 
going beyond her job duties of teaching the 
English language and teaching the true Ameri- 
can way as well. Hurrah. 

For each devious action, there is an equal 
and opposite reaction. Sort of. When it came 
time to draw from the pile of cards that voted 
for limerick number four in order to award the 
$50 voters' prize, the card that emerged was one 
of the four that didn't come from Palo Alto. It 
was one of three that came from Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin. At least this winner wasn't one of 
Kantor's Kommandos. So we thought. 

No, Ellen Lang (Milwaukee, WI) isn't one 
of Kantor's English students. She's a sister-in- 
law. Nepotism, nepotism. Lang doesn't have an 
Apple, so she really had no use for $50 in soft- 
ware. Instead, she's taking the cash and will 
"put it toward our trip to Europe." That ought 
to buy her enough airplane fare to get about six 
miles over the Atlantic.

Fastalk is a quick guide to popular, specialized, 
new, and classic software. When you need a particu- 
lar kind of program or just want to see what's new, 
Fastalk is the place to look for fast answers. 

If a program has been reviewed in So/talk, it car- 
ries the issue date of the review in italics at the end of 
its listing, and the capsule description given reflects 
the published review. 

A new software entry, which must be of profes- 
sional quality to be included, is designated by a check 
mark preceding its name. A new entry loses its check 
mark after its first appearance and drops out of 
Fastalk after one to three appearances (depending on 
genre) if it fails to gain popularity. 

A bullet preceding a title indicates a program that 
Softalk has designated as a classic, based on its ability 
to stand up over time, its significance for its time 
(breaking new ground or introducing a new genre), or 
its archetypal qualities. 

Other entries in Fastalk are there either by virtue 
of current activity (the programs are selling at least as 
much as the least-selling entry on any of the bestseller 
charts) or because they are representative of the best 
of programs for a special interest or need (such as 
card games or non-Basic-specific language terminal 
programs). 

Softalk may arbitrarily omit any package from 
Fastalk, whether or not it meets the foregoing 
criteria.

Quark introduces 

A deceptively simple solution 
to your word processing dilemma. 



If you're serious about word processing on 
your Appie*lle, you may be bewildered by the 
sheer number of programs available. And a 
tad perplexed by their claims and promises. 
After all, a glamorous package that says "easy 
to use," may not even be easy to open. 

The dilemma is real. And Quark is happy to 
provide the solution. 

A proven program for serious 
word processing. 

Quark's new Word Juggler lie turns your 
computer into a dedicated word processor. 
You get the extraordinary ease of use, sophis- 
ticated capabilities and straightforward docu- 
mentation that make our original Word Juggler 
a best seller on the Apple III. 

For example, there's virtually nothing to 
memorize. Because principal editing functions 
are identified on a unique keyboard template 



— and nineteen, easy-to-install, replacement 
keycaps. 

Changing keys is quick and simple, too. Just 
slide our special keycap remover over the key 

— twist — and pull. Your new keycaps can be 
in place in less than two minutes. 

A flexible tool to increase your 
productivity. 

But don't be deceived by Word Juggler He's 
disarming simplicity. The program packs the 
powerful features you need to quickly perform 
the most complex editing tasks. 

Characters, words, even entire paragraphs 
can be deleted with a single keystroke. There 
are search and replace keys. Block move and 
copy keys. And you always have instant con- 
trol over page length, margins and any other 
formatting parameters. 

Document display and print out are easy, 
also. One keystroke displays your document 
on the screen. Another prints it. And whether 




Word Juggler lie 



you need to print only specific pages, multiple 
copies, or even documents too large to fit in 
memory, Word Juggler lie can easily accom- 
modate you. 

A clever way to foil Mr. Murphy. 

Even the best of us occasionally forgets 
when "i" does not come before "e" — and 
even the most agile fingers can press the wrong 
key. So you should also give serious consider- 
ation to Quark's new Lexicheck^^ lie — a spell- 
ing checker with a highly compressed, 50,000 
word dictionary. 

Accessed from within the word processor, 
this program lets you virtually eliminate typo- 
graphical errors and common misspellings. 
Lexicheck lie will scan your document at up to 
8,000 wpm — then highlight, in context, the 
first occurrence of any word it does not 
recognize. 

If the word is correct, as in the case of in- 
dustry jargon or abbreviations, you can simply 
add it to your personal dictionary. If the word is 
actually misspelled, you can swiftly correct it. 



A lot more. 

These are only some of the ways Word 
Juggler lie and Lexicheck lie can help solve 
your word processing dilemma. Your Quark 
dealer has even more details, as well as com- 
plete information on our line of office automa- 
tion tools for the Apple III.

System Saver " 

The most important peripheial foi' y<^ 




For Line Surge Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides es- 
sential protection to hardware and 
data from dangerous power surges 
and spikes. 




Volls 
RMS 



SYSTEM SAVER 
APPLE II 



For Cooling 

As soon as you add 80 columns or 
more memory to your Apple II you 
need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral 
cards generate more heat. In addi- 
tion, the cards block any natural air 
flow through the Apple n creating 
high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the Life of the 
cards and the computer itself. 



For Operating Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two 
switched power outlets. As shown 
m the diagram, the SYSTEM 
SAVER efficiently organizes your 
system so that one convenient, 
front mounted 
power switch 
controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple H, 
monitor and printer. 



MONITOR 








APPLE 11 



Available in 220/240 Volt. 50 Hz 



By connecting the Apple II 
power input through the SYSTEM 
SAVER, power is controlled m two 
ways: 1) Dangerous voltage spikes 
are clipped off at a safe 130 Volts 
RMS/175 Volts dc level. 2) High fre- 
quency noise is smoothed out be- 
fore reachmg the Apple H. A PI type 
filter attenuates common mode 
noise signals by a minimum of 
30 dB from 600 khz to 20 mhz, with 
a maximum attenuation of 50 dB . 




SYSTEM SAVER provides cor- 
rect cooling . An efficient, quiet fan 
draws fresh air across the mother 
board, over the power supply and 
out the side ventilation slots. 



The heavy duty switch has a 
pilot light to alert when system is 
on .You'll never use the Apple power 
switch again! 



Easy Installation 



Compatible with Apple Stand 



Just clips on. 
No mounting or 
hardware required. 
Color matched 
to Apple n.

AMPERGRAPH is a powerful, easy-to-use 
relocatable graphics utility for the Apple II +le. 
AMPERGRAPH adds twenty-two Applesoft com- 
mands that allow effortless generation of profes- 
sional-looking plots of scientific or financial data. All

Superstandards 

I am prompted to write after spending the bet- 
ter part of a year owning and playing with, as 
time permits, an Apple II Plus. My play con- 
sists of trying to find the all-purpose system for 
my business. During this process I have read 
everything I could get my hands on, talked with 
whomever would respond, and shopped at five 
or six places here in Tampa. My criteria for 
such a system are high. 

Although 1 now have a small kaleidoscope- 
and-stained-glass business, I used to work on 
mainframe beasts as a social-science consult- 
ant. This position meant knowing an excessive 
amount about relatively nothing (esoteric acad- 
emese). However, the packages I dealt with 




s I o n 



were integrated systems featuring high-level lan- 
guage components and reasonably high-level 
detailed functioning — meaning a little manipu- 
lation would get a lot of information and a fair 
amount of detailed control over analyzing it. 

Now I wish to have the all-purpose small- 
computer complete turnkey business system. 
Sorry if my criteria are high, but I can't settle 
for anything less and get the kind of perform- 
ance that is usable. I refuse to buy into any- 
thing less than a single transaction-based sys- 
tem, where I can key in a customer's name once 
and only once. I don't want to have to add the 
same name multiple times to a correspondence 
file, an invoice file, an inventory file, a word 
processor business card file, or whatever else 
might be needed. I can't get an improvement in 
efficiency if I duplicate my paperwork system. I 
need to condense to a single transaction-based 
system, that's all. 

My criteria are as follows: All components 
of the system should be readily modifiable and 
all modules should be integrated, meaning that 
files be open and accessible to all modules in- 
cluded in the package or written by the user; a 
high-level language permitting easy modifica- 
tion and module development should be used; 
the system should entail a database, modules 
for general ledger, accounts receivable, ac- 
counts payable, inventory and point of sale, 
payroll, word processing and mailing labels, 
and the ability to communicate with other ma- 
chines, databases, and files created in other lan- 
guages; graphics should be an integral part of 
the word processing features; and, of course, 
modules should permit easy specification for 
different types of business. 

I offer these criteria as a reference for busi- 
ness-software evaluators, who might consider 
ranking products along these lines, and for 
product manufacturers who are welcome to bid, 
offer, or sell me their products to the extent that 
they meet these standards. I applaud the efforts 
made so far. With little money, slow disk drives, 
and a volatile market, it's a wonder so much ex- 
ists that is so good. But it's not enough. 

Here is a running commentary on some 
packages I've looked at. Savvy ranks quite high 
on many of my criteria, but it fails because all 
data and all modules must be keyed in, and it 
doesn't access any other types of files, data- 
bases, or machines. WordStar, dBase II, and 
Mailmerge rank high, but for me, I figure I 
might as well buy a Z-80-based machine with all 
these bundled in, rather than add them to my 
Apple. I'm not terribly happy with all the Pas- 
cal-ba.sed stuff, nor am I impressed with Apple 
Pascal's reliability or the practicality of the p- 
System transportability. BPI and its ilk are too 
special purpose, and Multiplan and VisiCalc are 



A Satisfying Set of Tools 

For many years it has been my practice to con- 
sider the likelihood of repeated use of any tool I 
might purchase. For a one-time applicaUon I 
might choose the least expensive tool for the 
job, but for continued use I choose quality and 
pay the price. That philosophy has paid off, and 
today I have a lot of dependable tools. 

Not the least of these, by any means, is 
dBase II. I had been looking for software that 
would handle the paperwork for the small busi- 
ness that my wife and I were running from our 
home. As a beginning amateur programmer, I 
was mildly shocked at the idea of learning a new 
language when I didn't even know Applesoft 
Basic yet, but it was apparent that dBase would 
do the job. 

Things went well for nearly two years, and 
several people have purchased dBase on my 
recommendation. A few days ago, though, I ran 
into a problem in building a form on my new 
He. My dBase dealer was baffled and so was my 
Apple dealer. In desperation I called Ashton- 
Tate, publisher of dBase, I was given the num- 
ber of the company's technical advice staff and 
was handed over to Kevin Shepherd. Mr. Shep- 
herd understood my problem the first time I 
went through it. He then led me through an in- 
stallation patch, which I managed to botch. I 
called him back the next day and he patiently 
led me through it again. This Ume I got it right 
and everything works now. It was a real comfort 
to be able to talk to someone who treated me as 
if I were the only person in the world who had a 
problem. 

Ashton-Tate is to be congratulated for 
building a first-class organization to support a 
first-class software package.

On Easy Street 

After using a checkbook program called Money 
Street for about a month I just had to tell every- 
one that it's the best program I have ever seen. I 
was almost six months into the year when I got 
Money Street and I already had all three of my 
checking accounts on another program. I really 
intended to wait until next January to begin us- 
ing it. After reading the manual and trying out 
the tutorial, I just couldn't wait. I entered all six 
months' worth of back checks from all three 
accounts. 

The program has proved that the hype of 
the Money Street ad is really too modest. How 
many programs do you own about which you 
can say that you can't think of anything you 
would like to see improved? The program raises 
the standard of the term user-friendly for the 
rest of the industry. All information is available 
at all times, and there are no monthly closings. 
Anything can be changed at any time, and all 
dependent balances and totals are instantly ad- 
justed. I do mean instantly — everything in this 
program is fast. The report options are exten- 
sive, and bank reconciliation is almost fun.

Covering the Bases 

I started my database search with CCA Data 
Management, distributed at the time by Per- 
sonal Software/VisiCorp. I learned a lot 
through the basic user interface suggestions and 
helps included. After getting several business 
programs on-board, I felt the need for a more 
advanced database system — specifically, 
the newer screen-editing functions to enhance 
data entry, as well as some kind of break from 
sorting. I gave VisiFile a short trial, which 
seemed to go in the right direction for screen 
editing, but the sorts were too closely akin to 
CCA. Also, my upgrade cost to get into the new 
program by the same supplier was about one 
hundred fifty dollars. The upgrade policy got 
my goat. 

I moved to DB Master and then bought the 
Utility Pak #/. The screen editing was there, 
with the ability to make the entry screens and 
the database appear the way I wanted. The 
"auto-sort-on-entry-by-key-fields" functions of 
this database freed me of most sorting (it was al- 
ready there). I also felt that many of the data 
handling routines were aided by machine lan- 
guage, which gave an overall performance jump 
from where I had been. I could not get the da- 
tabase to do everything I needed, so the Utility 
Pak #7 was necessary to DIP (Data Inter- 
change Format) data from DB Master to a DIP 
text file for user processing. I grew to hate that 
slow and awkward transfer process. The pro- 
grams were locked and so was the data, and 
DIP was the only door to get in and out other 
than the keyboard. Give me back my data! 

General Manager, by Sierra On-Line, 
claimed to have all the features of a first-class 
database, with direct access to the data for read- 
ing, entry, or editing from Applesoft Basic with 
user interface commands (using & calls to exe- 
cute fast General Manager routines from your 
own programs). The original price was $100, 
which made it harder to believe, but a phone 
call confirmed that they thought it really did 
what they claimed. I bought it and decided 
shortly that it was the best option yet (a sleep- 
er). I was disappointed in the original version's 
reporting functions, but otherwise extremely 
pleased on all counts. One upgrade cost me 
about five dollars during the process, and then 
version 2.0 came out with a completely new 
manual (super) and new reporting functions 
along with other general enhancements. (Sur- 
prise — no need to change user programs; it 
worked with any obsolete command format of 
the old system, as well as the new ones.) This 
major upgrade cost twenty-five dollars and was 
quite a buy, considering that it upgraded my 
system to the new $229.95 version. I suspected 
on purchase that Sierra On-Line would take 
care of me on upgrades because of what I had 
heard about the company's policy on Super- 
scribe to Screen Writer upgrades. 

How about the lock? You must boot with 



an original program disk on first boot. After the 
master is booted, you can use a copy of the 
original disk. You can load, li.st, and change the 
basic routines of the General Manager pro- 
grams if you're so inclined. The basic interface 
has enabled me to do anything I want to with 
the data — even if it's outside the design of the 
database. I can do most of it with & calls to fast 
machine language subroutines, for everything 
from data reading to print using. 

I am extremely pleased with the lock, data 
access, and upgrade experiences I have had with 
this program.

A Prompt Response 

I am writing to tell readers about the Microtek 
Dumpling 64 Graphics card. I recently pur- 
chased one from my computer supply shop and 
found that one of the chips was not functioning 
properly with my home accounting program. I 
called the Microtek people, who were aware of 
the problem, and they immediately sent out a 
new chip for replacement. That's exactly the 
kind of service that warrants comment from a 
satisfied user. Unfortunately, I have found that 
other suppliers are not as cooperative as Micro- 
tek. When one shops for equipment, one should 
consider the after-sale service. I will surely con- 
sider other Microtek products when it comes to 
buying additional items for my Apple. 
Lawrence I. Stern, Claremont, CA 

Two Good Buys 

I have used The Accountant for several months 
this year and have had several occasions to cor- 
respond with Decision Support Software. Por 
those who need more than a check-register pro- 
gram, including asset and liability manage- 
ment, flexibility to tailor applications (home 
and/or business), and a comprehensive Visi- 
Calc interface. The Accountant may be just the 
thing. In all fairness, it is not suitable for be- 
ginners or those who don't have a clear applica- 
tion defined. 

The program includes a sample data file, 
produces a balance sheet with a couple of key- 
strokes, and grows with the user's needs. I use 
more than fifty accounts and twenty-four codes 
for tax summaries. I have chosen to upgrade to 
the larger business version in order to have au- 
tomatic check-numbering in the posting of au- 
tomatic transactions. I commend the manufac- 
turer on its support, both by phone and in up- 
grade turnarounds. 

As to shortcomings. The A ccountant can use 
some improvement in its on-screen prompting. 
For example, the user needs to remember the 
commands for split transactions for entry into 
the desk-calculator mode and how to quit when 
it is appropriate. The program includes com- 
prehensive printed reports, a couple of which 
use too much paper. A command-summary 
card would reduce this awkwardness some- 
what. While there is a graphics-display mode, it 
is unsealed and not very useful. All in all, it is a 
well-thought-out system that I predict will con- 
tinue to find satisfied users.

processor to PIE Writer version 2.2. There is 
new documentation and the program now in- 
cludes a two-disi( system. With it the program 
can be configured to taice advantage of the 
Apple II or lie, as well as forty and eighty col- 
umn computer configurations. PIE Writer is 
underrated in my opinion. Hayden does not 
seem to be taking advantage of its potential. 
The program uses the 16K RAM card (if pres- 
ent) to load both modules so that they're co- 
resident. This makes document previewing very 
convenient. The system is very fast in searches 
and allows both freeform and formatted entry. 
What you see is what you print. While interfac- 
ing with various printers can be a problem for 
many programs, PIE Writer provides default 
initialization, the capability to embed an un- 



limited number of control characters for the 
printer, and the capability of addressing a cus- 
tom printer driver. As to shortcomings, I would 
say only that in my several years' experience I 
have not yet begun to use all the capabilities of 
PIE Writer.

Applefest Hits and Misses 

I would like to comment on the Apple- 
fest held at Anaheim, California, earlier this 
year. I have both a positive and a negative com- 
ment about the fest. On the positive side, it was 
nice to see Apple wares at every booth. At many 
of the computer expositions I have attended, it 
seems as though very few of the displays deal 
with Apple products.

On the negative side, I had a list of fourteen 
companies in whose products I was interested. 
While I enjoyed seeing all the displays, my real 
reason for attending the Applefest was to see 
certain products that I had not been able to find 
in the local computer stores or about which I 
had hoped to get more detailed information di- 
rectly from the source. 

Of the fourteen companies on my list, only 
four (Apple Computer, Call -A.P.P.L.E., Ex- 
ecutive Peripheral Systems, and Penguin) were 
actually at the show. Among the missing were 
Beagle Bros, Business Solutions, Tver, Videx, 
Microtek, Control Data, H.O.M.E., and Syn- 
ergistic Software. I realize not every company 
can attend every exposition, but it certainly 
would be nice if there were some way at least 
one of the major Apple publications could pub- 
lish a list of those companies that were ex- 
pected to attend each Applefest.

A Jumpy Reaction 

It's nice to know that Softalk's game reviewer 
has managed to retain his sense of humor in this 
day and age. It's less fortunate that he's used an 
excellent arcade game as his comic vehicle. The 
game is Jump Jet, and I heartily suggest that 
readers see the game for themselves — with the 
So/talk review in hand. That way, players can 
have the last laugh when they try to compare 
the review to the game. They'll learn what hun- 
dreds of software dealers already know — Jump 
Jet is action-packed and exciting. 

The reviewer seems to be a clever writer, but 
a poor researcher. He attributed the jet's abil- 
ity to take off and land vertically to poor pro- 
gramming, rather than to the capabilities of the 
Harrier jets upon which the game is founded. 
And this is just one example. 

As the president of Avant-Garde, the pub- 
lisher of Jump Jet, I suggest that our two com- 
panies join efforts to create an adventure game 
in which the readers try to find their way 
through the review and, if successful, arrive at 
an actual understanding of the game. It could 
be the hottest seller on the market — but I'm not 
sure what kind of review it would receive.

Turning It Over in His Mind 

After reading reviews of Miner 2049er and 
seeing the game played I knew that I really 
wanted it. I shelled out the bucks at my local 
computer store, brought it home, and booted it 
up. The game worked beautifully. I loved the 
way it allowed me to set the controls to my own 
joystick (which is a new Hayes Mach III that 
just might be the best joystick out right now). 
Then, when I got to playing it, I was even more 
thrilled at the smooth, fast graphics. So it went 
for about two weeks. I gradually worked my 
way through the levels, totally amazed at the 
quality of programming. It even occurred to me 
that Miner might make a good quarter-eating 
arcade game. 

Finally, I gained the tenth level. Proud of 
my achievement, I continued to try to conquer 



SEPTEMBER 1983

the nasty level. After many days of labor, 1 suc- 
ceeded in filling in all the platforms. I already 
knew that there were only ten different screens, 
so I expected to see the first level again. To my 
amazement, I found myself going to level I 
instead of level 11.1 thought that this little over- 
sight by the programmers was not too much of 
a problem. Still, when I saw the screen, nothing 
at all had changed: not the placement of the 
mutants, nor the apples, nor the time. It was as 
if I had started the game over. But I was still 
only slightly taken aback by this total lack of 
change. I continued to play on through the 
levels, watching my score climb to superhigh 
levels. It was then that the game started to 
bother me. When my score reached 100,000 the 
game considered it to be zero. This in itself was 
not too surprising if you consider that the game 
has only five digits for scoring. Anyway, when I 
finally died and it came time to view the much- 
coveted top five list, I found that the game 
hadn't even acknowledged the fact that I had 
turned it over. This was the final blow. 

In my opinion, there seems to have been a 
total lack of foresight by the author and pub- 
lisher of Miner 2049er.

A Professional Opinion 

As a physician with a good deal of experience in 
computer-assisted medical instruction, I was 
fascinated by the enthusiastic review in the June 
Softalk of Microbe and consequently bought 
the program. I couldn't agree more with the 
praise for Microbe as "a graphic tour de force." 

However, after using the game for several 
weeks, I find that the claim made for Microbe as 
an educational tool for physicians and medical 
students is unjustified. While the program does 
contain useful information, its distortion of 
anatomy and its simplistic "cookbook" ap- 
proach to treatment make it unsuitable for 
serious medical teaching. Those who purchase 
Microbe as a game will be entertained; those 
(especially medical students and physicians) 
who buy it as a learning aid will have been 
misled.

Just Rewards for the Rescue? 

I have recently read of a few game players com- 
plaining about games in which there is a ceiling 
score. Choplifter is a good example. No matter 
how hard you try, you can only rescue sixty- 
four world delegates held hostage. I can shoot 
all the tanks and planes (let's not forget the 
mines) and never get any points for them. 

All I can say is that I agree with Margot 
Tommervik in July's "The Art and Craft of the 
Game" article, where this issue was mentioned. 
If points were awarded for the tanks, players 
would just let the hostages explore the country- 
side while destroying tanks for extra points. 
Choplifter was not intended as a tank battle. 
It was intended as a rescue mission; there- 
fore points are awarded only for saving the 
hostages. 

To those people who complain, just come 
back when you have saved all sixty-four dele- 



gates. It took me a while, but I've done it. To 
keep those out there who haven't rescued all 
sixty-four in mystery, I won't tell you how the 
game ends, but it's best not to get your hopes 
up. On the box it says that if you rescue all the 
hostages there will be world peace. I would have 
thought with all that extra disk space (Chop- 
lifter doQsn\ use the entire disk) that for a finale 
Broderbund would boot a world peace demo, 
cartoon, picture, or even congratulations. This 
would encourage players who have rescued all 
the delegates to want to try again. It's unfor- 
tunate — I hardly play the game now because 
completing it (and beating the computer) is un- 
rewarding. 

Alan Dundas, Pittsford, NY 
Shakedown Time 

I would like to comment on the "flat" software 
sales that Softalk has been reporting the past 
few months. I bought one of the first Apple II 
Plus computers in 1979 and since have bought 
four more for use where I work. I have bought 
fifty-five commercial software packages, search- 
ing for ones that will be useful. Sadly, most are 
gathering dust. The novelty has worn off and 
the frustration has set in. 

I am on strike! I refuse to buy any more 
Apple software, with a few exceptions. What I 
object to is having the software locked up so I 
can't see how the calculations are made, can't 
correct the problems, and can't solve the equip- 
ment interfacing. I have word processors that 
can't send the proper commands to my printer. 
One graphics program will send graphics out- 
put only to the Silentype or Qume. (1 don't have 
either.) My latest fiasco was buying a $500 disk 
emulator card. I thought that since my data- 
base manager used standard DOS 3.3 data 
disks, I could mount the data disk in the emula- 
tor in order to speed up record searches and 
read/writes. Nope! When I load the database 
program, the custom DOS clobbers the disk 
emulator software, which works only with 
DOS 3.3. 

Even if all the interfaces in a software pack- 
age are okay when I buy it, I find in a year or so 
that I can't add equipment without creating sys- 
tem conflicts. Since the code is locked up, I can't 
correct even the slightest problem, and even a 
trivial change becomes a fatal flaw. This is no 
longer acceptable — I just won't buy any more. 

A big shakedown has started in the com- 
puter industry, and I predict that Apple and all 
its supporting vendors will feel the crunch un- 
less they change. Atari found out last Christmas 
that there is a limited market for $30 games. 
The people at Texas Instruments just dropped 
$100 million to find out they couldn't lock up 
all their computers for themselves. One of the 
most important insights the two Steves gave the 
original Apple was to open up the guts so that 
people could see how it worked and tailor it to 
their needs. Are the software vendors going to 
follow TI's example and keep all their secrets, or 
are they going to provide software and interfac- 
ing information so we can use the Apple? With 
the wide variety of software and hardware for 
the Apple in almost infinite combinations, it is 



intolerable to have each software package have 
its own sy.stem that only the author can change. 

I read in the ^all Street Journal ihul Micro- 
soil and fourteen Japanese computer makers 
have agreed on a standardized software format 
that will be interchangeable in all their prod- 
ucts. I see that Coleco is going to sell a com- 
puter with a daisy-wheel printer and word proc- 
essor software for $600. The company is also 
going to have a version of Microsoft's Multi- 
plan for "about $50." Apple has had a stan- 
dard software system for some time. It consists 
of DOS 3.3, binary, and Applesoft for you ven- 
dors who need to know. Why don't you use 
them? 

1 don't buy the argument that holds that 
copy protection is necessary. I bought my first 
copy of VisiCalc for $80 in 1980 from an Apple 
dealer. VisiCalc listed for $100 then. You can't 
tell me they haven't gotten a satisfactory return 
on the investment of their time, or that they need 
to charge $250 now. If copying is so serious, 
how come VisiCalc remains on top, even 
though it could be copied by any of the bit 
copiers? If this were really a problem, wouldn't 
everyone in the world have a copy by now? 
Couldn't it also be true that VisiCalc remains 
on top because most people would prefer to 
have a registered copy and original documenta- 
tion? And how about Penguin's Graphics Ma- 
gician, which is a top seller and is unprotected? 
(Bless them; Magician was one I bought last 
year!) 

There are about seven hundred fifty thou- 
sand Apples out now. If a vendor sold 10 per-

cent of these owners a package for $20, that 
would represent $150,000 in sales! Isn't that 
enough for any program? Is Penguin the only 
one that understands this arithmetic? 

1 foresee the day when a computer software 
store will be like a bookstore. Sure, a bookstore 
has hardbacks at $20 and a few coffee-table 
books at $50. but the bulk of its sales and prof- 
its are from the $3.95 paperbacks. A few people 
will buy $40 games, but I won't. I can't afford 
$100 programs for personal use and won't buy 
them for business use until the locks come off. 
Time just costs too much to mess with all the 
problems. Software sales would not be "flat" if 
you could get a big assortment that included a 
word processor, spreadsheet, database, com- 
munications package, all programming util- 
ities, graphics, and a dozen good arcade and 
graphics games — all working together on a 
common file system and not costing more than 
$400 total! 

Impossible, you say? Keep in mind that at 
$400 an Apple, this would amount to about 
$30 million. 

If Apple owners were assured of getting a 
big pile of good software, with more to come 
each year, they would feel they were getting 
continuing value for their investment. How are 
all those people who are buying computers (but 
not buying much software) going to view their 
purchases after the newness wears off? Will the 
computers gather dust because their owners 
didn't find them as useful as expected? I think 
greed, expensive marketing, and ignoring the 



non-Apple competition is severely limiting the 
usefulness of the Apple computer and is going 
to cause the bubble to burst for Apple, just hke 
it did for Atari and TI. 

The final question is, will the name on the 
software store of the future be Apple or Hi- 
tachisan? I have a large investment in Apple 
equipment and in time spent learning to use it — 
but I am also reading ads for other computer 
systems!

The Novel Approach 

About the Apple Business Basic Reference Man- 
ual — it is poorly written and rarely illustrates 
the subject matter with examples. It is wordy 
and not written as a set of instructions but as a 
novel. That includes both volumes. 

Writing to Apple about it is like throwing 
the letter out the window. If you call, they don't 
call back. I suppose with Lisa available now, 
they just don't care about the Apple III. 

On the positive side, Taylor Pohlman's 
Third Basic is really excellent.

An Intelligence Test 

Only very rarely does an article seem to sum up 
decades of experience with the perceptive in- 
sider's point of view that characterized Jean 
Varven's discussion of the educational uses of 
microcomputers in Schoolhouse Apple, June 
Softalk. 

The potential value of microcomputers for 



educational uses goes beyond the wildest 
dreams of the science-fiction writers. Except for 
the direct teaching of programming (or the 
computer's own seductive capture of its stu- 
dents) and the more recent teaching of word 
processing in business classes, the benefits 
spoken of have been meager indeed. 

I don't want to belittle these applications, as 
any kind of computer access profoundly 
changes the lives of the students it reaches. At 
the same time we need to realize that there are 
many more important educational applications 
that can happen only if someone shows the way. 

I understand that Apple is making a realis- 
tic effort in this area, though I have seen no 
published material on its program. 

There are so many subtle realities in the 
computing field, and we desperately need to 
focus more of our top intelligence on the sec- 
ondary effects. Three decades into the com- 
puter age, we should be acknowledging the 
fundamental truths: that the available creative 
intelligence must be used more wisely, and that 
every possible effort must be made to expand 
our intelligence resources. 
Joe Fulford, Pacifica, CA 

Experiment in Optimism 

I look forward to Softalk's Hardtalk col- 
umn every month. It covers an area about 
which I know nearly nothing. In a recent dis- 
cussion of monitors, it's mentioned that video 
incompatibility usually prevents linking the 
Apple with other NTSC standard equipment 
such as VHS-format video recorders. 

With the innocence of the amateur that I 
am, 1 awoke one morning early (to beat the 
patter of little feet) and hooked up a portable 
RCA Selectavision video recorder (VGP 170) to 
the Apple, connecting the monitor cable from 
the computer to the auxiliary video input of the 
recorder. I ran about twenty minutes of the 
Vagabondo program Fire Organ, one of the 
most colorful and visually interesting programs 
1 know. When I played the recording back 
through our color TV, I was astonished at the 
vividness, resolution, and overall quality of the 
recording. The colors were faithful and sharp. 

I am not sure of the practical applications of 
this. Certainly twenty minutes of watching Fire 
Organ, as pretty as it is, has obvious limita- 
tions. On the other hand, I did want to share my 
experience with other readers who may have 
been put off experimenting by the pessimistic 
tone of that part of the Hardtalk article.

A Zardax To Grind 

I wonder if there might have been an omission 
in the word processing section of the July 
Fastalk column? Zardax wasn't listed! My in- 
quiry is based upon a great respect for this 
product and a sense of social justice. 

In the last four years I have used nearly a 
dozen word processors and have become a very 
tough critic. As such, I strongly believe Zardax 
should remain in the list. I have been in posi- 
tions requiring me to write extensively and I 
find this program to be quick and transparent

to my creative bursts. More important, 1 have 
trained more than a dozen secretaries to use 
word processing systems, and I find Zardax to 
be the most easily learned. 

In addition to an extensive set of editing and 
processing functions, it has some subtle 
strengths that are not immediately evident. It is 
very reliable under heavy use. It uses standard 
sequential text files, which provides a good de- 
gree of data interchange both into and out of 
Zardax. In addition, it is compatible with a 
wide assortment of peripherals and is often up- 
dated by the mother company to grow with 
product advances. The distributor has given me 
prompt, friendly support through phone calls 
and correspondence. 

Less tangibly, I have a sense of creativity 
with Zardax; it allows me to compose at the 
keyboard, as well as to design creative text lay- 
outs. Since there is a simple way to embed non- 
printing ASCII codes, the program can ac- 
commodate almost any printer's cryptic con- 
trol codes. 

I work in a community college where I en- 
counter the needs of faculty, secretaries, stu- 
dents, and administrators. All have different 
needs, and all are well served by Zardax with a 
minimum of training. Here, productivity is the 
issue. I know there are cheaper text editors and 
word processors, but they are terribly expen- 
sive when time is valuable or dependability 
critical. 

Softalk is very influential and thus morally 
bound to present aces as aces and jacks as jacks. 
The inclusion of Zardax in Fastalk will help 
users become more discriminating consumers 
when they make comparisons.

A Savior of Lives, Files, and Your Time 

The June Open Discussion contained a letter 
from Dick Rettke warning of possible prob- 
lems with Diversi-DOS not verifying data after 
writing to the disk. When I wrote Diversi-DOS, 
I considered this very carefully. With almost 
two thousand copies of Diversi-DOS sold, this 
has not caused any problems at all. And, be- 
lieve me, if people start losing their data, I'm go- 
ing to hear about it! 

First of all, let me explain what DOS 3.3 
does that Diversi-DOS doesn't. DOS 3.3 auto- 
matically does a verify command after every 
save or bsave. Diversi-DOS skips this automat- 
ic verify. However, you can still get the very 
same effect by typing the verify manually (or 
adding it to your program) whenever you save 
or bsave. 

Standard DOS 3.3 does not do an auto- 
matic verify after writing text files. When you 
are running a program, most of the writing on 
the disk is done to text files, not Basic or binary 
files. That is, most of the writing to disk is al- 
ready done without verifying, and it works 
reliably. 

The reason this works is that writing a sec- 
tor to disk first requires reading the disk to find 
the locafion of the sector. If the disk is bad, you 
usually can't find the sector location, so you get

POWERTEXT. 

The Word Processing 
System For 
Professionals. 




All across the nation. PowerText has 
become the prime word processing sys- 
tem for professionals. 

Businesspeople. Writers. Attorneys. Edu- 
cators. Men and women who demand a 
level of performance not available from the 
mass- market word processors. 

If you require a true high-performance 
system, consider PowerText. 

Formatting is fully automatic. 

PowerText prints the most complex doc- 
uments—from business letters to dramatic 
scripts to legal documents packed with 
footnotes— precisely consistent with the for- 
mats you define. You need never worry 
about printed style as you write. Yet you 
always get perfectly formatted documents. 

It's almost like dictating to your 
computer. 

Wtien you prepare outlines, question- 
naires, and reports, PowerText can auto- 
matically indent and assign numbers to 
your paragraphs (Roman or Arabic numer- 
als, or alphanumerics, as you direct.) 

There's a full complement of editing fea- 
tures. Including "nested" editing, equiva- 
lent to split-screen editing. 

You get built-in form letter capability 

Remarkably versatile columnar 
capabilities. 

User-definable function keys. 

And far more. 

Yet for all its power and sophistication, 
PowerText is remarkably easy to learn and 
operate. The system includes an excellent 
10-lesson tutorial and a reference manual. 

We'll send you complete details. 

It IS impossible to describe all of Power- 
Text's many valuable features here. But 
we'll be pleased to send you detailed infor- 
mation, including many samples of actual 
PowerText output. 

Just write us a note, or phone us. 

(Or you may wish to send for the tutorial 
and manual. The cost is $25. Please indi- 
cate which computer you have.)

Furthermore, the verify command doesn't 
really live up to its name. It only reads through 
every sector in the file to check for read errors. 
DOS 3.3 contains a serious bug that makes it 
likely that read errors will be missed. When 
DOS writes a sector, it also writes a checksum 
at the end of the sector, which should be the 
sum of all the data in that sector. Unfor- 
tunately, the checksum depends only on the last 
two data bytes. Thus the checksum cannot be 
used to find read errors in the first 340 data 
bytes in a sector. Gross data errors are some- 
times detected in another way (trailing bytes), 
but single-bit errors will often go undetected. 

To summarize, the automatic verify after 
save and bsave provides very little additional 
protection against disk errors. The only true 
protection is to back up your disks. 

Also in the June issue, Stewart Loving-Gib- 
bard asked about using Diversi-DOS with forty- 
track disk drives. The following procedure 
works with standard DOS 3.3 as well as with 
Diversi-DOS: 

POKE 44725,160 
POKE 48894,40 
POKE 46063,40 
(put in blank disk) 
INIT HELLO 

Boot this disk to run forty-track DOS. Init will 
initialize forty-track disks, but you can still read 
and write old thirty-five-track disks correctly. 
Just be careful not to put a forty-track disk in a 
thirty-five-track drive. For backups, you can 
make a forty-track CopyA as follows: 

LOAD COPYA 

70 PRINT CHR$ (4);"BL0AD COPY.OBJ40" 
SAVE COPYA40 
BLOAD COPY.OBJO 
POKE 770,40 
POKE 863,40 

BSAVE COPY.OBJ40,A$2C0,L$10B 

Finally, I wish to thank Softalk readers for 
all the nice letters I have received about Diversi- 
DOS. I worked five years saving people's lives 
(among other duties) as an emergency physi- 
cian, and I received one thank-you letter. After 
five months of saving people's time with Di- 
versi-DOS, I have a whole file full of thank-you 
letters. 

I'll end my letter by congratulating the 
Softalk staff for producing a great magazine 
that keeps getting better. 
Bill Basham, president, Diversified Software 
Research, Rockford, IL 

That's Entertainment 

I found the letter from Peter T. Clark (April 
Open Discussion) to be absurd and ridiculous. 
If he does not like Storytalk Fiction, that's fine 
with me. He doesn't have to read it! 

I happen to like some of the stories. I find 
they help me to get through some of the more 
boring days at work. So what if the stories are, 
in a number of cases, absurd. I find them enter- 
taining and have acquired a number of good 
ideas from them. 

An example is the April Fool story. I got 
several ideas from that on hooking the com- 
puter into the household wiring system and 



overriding my obsessive roommate's habit of 
turning everything off to avoid paying two cents 
here and a penny there on the electric bill. I 
can't stand it, and that story helped me to figure 
out how to solve my problem. (Maybe if I hook 
it up so that if he tries more than three times to 
turn off the lights or air conditioning, it will give 
him a mild shock, say 3(X) volts at about 60 
amps. Just kidding.) 

Don't remove the Storytalk Fiction just be- 
cause one person (or even a hundred) doesn't 
like the fact that two or three pages of the maga- 
zine are too much for him to handle. I find that 
I like to expand my awareness and perceptions, 
even with fiction. 

The first landing of men on the moon was 
prompted by the fiction that Robert Goddard 
read, which led him to build the first crude rock- 
ets. He refused to accept those Buck Rogers 
stories as fiction and went about the task of 
making them into reality. I do not see how fic- 
tion makes Softalk into Playboy. Is Reader's 
Digest another Playboy^. How about all those 
fiction books at the local library? Almost every- 
thing ever accomplished started out with wild 
stories being told about an idea and someone 
turning those wild stories into reality. 
Jeffrey Jones, West Hollywood, CA 

Making Himself Clear 

In the June Open Discussion I saw a letter that 
caught my eye, dealing with my personal views 
and opinions that I've expressed in Open Dis- 
cussion. This letter stated that I should rip out 
the fictional stories in my Softalk. It also 
said that I should not try to take them away 
from those who do enjoy reading them. The au- 
thor of the letter does not understand Open Dis- 
cussion. It is a place to state your personal likes 
and dislikes about the computer world and its 
products. That is why it is called "Open" Dis- 
cussion. 

Just because I do not like a part of Softalk, 
that certainly doesn't mean it should be done 
away with. However, if enough requests are re- 
ceived saying the fictional stories should be re- 
moved from the magazine, they probably will 
be. Also, I never stated that Marketalk Re- 
views should be cut short. I quote: "I have 
noticed the number of reviews declining, as well 
as the length of the reviews. Please try to cram 
in a few more." That means I want to see more, 
not fewer, reviews of Apple software. 
Peter T. Clark, Sacramento, CA 

No Time for Proofs 

I am responding to a few letters appearing in the 
June Open Discussion. I agree with Bear 
Braumoeller's advice to Peter Clark with re- 
spect to the fiction in Softalk: Skip it! It is not 
dull and boring, as Mr. Clark stated. It is inane, 
dull, and boring. 

For Al Goodwin: I can't answer your ques- 
tion, but I ran across a similar problem in one 
of my programs. I had opened three files in a 
loop (10 FOR X= 1 TO 3: F$= "BIN" 
+ STR$(X): PRINT DS;"OPEN";F$: NEXT). 
The MON showed the correct material (selected 
alphabetically) being written, later on, to the

And you're immersed in rich envi

parently the buffer was never sent to the disk. I 
solved the problem by opening a dummy file, 
BinO, starting the loop with zero instead of one. 
I don't know why, but this worked. 

To Stewart Loving-Gibbard: Diversi-DOS is 
superb, but apparently Rana is going to use The 
DOS Enhancer instead. I regret its decision; 
Diversi-DOS should be supported, not only be- 
cause of its excellence, but because of its appeal 
to morality. A note of appreciadon to Dick 
Rettke: I will have to decide whether the de- 
crease in performance is worth it. I wonder if it 
would be too much to ask that DOStalk dis- 
cuss that particular issue in depth? One of the 



best features of Softalk has been its compara- 
five reviews of programs and, occasionally, of 
hardware. A discussion of the problems arising 
out of the use of attractive programs like 
Diversi-DOS would be of supreme help. I would 
especially like Softalk to devote some critical 
comparison time to some of the hardware 
spoolers now available. Especially the Angel, 
Printer Optimizer, and Pipeline.

work (even if I am not there), and the one at 
home is typing out a ninety-page manual for the 
office billing package I wrote, it is obvious that I 
will need copies of the word processor at both 
locations. Since I can't do that without giving 
up other capabilities, perhaps I'll use one word 
processor at home and another at the office. Or 
perhaps I'll make an illegal copy. I don't con- 
sider this piracy, but personal use and con- 
venience. The one-user, one-computer rule, seen 
in some licensing agreements, is not reasonable. 

I don't protect the software I write. It is sent 
out with a request that the customer respect the 
time and effort I have put into it, as well as the 
support I provide after the sale. So far, I know 
that one person has been reselling my work. 
Proving this would be very difficult — I don't 
have the time. 

Jerome B. Blumenthal, Binghamton, NY 
Public Confession 

Although I am only twelve years old, I own an 
Apple and know quite a bit about it. I am the 
only one in the family who uses it. I've got a 
confession to make: I am a software pirate. So 
far, I have pirated about two hundred games, 
utilities, and business programs. I have bought 
only three disks out of sixty-eight, but I have a 
very good reason. I will keep on pirating soft- 
ware for myself and my friends until software 
manufacturers find a good way to sell their soft- 
ware items cheaper. Torture me! Arrest me! 
Beat me! Kill me! You'll never stop me from 
copying software. As one dealer says, when one 
person has a new game, the whole neighbor- 
hood has it. And that's a fact. 
Drew Cheng, Diablo, CA 

Guiltless Gamer 

I am not a software pirate and I do not profit by 
selling cracked software, but I am not above ac- 
cepting free copies of pirated games. Copy pro- 
tection is not worth a company's efforts. It sim- 
ply is not an effective piracy deterrent. Period. 
Those of you who are shaking your finger at 
me can save your tisk, tisk, tisks for someone 
else. I do not feel guilty for robbing any soft- 
ware author of business because I would not 
have purchased the product in the first place. 
Want to know why? Price! You can get a novel 
for $2.50 and a record or tape for less than $10. 
There is no reason a game needs to cost $30 or 
more, unless it's because of copy protection 
costs. All you software companies out there get 
on the ball and follow Penguin's lead. 

To William J. Evans (July Open Dis- 
cussion): I'll tell you why the word kludge is 
spelled with a "d" and pronounced like "huge" 
if you'll tell me why the two words "good food" 
are pronounced the way they are. 
David Belkin, Houston, TX 

One Man's Diagnosis 

This letter is an open reply to Bill Jones's letter 
in the June Open Discussion. 

Mister, you don't seem to realize it, but 
you're just a thief. Part of your rationale for 
stealing software, the fact that you can't afford 
it, is simply fiabbergasting. It's difficult to

convey adequately how warped that kind of 
thought process is. I want a Ferrari 308; how- 
ever, 1 can't afford it. With your line of think- 
ing, it would be a perfectly rational act there- 
fore to steal it. Incredible! 

You also say that you and your fellow 
criminals steal programs that "aren't worth the 
disks they come on." That statement alone 
speaks volumes about the mentality of soft- 
ware thieves. That's known as kleptomania: the 
irresistible urge to steal, without regard for per- 
sonal needs. It doesn't make any difference how 
highly you rate your intellectual skills in subse- 
quently manipulating your stolen goods. You 
intimate that you occasionally sell software you 
write yourself Get serious. Nobody needs the 
kind of program that someone like you would 
produce. Get yourself some help. 
Rudy J. Stricklan, Mesa, AZ 

Terms of the Social Contract 

I believe that programmers should be rewarded 
for their time and ingenuity. An excellent pro- 
gram deserves all the support its audience can 
provide. In the history of humankind, the big- 
gest obstacles to growth and creativity have 
been the pillage of the nonproducer (barbarian, 
pirate, and so forth) and the barriers needed to 
prevent it. 

I wish to reply to Daniel Shine's "frumple" 
in the July Open Discussion. I don't believe 
semantics is a decisive factor. Piracy will be 
allowed to continue until the economic irrita- 
tion it creates forces the productive members of 
society to find adequate protection. To the ex- 
tent that these protections are a burden to all 
users, we are all paying for the rip-offs of the 
unethical. 

On a longer time scale, the social contract 
("Moral codes and ethical distinctions") is the 
only framework within which our species can 
continue to exist. Cultures thrive in direct pro- 
portion to the degree to which they honor the 
principles of justice and equity. Cultures that 
allow the nonproductive to operate (or worse 
yet, dominate) inevitably fail. 

Finally, the need for moral codes — for de- 
fined and agreed-upon rules for dealing with 
each other — increases with the density of the 
population. Those who choose to ignore the 
social contract are often excluded from it, ostra- 
cized, and (for offenses like murder, not soft- 
ware piracy) sometimes eliminated. Doing 
"what seems right at a given time" is a flabby 
use of situational ethics, the lowest common 
denominator of human existence. The value we 
give to ourselves, our culture, and its future is 
reflected in our contributions to the common 
good and our respect for the efforts of others. I 
vote against piracy.

Advice from a Pro 

To Ira Strum: I felt that I must write and tell 
you how inspiring your letter in the July Open 
Discussion was. You're a kid after my own 
heart! Like you said, "Everyone copies some- 
thing in their lifetime for their own use." What I 
don't understand is why you stick with penny- 



ante stuff like software. Listen, you're never go- 
ing to get anywhere that way! 

Follow my advice, kid, and move to some 
bigger-ticket item like "copying" cars. That's 
what I did. I, like many other people, "copied" 
any car I could get my hands on. In fact, I own 
only one car that I bought from a store. Every- 
body I know "copies" cars. 

Perhaps I wouldn't "copy" so much if the 
price of a car weren't so high. I'm twenty-four 
years old and I make only $2,500 a month. After 
taxes, rent, utilities, food, and so on, it might 
take me months to save up enough money to 
get a decent car. If I "copy" cars, I can get up to 
fifteen cars without paying a cent in one month! 
(The only problem is finding parking spaces for 
them.) 



Keep up the good work, kid. Maybe some- 
day you'll really be a pro, like mc.

View from the Lighthouse 

David Chandler (June Open Discussion) be- 
lieves that the Applesoft tutorial that comes 
with the Apple is bad because it is obsolete. Of 
course I disagree, as anyone must who had to 
teach himself Applesoft. What a marvelous way 
to learn the mysteries of the Apple! Compare it 
to the Radio Shack book I tried to decipher, or 
to the CP/M handbook. It's a lighthouse in a 
stormy sea of mystery indeed. 

Even now, with my Apple He, I still have 
my Panasonic tape recorder hooked up ready to

WHERE IS IT? 

Wherever it is, we want it. Maybe, just maybe, we're 
searching for your program, but we'll never find it 
unless you call us. 

It has to be good, though. Because we're the 
Software Guild'" an organization devoted to finding 
the very best microcomputer programs for packaging 
and distribution under the Softsmith'" label. Hundreds 
of titles have already been licensed to the Softsmith 
library. But they're only the beginning. Our goal is to 
have the best program in major categories on every 



popular machine. Of course, we can't do it without you. 

If you're a program author or publisher. The 
Software Guild offers some distinct professional and 
monetary advantages. 

First, you devote your time to what you do best: 
programming. You can leave the manufacturing, 
packaging, documentation, distribution and customer 
service to us. 

Second, our revolutionary retail merchandising 
system will put your program before the public through 
the normal computer and software stores, plus record 
outlets, department stores, book shops, and more 
places where software has never before been available. 



Third, is royalties. Wider distribution means more 
substantial royalties. And, your Software Guild 
royalties start to accrue when the dealer makes his pur- 
chase in quantity, so you aren't left waiting while 
money trickles in. 

Fourth is flexibility. We do not insist on the 
exclusive rights to your program. You can deal with 
other publishers and distributors, or market your pro- 
gram yourself, while it is in Softsmith distribution. 

We know you're out there, working and dream- 
ing, and we want to help make your dream come true. 
Our full staff of professional evaluators are waiting to 
review your best-seller. 



So call us, wherever you are.

Not use color graphics? I'm sure there are 
thousands of Apple owners out there just smil- 
ing at that. Why, you may as well have a Timex 
as an Apple without color. 

Mr. Chandler should be pleased to know 
that the folks at Apple apparently agree with 
him and not with me. My new Apple He came 
without the tape recorder cable, without the 
Applesoft tutorial, and, to do Mr. Chandler one 
better, without an instruction manual at all!

Paul Raymer, Las Vegas, NV 

Another Point of View 

I disagree with David Chandler's comments in 
the June Open Discussion about the MX-80 
printer manual. 

I agree that it is a bit "folksy" in places, but 
if you compare it to the documentation for 
other printers it rates very high. Take, for

instance, the Apple printer, which is amazingly 
similar to the Prowriter and several other 
printers. What you get is a general operation 
manual and a reference card that outlines all the 
escape sequences, but you have to have some 
programming experience and/or a natural gift 
for understanding computer documentation to 
figure it out. 

The MX-80 manual, contrary to Mr. Chan- 
dler's claims, does not wait until page 87 to 
explain that the sample programs work only on 
a TRS-80. It clearly states this before the very 
first sample program, and it should be obvious 
to anyone familiar with Applesoft that Iprint is 
not a valid command. Furthermore, at the be- 
ginning of most sample programs it adds the 
line: 

9 PR#1 (Apple) 

As to his comment on the author's avoid- 
ance of factual content in the manual, I can say 
only that 1 can't find more than ten pages with- 
out factual content. In addition, the author in- 
cludes a summary of commands at the end of 
each secfion that you can refer to when reading 
the sample programs. 

In general I have found the MX-80 very 
easy to use. Unfortunately, I traded it in for an 
Apple printer thinking that the extra speed 
would make up for its other drawbacks. So far, 
the MX-80 seems to me to be the best bet for a 
beginning computer user who wants to exploit 
the full potential of his printer. 
Bret Mulvey, Woodinville, WA 

Fellow Conscriptee Speaks 

Having been inspired by David Chandler's re- 
marks in the June issue, I want to share my ex- 
perience with software. What got me started 
was his observafions about Home Accountant 
by Continental. Using it is "like being con- 
scripted into the Albanian army," says 
Chandler. 

The program is so awkward that it has com- 
pletely changed my financial record-keeping 
habits. With the old ball-point and calculator 
way, I used to balance my checkbooks at the 
end of each month. Not anymore. Home Ac- 
countant will not let you go back and make an 
entry in a previous month once you have started 
a new month. Result: I now wait until June 
before closing out April just in case an item 
comes along for May that has not been entered. 
You wouldn't believe some of the other cra- 
ziness it puts you through. 

I am positive that the good notices for 
Home Accountant are from reviewers who 
looked at the manual and read the advertising 
but did not bother to give it a try. 

Now on to a couple of well-earned bou- 
quets. I have had an Apple for eighteen months 
(I'm no expert), and I bought my first Beagle 
Bros program, Apple Mechanic, on impulse in a 
software store. I currently have about six more 
Beagle Bros programs. Each one is a gem. Talk 
about having respect for the user! They are 
witty and instructive, and they are mind 
stretchers. Also, I would buy anything put out 
by Sierra On-Line on the strength of Screen 



Writer II. It's an incredible piece of software. 
Herb Abelson, Princeton, NJ 

Tackling the Tackier 

In response to Nancy Stanger (May Open Dis- j 
cussion), there is a very good recipe program I 
written by Jim Ganz called Recipe File. It ap- | 
peared in the February 1983 issue of] 
Call —A.P.P.L.E., page 43. This same program ' 
has also appeared on Softdisk, the monthly disk 
magazine. i 

I have a plea for anyone who knows about 
the Tymac Tackier printer interface card. I have 
one connected to a Gemini- 10 printer, and I 
have yet to figure out how to do hi-res screen 
dumps like the manual says it can do. I would 
appreciate any information.

Go Forth 

I have just finished reading a very good book 
titled Starting Forth by Leo Brodie. If you 
want to learn Forth (on any computer), I 
recommend it. I'm so impressed with Forth that 
I'm planning to buy a Forth interpreter for my 
Apple. Now, can anybody tell me where to get a 
good but inexpensive Forth? I haven't seen any 
reviewed. Any suggestions?

Playing a Shell Game with the Thick-Skinned 

I am looking for a program to track sales calls 
for a department of a bank with five salespeo-

is in the category of an elephant squashing a 
walnut. Plus, the pachyderm won't fit through

Something To Discuss 

I am writing with a couple of suggestions I 
think might increase contact between Softalk j 
readers through Open Discussion. I 
I feel it would be to the readers' advantage 1 
to print the actual addresses of the people who ! 
write in asking for answers to questions. Most 
magazines that have a readers' column print a 
response to letters sent in, and also give sugges- | 
tions to solve problems that the readers may 
have encountered. 1 feel it would increase the ef- 
fectiveness of Open Discussion. 
Randy Cain, Burwell, NE 

Open Discussion is intended to be a forum in 
which Softalk readers can exchange ideas and 
helpful suggestions with other readers. Out of re- 
spect for the rights of those subscribers who would 
not appreciate having their addresses printed pub- 
licly, it is Softalk'.? policy not to print them at the 
end of letters. Besides, it's more fun when many 
people can share in the dialogue — each con- 
tributing a unique point of view. We will gladly 
forward any correspondence to fellow readers: 
just include a stamped envelope with your letter 
and send it to Open Discussion. 

If you have a baffling problem or question 
that requires the explanation of an expert, direct 
it to If Then Maybe, a new Softalk department 
beginning in this issue. 



If you guessed that a Practical Peripherals Micro- 
buffer™ printer buffer saves time, you're right. For 
the way it works, this inexpensive product is the 
most practical addition to your microcomputer sys- 
tem ever. 

With Microbuffer, you don't have to wait for 
your printer to finish before you resume using your 
computer. Data is received and stored at fast speeds, 
then released from Microbuffer's memory to your 
printer. This is called buffering. The more you 
print, the more productive it makes your workflow. 

Depending on the version of Microbuffer, 
these buffering capacities range from a useful 8K of 
random access memory — big enough for 8,000 
characters of storage — up to a very large 256K— 
enough for 256,000 characters of storage. 

Practical Peripherals makes stand-alone 
Microbuffers for any computer and printer combi- 



nation, including add-on units especially for Apple 
II computer and/or Epson printers. Elach has differ- 
ent features like graphics dumps an(] text format- 
ting besides its buffering capabilities. You can 
choose one that's just right for your syst(.*n'i. 

Best of all, they're built U) last and work 
exactly like they're supposed U). 

If you're still guessing whether you can afford 
to have one, talk with any computer dealer. That's 
the best way to find out how practical a Practical 
Peripherals Microbuffer is.

From time to time one of 
the fourteen Apple II 
disk drives in my school's computer lab refuses 
to boot, giving the usual series of protesting 
clacks and clatters and finally yielding an I/O 
error. Why, then (and this is a fairly consistent 
solution), does it finally agree to boot only after 
I've taken it off the top of the computer and 
placed it on the table beside? I don't think it's 
the cables because they are well secured to the 
back of the computer. It seems to happen more 
frequently with four or five machines in par- 
ticular but probably could happen to any of 
them. G)uld it be electromagnefic in nature? I 
would like to hear your diagnosis. Gary M. Lee,

Annoyingly, Roger Wagner suggests using a

much typing of numbers! Why couldn't one use

to see an article on how this could be imple- 
mented. Alan Kaufman, West Newton, MA

In my picture above 
the DOStalk column, 
there's a diaper in my hands — symbolic of my ex- 
pertise in softwear. What you have sounds like a 
hardware problem. (Have you noticed how that 
line is beginning to have the same ring as "Your 
check is in the mail"?) 

I remanber reading a letter in a magazine 
from someone who had a problem similar to 
yours. After several faulty diagnoses, the prob- 
lem was traced to interference from the display 
screen. The problem was solved by inserting a 
metal shield somewhere inside the sensitive 
drive. I did take one of my drives apart once; I 
remember that it had a metal shield inside. You 
might compare the inside of your faulty drive 
with one of your good ones to see if the shield is 
there. Tom Weishaar, Overland Park, KS 

I recently purchased a 
used Videx Videoterm 
from a friend. The eighty-column display 
worked fine on his monitor but not on the 
Monitor III. Instead of getting the supposed 
eighty columns, 1 get only seventy, with the 
other ten spilling off the screen. If there's any 
way of getting those lost columns, I'd sure like 
to know how. Stanley Ho, Briarwood, NY 




Unfortunately, the char- 
acter set that the Ap- 
ple II Plus uses is not addressable by the mi- 
croprocessor. The chip that generates the font is 
on the very front row of the motherboard, di- 
rectly underneath the keyboard. This is the chip 
that you would replace if you were to install a 
lower-case adapter in the II Plus. The ROM, 
which contains the built-in programs that the 
microprocessor can read, is a row of six chips 
about six inches from the back of the mother- 
board. In the Apple He, the configuration is dif- 
ferent but the result is the same. There is no 
character set in memory that the Apple, op- 
erating in Basic or machine language, can read. 
David Durkee, Burbank, CA 



Looking through com- 
puter magazines late- 
ly I've seen advertisements for punches to turn 
single-sided disks into double-sided disks. I have 
spoken with several computer-repair persons 
about this practice. They claim that the other 
side of a single-sided disk is not polished, and 
that it damages the head on your disk drive. If 
this is true, it should be made public knowledge 
so that disk heads are not damaged. 

Can anyone please comment on the safety 
of this practice and whether the emulsion on the 
other side is adequate for storage. Jeffrey S.

backs. My recommendation is to double (flip- 
pie) only the disks you're going to keep in your 
library. For the working disks that may have 
high value or be used daily, use only one side. 

Using the back side of a disk will have no ef- 
fect on the head wear. As for the polishing, all 
disks are treated on both front and back sides. 
The head load button in the drive should be 
changed periodically, usually every six months 
to a year. The head load button collects a lot of 
particles and can scratch the back side of the 
disk. If you are in a dirty environment, the 
monthly use of a head cleaning kit is recom- 
mended, or you can use a head cleaner and a cot- 
ton swab. Head cleaners do nothing for the 
head load button, however. Also, head cleaners 
can dissolve the glue holding the head load but- 
ton in place, so don't get the cleaner on this but- 
ton. A new head load button can be obtained at 
your Apple dealer; just ask for part number 
815-0064. Roy Hicks. Buellton. CA 

Can anyone tell me what 
file types R and S are? 
Also, what is the significance of the number 
found at location 2049 (decimal) after an Ap- 
plesoft program is loaded? The January DOS- 
talk touched on this location as a means of 
making programs unlistable, but I am curious 
about the significance of the value. 

Is there any documentation about how an 
Applesoft program is stored in memory, and 
where can I get it? I am aware of the tokens for 
commands, but I'd like more information. Ed 
Melo, Piscataway. NJ 




THiH 



Unless the user changes 
the start of program 
pointers, an Applesoft program will always be- 
gin at location 2048 ($800 hex). Location 2049 is 
part of the pointer (the low byte) to the second 
line of the program. The table illustrates mem- 
ory usage for this simple Applesoft program: 

10 PRINT A 
100 END 

Line 100 appears starting at hex location $808. 
The numbers at locations 2049 and 2050 
"point" to this location. If you want to have 
fun with a friend, load a program and type 



poke 2049.1. Then list it. 

For more details on Applesoft memory 
usage, the best reference I have seen \s All About 
Applesoft, published by Apple Pugetsound Pro- 
gram Library Exchange (21246 Sixty -eighth 
Avenue South, Kent, WA 98032). Your local 
dealer should be able to order it if he doesn't 
carry it already. You cannot order it directly 
from A.P.P.L.E. unless you are a member or a 
dealer. The book also contains a large number 
of utility programs, information about amper- 
sand functions, hi-res graphics, revectoring re- 
set, and a variety of other resource material 
about Applesoft useful to novices and experts 
alike. 

There are provisions in DOS for eight dif- 
ferent file types. The familiar ones are B, A, I, 
and T. These stand for binary, Applesoft, Inte- 
ger Basic, and text files respectively, and they 
are the only file types that you can ever get us- 
ing normal DOS commands. If you are more 
adventurous you can use a disk access utility 
program to modify directory entries directly 
and produce the other four file types. To do this 
you will need to modify the third byte of any di- 
rectory entry (track 17, sector 15, byte 13, for in- 
stance). If this sounds foreign to you, read the 
manuals that come with the disk access utili- 
ties, or study pages 127-134 of your DOS 
manual. 

Changing the file type byte allows you to 
produce four new file types: B, A, R, and S. The 
new B type will not bload. The Lisa assembler 
uses this file type to indicate its file types and to 
prevent them from being bloaded outside of the 
program. I don't know of anyone who uses the 
other A type. The R stands for relocatable file 
and is used by the DOS Tool Kit to indicate re- 
locatable machine language files. The S type 
was put in for some future expansion use that 
Apple never implemented. As far as I know, it 
has no valid use. A number of software pub- 
lishers set up title files that simply print the 
name of the disk and copyright information in 
the catalog. Since these directory entries do not 
actually have any program associated with 
them, the file type may be changed to S to pre- 
vent anyone from loading, bloading, or execing 
them. At this time, they have no other use.

Accounting 
For Lisa and 
HicRiture 

Bv DAVID wmm 

When the Apple II first appeared in 1977, Apple cofounder Steve' 
Jobs made an analogy between the automobile and the personal com-; 
puter. He predicted that the personal computer would be put to many ^ 
uses as yet unimagjned— just as cars have, since their introduction, been ' 
put to many uses that turn-of-the-century automobile makers couldn't ^ 
have foreseen. ; 

Practically every day, Jobs's forecast is proven accurate. Who could ' 
have imagined seven years ago that the Apple would be used for con- ' 
trolling the environment of a home, creating music, designing every- ; 
thing from ultralights to solar-heated houses, and helping the handi- ^ 
capped? Who could have imagined that the Apple would play an integral i 
part in the running of tens of thousands of small businesses in this : 
country and around the world? ' 

When they first appeared, automobiles were by themselves a promis- i 
ing technology, but without good roads they couldn't have competed ' 
with horses or even a physically fit individual. Software is to computers i 
what roads are to cars. The usefulness of the Apple II, Apple III, and'i 
now the Lisa depends on smooth, well-designed routes that lead to 
desired goals. 

Paving the Way. Apple Computer has attracted some of the most t 
innovative and expert road builders in the computer world. Some of these i 
master paviors work directly for Apple, but by far the majority are inde- j 
pendent, strong-spirited individuals or groups that have adopted the"! 
Apple as the informational tool of today and tomorrow. Apple has been 
lucky and so have the rest of us, the users. '] 

BPI Systems of Austin, Texas, is one of these master paviors. By last 1 
count, upward of one hundred thousand microcomputer systems are;- 
equipped with one or more of BPI's accounting software packages. BPI , 
is a remarkable success story that begins, like so many others, with a ] 
small, tight-knit group of entrepreneurs and their recognition that a per- ; 

sonal computer needs a good road. 1

^Ol:TAI 1/ 



SEPTEMBER 1983 




BPI's Pascal systems group manager, David Powers, runs through a demo 
of the company's new accounting software for the Lisa. 

John Moss, chairman of the board at BPI, is semiretired nowadays, 
not taking part in the day-to-day activities of running the company. An 
accountant by trade. Moss spent thirty years of his life owning and 
operating small businesses. It was his energy and business instincts that 
got BPI started in the late seventies and steered the company onto its 
continuing course of success. 

In 1977, Moss was overseeing a franchise chain of retail food stores 
in Texas when he realized that an accounting system using microcom- 
puters could improve the operation. The general accounting for Moss's 
operation was sent to an outside accounting firm that used mainframes. 

The time required to get the information to and from the accounting 
firm caused some of the smaller stores in Moss's chain to be behind the 
times. They couldn't react very fast to the changing market scene. Moss, 
who had seen Radio Shack's TRS-80 Model I, realized that microcom- 
puters could offer the individual accountant a way to manipulate finan- 
cial data quickly and easily. He envisioned a system similar to, but scaled 
down from, what the big accounting firms used. 

"John is not a programmer," says Randy Ferguson, BPI's president. 
"But he's a visionary who saw the potential of the microcomputer to 
help with these aspects of running a small business." 

General DeBower. In 1978, Moss met Ken DeBower, a data process- 
ing professional with nearly eighteen years' experience. Moss hired 
DeBower to write a general ledger program for use in his retail food store 
chain. Working weekends, DeBower wrote the general ledger program 
on the Apple II; and, other than one major revision, the program has re- 
mained the same through the years and is used by tens of thousands of 
businesses. 

Woe to the entrepreneur who misses an opportunity. Moss showed 
the general ledger program to a computer store dealer in Dallas and 
struck up a deal wherein he and DeBower would deliver five hundred 
systems over the course of five months. Moss wrote the user manual for 
the product and the program became very popular with those who ran 
across it in those early days. 

At the same time that Moss and DeBower were starting their modest 
accounting software business. Randy Ferguson, a native Texan, was 
starting a similar scheme. 

Ferguson, who was vice president of operations at the Austin Na- 
tional Bank, was trying to find an accounts-receivable system for his twin 
brother's small business. Ferguson had spent five years in the data 
processing department at the Austin National Bank working in sales. 



He'd also done a smaU amount of programming on Wang minicomputers. 

Early in 1979, Ferguson wrote an accounts-receivable program for 
his brother on the Apple 1 1 and was so impressed with the outcome that 
he decided to start selling it. 

As fate would have it, Ferguson and Moss met in a Waco computer 
store when Ferguson went searching on his brother's behalf for a gen- 
eral ledger program. Ferguson found the program and his future busi- 
ness partners. 

In the summer of 1979, Moss, DeBower, and Ferguson each put up a 
thousand dollars and formed BPI Systems. The company's initials stand 
for business, professional, and industrial, which are the three main 
markets the trio decided to go after. The first general ledger programs 
started shipping in July 1979 and BPI was off and running. 

Good News Travels Fast. From the start, the company seemed des- 
tined for success. Within half a year of having formed BPI, DeBower and 
Ferguson quit their regular jobs to devote all their time and energy to the 
company. Their first two products were well received and, despite the 
lack of firm distribution networks, the good word about BPI's products 
spread — it spread all the way to the heights of Mount Olympus. 

Both Commodore and Atari were impressed with BPI's accounting 
software and struck up mass purchase deals in 1980. In those early days, 
BPI hit upon a good scheme that circumvented the dearth of distribu- 
tors — sell programs en masse to computer manufacturers and let them 
handle the distribution. By 1980, small business applications and micro- 
computers seemed the perfect marriage. The personal computer manu- 
facturers saw a way to sell more machines, and a remarkable number 
came knocking on BPI's door. 

By midyear BPI was shipping three to four hundred packages a 
month. The company was run entirely by Moss, DeBower, Ferguson, 
and Moss's wife Margaret. In November of that year, the company hired 
its first salaried employee. 

The biggest milestone in the company's history came when Apple 
Computer inquired about distributing BPI's accounting software for the 
Apple II. A deal was struck in short order and BPI started shipping thou- 
sands of products a month. 

The mutually beneficial relationship between Apple and BPI relies on 
the particular strengths of the two companies. BPI produces the prod- 
ucts, including packaging and documentation, and provides support, 
while Apple markets and distributes them. It's a relationship that both 
corporate entities have been pleased with and hope will continue for 
some time. 

BPI and Apple are of like mind. Recent estimates put the penetra- 
tion of microcomputers into the potential small business market at 5 per- 
cent. And the size of the small business market is enormous. Ferguson 
calls it "the Fortune fourteen million." Any serious attempt to capture a 
large part of that market cannot be a half effort. Joining forces gives both 
parties a fighting chance and is often the most efficient use of available 
resources. 

The OEM Connection. Until this year, BPI operated for the most 
part like an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) supplier, shipping 
its prepacked accounting software to computer manufacturers, who mar- 
keted and distributed it. The level of expertise — in documentation, sup- 
port, packaging, and programming — demanded of BPI is no less than 
that demanded of a more maverick operation, which must attract dis- 
tributors and dealers by the quality of the product and not by the fact 
that an Apple Computer or an IBM has put its name on it. 

Many factors go into the making of a successful software publishing 
firm like BPI. One vital factor is skilled, creative people. Once the busi- 
ness began to take off BPI was fortunate enough to attract a number of 
talented individuals. 

Ann Oppenlander, BPI's vice president of customer support and 
documentation, joined the company in January 1981. Oppenlander, who 
has a Ph.D. in English, brought to the firm considerable experience in 
documentation writing. Prior to joining BPI she'd worked at NCR, pro- 
gramming business applications on DEC mainframes, and had spent two 
years as manager of Texas Instruments's publications department. 

When she saw BPI's products, Oppenlander was impressed and ac- 
cepted Moss's offer to join the young company. She started on the tele- 
phone, answering customer-support calls and learning the "audience," 
which she says was quite different from what she was used to at TI.

"At Texas Instruments, we were writing manuals for programmers. 
Here was a challenge to make them understandable to everyday 
people." 

Both Ferguson and Oppenlander are convinced that a clear, concise, 
understandable manual is a critical aspect of putting out a successful 
software product for the personal computer market. "In this industry," 
says Ferguson, "it's a case of data processing products being produced 
by data processing people for non-data processing users." 

By having the dual responsibility of producing the manuals and over- 
seeing the customer-service area, Oppenlander knows how users are re- 
sponding to BPFs products on a daily basis. The company regularly re- 
ceives between five thousand and six thousand calls a month, and a 
careful tally is kept on the nature of the calls. 

Master of Operations. BPI's vice president of operations, Larry 
Pick el, joined the company early in 1981. He spent nine years with the 
Austin National Bank in a number of diverse positions, including opera- 
tions and data processing. For a while, he worked with Ferguson at the 
bank, and that previous association helped land him the job at BPI. 

Pickel refers to his basic responsibilities as making sure "the ox gets 
out of the ditch." He oversees the product management and administra- 
tion of BPI. He has two adept managers working under him, one in 
charge of production and one in charge of administration. 

Pickel, like so many in the microcomputer software industry, left a 
good, solid job for the uncertainty (and excitement) of software publish- 
ing and is glad he did. 

"Where Fm going I can't tell you," he says. "But it took something to 
make me leave an officer's chair at the bank to come here. All of us — 
Ken, Randy, Ann — are not here just to make a quick profit. We're here 
for the long haul." 

Gerald I. Greifer is BPI's comptroller and assistant secretary. A CPA 
by profession, Greifer comes from the world of New York City high fi- 
nance, where he was with Peat, Marwick, and Mitchell, the largest ac- 
counting firm in the world. 

In the spring of 1981, Greifer helped Moss and Ferguson on BPI's 
Payroll package update as a private consultant. With his knowledge and 
experience, Greifer has been invaluable to the development of BPI's 
products. He joined BPI full-time in November 1981. 

Greifer believes that BPI's potential for growth is "unlimited, if we 
do the right things. This is a small company by New York standards, but 
it's not disorganized. They say that large companies have meetings too 
often and that small companies don't meet often enough. Large com- 
panies can get very political in their structure. BPI is the perfect world 
for me." 

Accounting Triumvirate. The three top execs that hold the reins at 
BPI, now that Moss is not in the office on a day-to-day basis, are Fer- 
guson, DeBower, and Thomas Meadows. 

DeBower attended the University of Nebraska and discovered com- 
puters in the early sixties. He's worked as a programmer at Texas Instru- 
ments and Radian Corporation, an environmental and energy con- 
sulting firm. The only bonus he ever got at Radian he spent one after- 
noon on an Apple II. He saw the computer as his ticket to greater things. 

As BPI's executive vice president, DeBower spends a lot of time 
helping to move the company's programs over to other microcomputers. 
He sees computer hardware getUng smaller and faster in the future. 
"Computers are still almost a toy, kind of backward," he explains. "The 
microcomputer industry is heading toward machines with minicom- 
puterlike performance and capabilities for multiple users." 

BPI's senior vice president and secretary, Thomas Meadows, came 
from IBM, where he held various marketing and management posi- 
tions. For a while after that, he had his own consulting firm. A little over 
a year ago, he came to BPI. 

Meadows is a confident and likable marketer who spends a lot of his 
time on the road, spreading the word about BPI's products. His job is of 
paramount importance because the basic strategy at BPI is changing. 

Last year, the company was totally an OEM supplier, but this year 
it's trying something new. Ferguson says the firm is moving into selected 
vertical markets on its own and that these kinds of efforts will account 
for 40 percent of the company's products in 1983. 

Programs like Church Management, Speed Reading, Professional 
Time Accounting, and now BPI's accounting software for the Lisa are 



just some of the products that the company will market and adverfise on 
its own. 

The Third GAP. BPI's and Apple's relationship has continued with 
the Apple lie and the Apple III. BPI's General Accounting Package for 
the Apple III is currently going into full distribution. The experience BPI 
has accumulated while creating accounting software for the Apple II 
family of computers over the years is reflected in the Apple III package. 

Last year, in September, Apple approached BPI about producing ac- 
counfing software for the Lisa. Apple shipped a Lisa to BPI in the first 
week of October and sent a couple more in the early part of this year. 
Under the guidance of Pascal systems group manager David Powers and 
programmer Andy Chisholm, the project has gone smoothly and ma- 
tured quickly. BPI's accounting software is the first from an independ- 
ent publisher to take advantage of the Lisa's advanced features. 

The Lisa project came at a good time because BPI was well into 
creating the Pascal code for the General Accounting Package for the 
Apple III. Doing so was simply a matter of moving the application code 
from the III to the Lisa and then building a software shell that capi- 
talizes on Lisa's functions. 

BPI has three accounting programs that run on the Lisa: General Ac- 
counting Reports, Accounts Receivable Reports, and A ccounts Payable Re- 
ports. After booting the system, you put in one of BPI's application disks 
(or "twiggies," as Powers likes to call the Lisa's new style of high-den- 
sity, dual-window disks). The software takes you right to what is called 
the environment window, a menu that allows you to use Lisa's Desktop 
Manager, the ProFile hard disk, or the BPI system. 

The program shell is similar to Lisa's office environment. It uses 
hierarchical menus and icons for parficular functions, all controllable by 
the Lisa's mouse/pointer. Except when you're entering the basic finan- 
cial data, which is done by using Lisa's ten-key numeric keypad, the 
mouse is all you need to work with the system. 

Each of BPI's programs for the Lisa includes the Disk Document 
Manager, which permits you to delete or preserve documents on disks 
and perform a variety of other related data management tasks. Within 
the Disk Document Manager is the query feature, which allows you to 
look at a particular listing or find a stored document without terminat- 
ing the primary function in process. 

BPI's Lisa packages should be appearing in a matter of months, 
released by BPI but not distributed by Apple. A payroll package for the 
Lisa is also in the works. 

Streets of Financial Fire. In June 1982, BPI made a public stock 
offering, and a little over a month ago the company had its first annual 
stockholders meeting. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 1983, BPI 
reported total revenues of a little more than $6 million and net earnings 
of $1 .5 million. Three years earlier, those figures were seventy thousand 
dollars and twenty-five hundred dollars respectively. 

The company has grown in three years from a half dozen or so 
employees to around one hundred twenty. BPI occupies several build- 
ings within a mile of each other off Guadalupe, one of Austin's main 
drags, just up the street from the University of Texas. BPI has purchased 
land and is constructing its own building, which the company hopes to 
occupy by the end of 1984. 

Austin, as it turns out, is a good location for a high-tech company. 
The University of Texas regularly turns out a large crop of bright and 
eager graduates in computer science and engineering. There are also 
several large computer firms in the area, such as Texas Instruments and 
Intel. Most recently, the Miaoelectronics and Computer Technology 
Corporation, a research corporation founded by a consortium of Amer- 
ican computer firms, moved into the area. 

BPI serves nine main clients as an OEM supplier. The nine are 
Apple, Atari, Commodore, DEC, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, NEC, Sanyo, 
and Texas Instruments. 

"We view ourselves as an extension of the hardware manufacturers' 
organizations," says Meadows. "Each of the nine is different. Yet we have 
the ability to adapt and do things their way." 

With new directions, a solid working relationship with most of the 
big-name microcomputer manufacturers, and a competent, professional 
stafi', BPI is a vital element in the world of financial software. Ferguson 
believes the company has brought together three professions — journal- 
ism, accounting, and programming — into a triple-threat force.

One company has sold more printers 
to this planet than anybody. 

Epson. 



By now, that shouldn't come as any surprise. 
After all, we invented digital printers for the 1964 
Tokyo Olympics. 

Since then, we've built more print mecha- 
nisms than the rest of the world combined. 
Including the world's smallest printers, the 
world's most reliable printers and the world's 
first disposable print head. 

And today we are proud — but not surprised 
— to say that the world's best selling printers 
for small computers 
have the Epson name 
right on the front. 

But the really 
amazing fact about 
Epson printers is this: 
they don't cost any 
more than other 
printers. In fact, they

frequently cost less. 

Here's how we got to be the world's best- 
selling printers: by building a quality product, by 
pricing it fairly and by standing behind it. That's 
the way we've done business for almost 20 years. 

Only one printer can claim to be "number one." 
And measured by popular acceptance, by techno- 
logical innovation, by honest-to-goodness value, 
not to mention sheer weight of numbers, that

The Schodhouse Apple 

by Jock Root 




The computer revolution is making life difficult for teachers. It used 
to be that a teacher could answer most of a student's questions, even out- 
side of the classroom, simply because the teacher was older and there- 
fore more experienced than the student. But microcomputers have dis- 
rupted that pattern — they're coming on so fast that the teachers can 
hardly stay ahead of the students. 

This month's column is dedicated to those teachers. We're going to 
discuss resources; if your school has just acquired a new Apple and peo- 
ple are asking you what your department plans to do with it and what 
software you'll need, then this column is for you. We can't answer those 
questions for you, but we can show you where to find some answers. 

Several kinds of resources are available. We will consider four vari- 
eties — professional organizations, computer education centers, maga- 
zines, and software directories. These categories overlap a good deal. 
Most of the professional groups publish journals, and some of them 
maintain computer centers or publish software directories. 

Let's start with the magazines. One of the fastest and most pleasant 
ways to acquire literacy in any field is to read the magazines of that field; 
and, in the case of magazines about computers for teachers, there's a spe- 
cial advantage. Magazines by teachers for teachers, which most of these 
are, teach you more than most other magazines could. 

The Computing Teacher. One of the oldest and best magazines for 
teachers is the journal of the International Council for Computers in 
Education (ICCE), The Computing Teacher. It's a big one — sixty to 
eighty pages, mostly editorial — and it's all fascinating. Consider, for 
example, the August 1983 issue. 

A college English teacher, Helen J. Schwartz, writes about a CAI 
program she developed to introduce her students to literary analysis. She 
has combined the patient, nit-picking thoroughness of the computer with 
the human cleverness of the students themselves to create the Seeing-Eye 
Elephant Network, SEEN for short. 

The Seeing-Eye part of the program is an interactive tutorial on get- 
ting your thoughts together about a story idea or a character. It prompts 
students to create hypotheses about characters in stories they've read and 
to support their hypotheses with evidence from the stories. They're 
prompted to put these thoughts in the form of "notices," which are re- 
membered by the Elephant part of the program. 

The notices are also posted (under pen names) in the network, which 
makes them available to be read by the other students. The other stu- 
dents can then make comments (also under pen names), which the au- 
thors of the notices can read. Thus students can get thoughtful and con- 
sidered feedback from their peers — which may be more effective than 
what they get from the teacher, since it's in their own language. 

Incidentally, this program is a clear demonstration that a computer 
in the classroom is not necessarily an impersonal influence. 

The SEEN program is available, at cost, from Helen Schwartz, Eng- 
lish Department, Oakland University, Rochester, MI 48063. The Apple 
II Plus version, which requires 48K, one or two disk drives, and CP/M, 
costs $5 for a listing of the code or $10 for a disk. Both versions include 
instructions for user and instructor. 

Another August article, by Kenneth A. Ryba and James W. Chap- 
man, makes the point that computers can actually have a "humanizing" 
effect on instruction, at least in the sense of giving the student more con- 
trol over the instructional process. This can be very important to some 
students, particularly those whose feelings of internal control are weak. 

A strong feeling of internal control corresponds roughly to "I am 
running my own life," while a feeling of external control corresponds to, 
"They are doing this to me, and I can't help it." Students who do poorly 
in school consistently may come to accept that as a permanent pattern 



that they're helpless to change. They may begin to think "Why bother to 
try?" And, of course, if they stop trying, they really will be helpless to 
change the pattern. This attitude has been called "learned helplessness." 

The article describes how a computer with well-designed software 
can develop and strengthen a student's feeling of internal control. For 
one thing, a program can give the student a measure of real control over 
the flow of instruction in terms of choosing what to do next (for exam- 
ple, learn new material, review old, or take a quiz), choosing the presen- 
tation speed of new items, and the like. For another, a program can pro- 
vide personalized positive feedback ("You learned that quickly, Ellen!"). 
In fact, a program can demonstrate to students in their own terms that 
they really are learning from it. They're prompted to set goals for them- 
selves; later they're asked to evaluate their own performances in reach- 
ing those goals. 

We have all been warned about becoming dependent on our com- 
puters, but now it seems that computers, intelligently used, can help to 
cure dependency behavior problems. 

There's lots of other good stuff in the issue — a piece on Logo, a 
model for software evaluation, an article on how to find community 
funding for a school computer, and more. 

The Computing Teacher is an elegant and highly readable magazine, 
full of thought-provoking ideas, but it isn't aimed at beginners. If you're 
just getting started with computers, you might be more comfortable with 
one of the commercial magazines. They dress differently from the aca- 
demic journals — slick paper, color, more advertisements — and they 
don't take themselves quite as seriously, but the teachers and other spe- 
cialists among their contributors seem as knowledgeable as those of the 
more serious journals. 

Electronic Education. Despite its high-technology title, this maga- 
zine has a friendly feeling and a general outlook rather like that of a 
group of specialists meeting for coffee after work. In the May/June 1983 
issue, the group starts its meeting by discussing the question, "Are 
schools without computers cheating their students?" The conclusion of 
this article, which is based on a poll of the magazine's contributing edi- 
tors, is unanimously positive, although some feel that the community 
must share responsibility with the schools. The editors end by noting that 
the question will "answer itself before too much more time goes by. The 
next generation of computer literates (or illiterates) will give living testi- 
mony to the answer." 

Another article takes a look at how computers are opening doors for 
handicapped people by giving them tools that help to minimize handi- 
caps. Software that provides enlarged character display or special type- 
faces (such as Higher Text, by Ron and Darryl Aldrich) can be very help- 
ful for people with impaired vision. The article also describes an en- 
larged keyboard that can be made for people with motor-coordination 
problems. 

The lopsided use of microcomputers in most schools is another topic 
the magazine discusses. It points out what administrations are missing 
out on by letting computers sit idle between classes. Another feature ad- 
dresses the urgent need for books to help computer beginners; the mes- 
sage of this article is, "You could probably write one." 

The issue includes a couple of long and thorough courseware re- 
views and a column of news notes, including mention of a number of 
sources of free software. 

Educational Computer. Educational Computer has something of the 
flavor of a hobbyist's magazine. It's always interested in how things 
work — not mechanical things usually (though there's a little of that, too), 
but abstract things, such as computer-managed instruction, touch-typ- 
ing courseware, and computer camps. 



64 



S O F T A L l< 



SEPTEMBER 1983 



The table of contents of each issue offers a brief description of what 
each article in that issue contains. Some highlights from May/June 1983 
are an article on computer-managed instruction describing specific CMI 
software packages and how and where they're being used; and another, 
on computer-assisted instruction in typing, which discusses the perform- 
ances and pedagogical approaches used in four different typing pro- 
grams, with critiques of their potential usefulness. In "Data Processing 
and Special Olympics," we see how a winning team saved time using a 
data management system for a very Special Olympics event. 

You see? Always, the approach is how it works or how people did 
something. You can get ideas from pieces like that. 

Educational Computer also has the hobbyist magazine's collection of 
columns, covering a range from preschoolers to the media center. De- 
partments offer various kinds of news, including answers to ques- 
tions like what's new in courseware? In books? And how good is it? 

Two from Scholastic. If there's anyone who should know how to 
write to an audience of school people — teachers and students — it's Scho- 
lastic, which has been doing it for several decades throughout most of the 
English-speaking world. Its material often combines the viewpoint of the 
hobbyist with the style and polish of the professional. Scholastic has had 
a magazine aimed at teachers and interested adults for a couple of years 
called Electronic Learning, and it's about to start another. 

Electronic Learning is for the hobbyist who has grown into a do-it- 
yourselfer. This publication also describes its articles on the contents 
page, and the descriptions of three out of the four feature articles in the 
April issue begin with "How . . .". The topics of the articles are raising 
SAT scores, retooling your business education curriculum, and explor- 
ing new horizons with Logo. Even the fourth article is a how-to by im- 
plication — it's a buyer's guide to videocassette recorders. 

The columns follow the same pattern, specific and practical; and the 
departments contain news, announcements of new books and software, 
reviews, and information about resources. 

Scholastic's new entry. Teaching and Computers, has a quite different 
flavor. Judging by the preview issue, spring 1983, it's aimed more at the 
beginner than the hobbyist. The introductory editorial says it will have 



material for both groups, but this issue is devoted more to preparing and 
reassuring the beginner than to challenging the hobbyist. 

"A Day in the Life of a Computer-Using Teacher" follows Dr. Beth 
Lazerick through a delightful day: She's clearly in love with the power 
and the challenge of com.puters and she spends her time sharing this love 
with the kindergarteners through sixth-graders of Moreland Elementary 
School in Shaker Heights, Ohio. Her fifth-graders are writing fairly com- 
plex programs, with loops and subroutines; and her sixth-graders are 
studying the programmer job market. 

The other feature articles are "Ten Things To Do the Day the Com- 
puter Arrives," which contains practical suggestions to smooth the first 
meeting between class and computer, and a piece on introducing your 
class to a word processor (which is also helpful in introducing you to a 
word processor if you haven't met one yet). 

The columns and departments are what you would expect from 
Scholastic in this context: extensive and informative. For example, the 
departments include a convention calendar and a question-and-answer 
column dealing with questions teachers ask most about computers. 

And Then Some More. There are several other good magazines in 
the field. T.H.E. Journal (short for Technological Horizons in Education) 
has a format somewhere between a journal and a commercial magazine. 
The magazine focuses on the area of impact between computers and edu- 
cation at every level, from the classroom to the administration to the so- 
ciety beyond. Collegiate Microcomputer, a full-dress academic journal, 
concentrates on college-level applications. 

There's one type of resource we haven't touched on yet. 

Software Directories. Swift's Educational Software Directory is a 
good example of the catalog type of directory, containing brief product 
summaries and simple listings of program specifications as provided by 
the manufacturer. This book doesn't tell you a lot about each program 
but it does tell you about a lot of programs. There are more than four 
hundred pages of listings, with typically five or six programs described on 
each page. 

All the programs listed in the Apple II edition of the Swift directory 
run on the II and II Plus; most also run on the He, which is noted. 

The programs are listed in a standard format, which makes com- 
parisons easy. Each listing includes program name, publisher, a brief de- 
scription of the content, the target audience, any special equipment re- 
quirements, and price. Other information is included if it's available, 
such as a description of support materials, time required to complete the 
program, references to published reviews, and the like. 

The directory includes a master index alphabetized by program name 
and a cross-index alphabetized by publisher and program. The cross-in- 
dex includes publishers' mailing addresses. 

But suppose you need to know more than this? Suppose you want to 
see a critical evaluation of the program — or better, several evaluations — 
before you buy it? Then you may need a different kind of directory: a 
collection of reviews. Read on. 

The Digest of Software Reviews: Education. The Digest doesn't list 
quite as many programs as the Swift directory does, but it gives more in- 
formation about each one (for example, "instructional mode" and "sug- 
gested group size"); and it includes quotes from several published re- 
views. The Digest's publishers. School & Home Courseware, currently 
index and abstract critical reviews from more than sixty journals and 
newsletters. 

A number of other resource books are available — including publish- 
ers' catalogs, another source of useful, if sometimes biased, information. 

A Thought To Make You Smile . . . and Think. All the publica- 
tions we've discussed share at least one goal — to understand and help 
spread that ephemeral quality we call computer literacy. A poem sub- 
mitted by a sixth-grader at Hiawassee Elementary School, Orlando, 
Florida, to JTie Computing Teacher presents a refreshingly simple and 
accurate description of that term. We hope you'll enjoy it.

WHAT IN THE WORLD 
• ISA'MICROZINE?" 



2 



Microzine is an interactive magazine on a 
computer disk, and it can open up the world of 
computer learning to your children more effectively 
than any other children's software available today. 
Microzine comes to you from Scholastic. We've 
been trendsetters in children's publishing for 
over 60 years. Now that traditional teaching 
methods are being enhanced by computer-taught 
materials, Scholastic is ready with the innovation 
that creates an ongoing "dialogue" of fun and 
learning between your children and your com- 
puter. Like a magazine, but unlike other software 
for children, Microzine is constantly current and 
topical. Your children receive a new four-program 
Microzine disk every other month and build 
their own Microzine Library! 



WHAT CAN YOUR 
• CHILDREN DO WITH 
MICROZINE? 



Microzine can help your 9-13-year-olds take 
advantage of one of the most important uses your 
computer can have: exploring new and more effi- 
cient ways of learning and thinking. (If you don't 
own a computer, your children may be able to use 
one at school or a friend's home, or borrow one 
from your local public library.) 

Microzine was created with the recognition that 
today's children take naturally to computers and 
that tomorrow's adults will need to be computer 
literate— no matter what their careers.

WHAT IS "COMPUTER LITERACY" AND HOW 
• DOES MICROZINE HELP ACCOMPLISH IT? 



At Scholastic, we believe that learning how to utilize a computer's wide-ranging capabilities should be 
an important part of every child's education. This kind of computer literacy is no longer an option, but 
a necessity, if our children are to take their places in the computer age. To this end, Microzine is designed 
to spark enthusiasm and teach these essential skills: 



* following directions 

* vocabulary 

* what a computer 
can do 



* learning to use a computer 

* the nature of programming 

* using the keyboard 



* everyday applications 

* word processing 
^ data handling 



* graphics 

* logic 

* parts of a computer 

* problem solving

•WHAT WILL THE FIRST YEAR OF MICROZINE BRING? 



An ever-expanding library of fun and learning! 
Every eight weeks there are four full-length programs and the variety is incredible: 



Who's that trying to solve 
the Mystery at Pinecrest 
Manor, lost in 
the Northwoods 
Adventure and 
challenging the 
far reaches of 
space on Mission 
to Planet XII? 
Could it be some- 
one we know? 
(With Microzine, 
anything is pos- 
sible.) All set for 
takeoff on the 
Space Shuttle — 
or maybe a hot air 
balloon race? Wow! 
(Will Microzine 
ever get down 
to Earth?)

A Schoolhouse Apple 
Tu t o r i a I 

LOGO 

DOflfIA BEARDEI1 

September seems a fitting time to resume the Logo portion of the 
Schoolhouse Apple. Donna Bearden returns to provide challenging Logo 
fim for kids, parents, and teachers. 

The ABCsofXand Y 

Do you know exactly how many steps the Turtle takes from HOME 
to the top of the screen before he wraps? How about to the right before 
he wraps around to the left? If you do, you can begin to position the 
Turtle quite quickly, anywhere you want him, without all those forward, 
back, right, and left commands. 

Let's start with X positions, which are the positions to the right and 
left of HOME. First pick the pen up (PU) and then give a few com- 
mands: SETX followed by a number. If the number gets too high, the 
Turtle will wrap, so the trick is to figure out the highest number he can 
handle without wrapping. If you want him to go to the left-hand side of 
the screen, use SETX followed by a negative number. 

Y positions are the up and down positions. Use SETY followed by a 
positive number to make the Turtle move toward the top of the screen or 
a negative number to make him move toward the bottom. Once again, 
find the highest number you can use before he wraps. 

What happens when you give an X command followed by a Y com- 
mand? 

Once you've experimented with the commands separately, they can 
be combined into one command. If you're using Apple Logo, the com- 
mand to use is SETPOS [40 90] (or whatever numbers you choose). The 
first number is always the X position and the second is always the Y. If 
you're using MIT Logo, the command is SETXY followed by two num- 
bers. In MIT Logo, if the second number (the Y position) is negative, it 
must be enclosed in parentheses. 

If you've never used these commands before, take some time to play 
with them. You'll soon be able to estimate exact positions on the screen. 
If you think you're good enough, maybe you should try a little target 
practice. 

Target. Target is a very simple program that draws a small circle at a 
random position on the screen and then returns the Turtle to HOME. 
The player must try to command the Turtle to land on the target. When 
you first start playing the game you can have three tries to hit the mark. 
A "sure shot" can hit it in one. (But even Annie Oakley had to practice 
a lot.)

Look at the line that tells the Turtle the X and Y positions. The first 
number is RANDOM 260, which tells the computer to pick any num- 
ber between 0 and 260. If you fooled around with very many numbers 
with the X command, you'll realize that 260 will make the Turtle wrap 
completely around the screen and back to HOME. So with one random 
command, we've covered the entire screen. (This number may differ 
slightly from screen to screen.) 

The Y command is a little trickier. We don't want the target to be 
drawn underneath the text lines. Through experimentation, we can de- 
termine that the Turtle can go about 70 steps toward the bottom of the 
screen before he slips behind those text lines, so —70 is as far as we want 
him to go. It's about 1 15 steps to the top. So to cover the screen from top 
to bottom without going behind the text lines, we tell the computer to 
select any number from 0 to 1 15 and then to subtract any number from 0 
to 70. 

By the way, the T procedure was written because it's nicer to be able 



to type T every time you want to play than to have to spell out 
TARGET. 

Connect the Dots. I f you've mastered Target, try your hand at Connect 
the Dots. It's the same concept as Target, but this time the Turtle will 
draw four random dots that you must try to connect in the least number 
of moves. If you go through a dot, that's okay; you can continue on to 
the next one. But you must at least touch all four dots and return to 
HOME. The least number of moves you can take is five — unless you're 
lucky and two of your dots are lined up such that you can pass through 
the first one and land on the second.

Until now, you've only played sreat computer games. 
Now it's time to create your own with PDI's BASIC pro- 
gramming tutorials— The New Step By Step and Step By 
Step Two. 

Our Step By Step programs are the easiest and quickest 
way for you to learn how to use your Apple computer 
and the Applesoft language. 

The New Step By Step 
A Programming Course for Beginners. 

The great thing about the New Step By Step is that it's 
comprehensive. In fact, we've included something that 
no other BASIC tutorial comes with. All our Step By Step 
programs include an audio cassette with the voice of a 
real person, who introduces BASIC concepts and 
explains sample programs as they are displayed on your 
monitor. 

The program will teach you everything from PRINT 
instructions to FOR-NEXT loops. And when your finished 
you'll be able to create programs for word games, low- 
resolution graphics and more. 

Step By Step Two 
Teaches Intermediate Basic Programming. 

After you've learned everything there is to know on the 
New Step By Step, you won't want to stop learning. And 
PDI is ready with Step By Step Two. 

Step By Step Two covers such areas as PEEK and POKE, 
memory maps and hi-res graphics, and will teach you 
enough for you to create full computer graphics, anima- 
tion and sound effects. We even throw in a sample pro- 
gram so you can see what it takes to create a maze game. 

All Step By Step programs come complete with wor'k- 
books, practice problems and backup disks. They're 
boxed in a sturdy vinyl package that stores anywhere. 




Program Design, Inc 95 Easl Pulnam Avenue, Greenwich CT 06830 



In the example shown here, the player connected the dots in six 
moves. 




Another Kind of Dot. The DOT command is another fun way to use 

the X and Y coordinates. By giving the command DOT followed by two 
numbers representing the X and Y coordinates, you can make a dot ap- 
pear at that position on the screen. It's very helpful if you're drawing an 
hourglass with sand trickling through it, plotting a constellation, or 
drawing a face with freckles. 

Here are the commands to draw some freckles. Why don't you see if 
you can draw a face around them! (Note the differences in the Apple and 
MIT versions.) 

Apple: TO FRECKLES 
DOT [20 -14] 
DOT [27 -14] 
DOT [23 -20] 
DOT [-16 -14] 
DOT [-23 -14] 
DOT [-19 -20] 
END 

MIT: TO FRECKLES 
DOT 20 (-14) 
DOT 27 (-14) 
DOT 23 (-20) 
DOT -16 (-14) 
DOT -23 (-14) 
DOT -19 (-20) 
END 

The face shown here is one possibility. 




By combining the RANDOM command we learned in the Target 
game with the DOT command, we could fill up a whole nighttime sky 
with stars. The numbers were changed slightly so the stars wouldn't 
come down quite so far. After experimenting with several possibilities, it 
was decided that DOT LIST (RANDOM 260) (RANDOM 115) - 
(RANDOM 20) was the best choice. Some of the stars may end up on 
the roofs of the tallest houses, but the sky looks more natural if some of 
the stars come down between the houses, so just consider those falling 
stars! 

(For MIT Logo, change all of the SETPOS commands to SETXY. If 
the second number is negative, enclose it in parentheses.) 




CUBE! HUM 






CUBIT. The only 
game of its kind for 
tiie Apple Computer. 

Innovative, new and 
colorful. Cubit 
offers an extra 
dimension. It 
transforms a 
two-dimen- 
sional screen 
to a 3-D arena. 
Cubit offers 
more than just 
the hand/eye 
coordination of 
typical shoot'em- 
up games. It offers fast-moving, action 
filled, strategy based entertainment. 
And you don't have to be a concert

We've waited more than a year to get rid of Bill Budge from that pic- 
ture at the top of this page. So, while he's off looking for more modeling 
gigs, let's get down to some serious fooling around. 

Actually, we're not going to do that much fooling with the Apple this 
time because most of the stuff we're going to cover takes place inside the 
machine where we can't see it. We're going to have a look at how the 
computer counts. 

Numbers are important in computing. On a typical day, a word- 
processing Apple might input, delete, and save tens of thousands of 
words in text. On the same day, it could also run financial programs that 
handle figures in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. That evening, the 
same Apple might rack up millions of points on arcade games. 

Numbers are also important in computing even if you never do any 
KK/Cfl/culating or general ledgering. They're important because the com- 
puter is really just a very big calculator. You've probably heard people 
say that the abacus was one of the earliest computers, and you might 
have tried to imagine someone using it for word processing or playing 
adventures and arcade games. Not much luck, right? Obviously, it isn't 
that kind of computer, but it can do complex calculations. 

Perhaps the most important reason numbers are so vital to a com- 
puter is because that's all it understands. And it understands only two of 
them — zero and one. This crazy method of using just two numbers is 
called the binary system. 

Thinking in terms of numbers is rather complicated, and fortunately 
we don't have to; but it's unfortunate for the computer, since that's all it 
knows. In typical computer stubbornness, the Apple refuses to speak our 
language, so we must be broadminded and speak its tongue. 

Playing by the Numbers. Whether you're typing up a term paper, 
playing a game, or receiving information by modem over the phone lines, 
the computer must receive all information as numbers. When you press a 
key on a keyboard or turn the dial on a game paddle, you're feeding 
numbers into the Apple. In fact, all input, output, and internal opera- 
tions happen in terms of numbers. 

Even though we use these marvelous machines to do more than mar- 
velous things (and sometimes to make marvelous mistakkes), the com- 
puter is really quite a simple piece of work. You were probably quite sur- 
prised to see how few parts there were inside the Apple the first time you 
removed the lid and took a look inside. If so, you'll probably be equally 
surprised to find out that, technically, the computer is really nothing 
more than a lot of switches. 

These switches are in one of two states, on or off; they're just like 
the light switches in the dining room (unless you have one of those dim- 
mer knobs that simulate candlelight for people too cheap to buy real can- 
dles). On or off; yes or no; live free or die. There is no in between. 

In terms of numbers, the state of a switch being off or on is repre- 
sented by the numbers zero and one. Okay, let's count with the Apple. 
Ready, go. Zero, one. . . . Now what? We've run out of numbers; what a 
stupid machine. Before we start condemning it to limbo, let's look at the 
number system that we humans use — the decimal system. 

We have only ten numerals to work with, zero through nine. But as 



soon as we get to nine, we form the number ten by adding another col- 
umn. Thus, ten is represented by 10; in our system, 10 (read as one, zero) 
represents ten, the number that comes after nine. 

The binary system works exactly the same way. We run out of nu- 
merals after we get to one, so we add another column. In this case, 10 (read 
as one, zero) represents two, the number that comes after one. The next 
number, three, is written as 1 1. We're out of numerals again, so it's time 
to add another column; four is written as 100. Getting the hang of it? 

Kid Stuff. Many adults have trouble with this concept of counting in 
terms of zeros and ones because they're so used to the decimal system. 
Kids seem to pick it up with more ease because they're not so convinced 
that decimal is the way the world works. 

In elementary school, we were taught that the number 10 is a one in 
the tens column and a zero in the ones column. In other words, it's one 
ten and no ones. When we get to 99 (nine tens and nine ones), we're out 
of numerals, and we need to add another column. The next number is 
100 (one hundred, no tens, no ones). For one more example, 365 is inter- 
preted as three hundreds, six tens, and five ones. 

And so it is with binary numbers. The figure 10 represents two (one 
two and no ones) and 1 1 represents three (one two and one one). We've 
filled both the twos and the ones columns to represent the number three, 
so the next column would be the fours column; the number four 
would be represented by 100 (one four, no twos, no ones). 

So here we have a nice assortment of zeros and ones; big stinking 
deal. The big deal is that this is where it all ties in to computers. In the 
world of computers, each binary digit (zero or one) is called a bit, which 
comes from binary digi/. Remember all those switches that make up the 
computer? That's what bits are. Depending on how they're combined, 
bits are what the computer uses to represent numeric values, letters, and 
other little creatures. 

To get a clearer idea of how this works, think of our decimal system. 
With three places, we can make numbers from 000 to 999. The value of 
the numeral depends on which numbers are in which places. You could 
have a three with two zeros and get 003. You could have the same num- 
bers in different places and come up with 300. There's an obvious differ- 
ence. It's the same way with bits. Depending on which are ones and 
which are zeros, you get different values. 

Can You Are Ee Ay Dee This? Bits are the smallest pieces of infor- 
mation the Apple deals with, just as letters in the alphabet are the small- 
est things we deal with when we read and write. However, the Apple 
doesn't handle bits one at a time, nor do we read words one letter 
at a time. 

When we see the word Gumby, we read it as Gumby (gum-bee) and 
conjure up an image of a lovable green clay cartoon figure who skates on 
one foot and walks through book covers; we don't read it as G-U-M-B- 
Y (gee you em bee why), visualize five letters in a sequence, and then 
form a mental green clay image. Likewise, picture yourself reading Gone 
with the Wind using the latter method, one letter at a time, and you'll see 
that it would take forever to find out if Rhett Butler gave a damn. Obvi- 
ously, reading words instead of letters is much faster. (Renfing the mov-

ie for home video would be even faster, but that doesn't relate to the sub- 
ject at hand.) 

The Apple doesn't handle bits one at a time, either. It handles them 
in groups of eight; each group of eight bits is known as a byte. In groups 
of eight, we can make strange-looking numbers such as OllOilOO, 
10011100, 00000001, and so on. 

In order, those figures represent the decimal numbers 108, 156, and 1 
respectively. How did we know? Here's how: 

From right to left, the columns of each binary figure are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 
32, 64, and 128. For 01 101 100, we find out what columns the ones are in 
and add those numbers together. In this case, it's 

64 + 32 + 8 + 4 = 108 

For 10011100, it's 

128+16+8+4= 156 

This is fine if you happen to have lots of scratch paper and plenty of pa- 
tience, but there's an easier way. 

Notice that the four columns on the left (128, 64, 32, and 16) are all 
equal to sixteen times the four columns on the right (8, 4, 2, and 1). 
Here's where it becomes easier. Take the binary number 10011100 and 
slice it down the middle into two four-digit numbers, 1001 and 1100, 
which equal 9 and 12 respectively (go ahead, check the math if you 
want). 

Next, take the left-hand half, multiply it by sixteen, and you'll get 

9x16= 144 

Add this to the right-hand side and we'll get the final answer 

144 + 12 = 156 

It's Really Not That Hard. If this concept seems difficult, take a 
look at how the same thing works in decimal. We take a number like 
1,984, break it in half, and we get 19 and 84. Since the two left-hand 
columns (thousands and hundreds) are one hundred times the two right- 



hand columns (tens and ones), we multiply the left-hand side by one hun- 
dred to get 

19 X 100 = 1,900 
Next, we add that to the right-hand side for the final result of 
1,900 I 84 - 1,984 

the official year of the 1984 Summer Olympics. 

But even with this method, numbers like 00101 101 are still hard to 
read. To make things a little easier, the computer gods devised a system 
to change these eight-digit numbers into two-digit ones. They did this by 
changing from a binary (two-numeral) system to a hexadecimal (^'wit^n- 
digit) system; the more numerals we're allowed to work with, the fewer 
times we'll need to add columns to numbers. Having a sixteen-number 
system means having to add columns less frequently. 

The binary system is like a set of one-cup containers. As soon as one 
container (column) is holding one cup of water, you have to have an- 
other one handy if you want to add more. The hexadecimal system is like 
a set of one-gallon containers; you can fill one with sixteen cups before 
you have to add another container. 

Counting with the ABCs. When counting in hexadecimal, we run in- 
to a little problem. After we get to 9, we have six more numbers to go 
before we add another column, but we're out of numerals. The comput- 
er gods have also taken care of this by introducing the alphabet into the 
hexadecimal counting system. So, instead of 0 through 9, we count 0, 1, 
2, 3 ... 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. If you guessed that A through F represent 
numbers ten through fifteen, give youself an A for the day. 

Armed with all this knowledge, we're ready to begin writing num- 
bers like the pros do. Here are a few examples of how hexadecimal 
works:

The big question buzzing through the mind ought to be, "What the 
hecic are those dollar signs doing in there?" That's how computer people 
mark the difference between decimal and hexadecimal. The decimal fig- 
ure for sixty is 60; in hexadecimal, 60 stands for ninety-six (six sixteens 
and no ones). If you're programming and you don't know whether 60 
means sixty or ninety-six, your program may end up doing some things 
stange enough to catch the attention of Leonard Nimoy and the In 
Search of . . . team. 

In short, whenever you see a number preceded by $, it's telling you 
that it's in hexadecimal. 

Deja Vu. Figuring out the values of hexadecimal numbers is similar 
to figuring out binary numbers, but it's a little easier. Start by splitting 
the number down the middle, just as we did with binary numbers. For 
example, $D6 would be chopped into $D and $6. Multiply the left-hand 
side by sixteen to get $D X 16 = 208 (SD equals thirteen, right?). Then 
we just add that result to the right-hand half of $D6, and voila, 

208 + 6 = 214 

Going the other way is just as simple. If you wanted to convert 214 to 
hexadecimal, you'd divide by sixteen to get 214 / 16 = 13, with a re- 
mainder of 6. In other words, it's thirteen sixteens and six ones. We know 
that 13 X 1 6 is equal to SDO, so we just combine that with the remainder 
to get $D6. 

We now have a somewhat firm grip on understanding the binary and 
hexadecimal numbering systems, and we're all better people for it. But 
where all this fits in the scheme of things is still a little unclear. 

Confusion for the Sake of Neatness. Remember that we said eight 
bits make up one byte in the computer. In other words, we can represent 



a byte of information as 01101100, 10011111, or any combinafion of 
zeros and ones from 00000000 to 11111111. But this way of writing num- 
bers is confusing, and it takes up a lot of room. That's why computer 
people prefer to use the hexadecimal system. Decimal numbers are easi- 
er to recognize, but when it comes to dealing with computers, memory 
structures, and bytes, hexadecimal really is tidier. 

Here's what we mean. Boot up DOS and get into the Monitor by the 
usual call —151. Now lype SDO. 3F0L and hit the return key. Those four- 
digit numbers on the left are memory locations, known as addresses. All 
those two-digit numbers to the right are the values currently stored at 
each address. For example, address $03D0 holds 4C, $03D1 holds BF, 
$03D2 holds 9D, and so on. You don't see each address listed, just every 
eighth address. So far, things don't look that much tidier. 

As we said earlier, bytes are represented by the binary numbers be- 
tween 00000000 and 11111111. In decimal, it's between 0 and 255; in 
hexadecimal, it's between $00 and $FF. Clearly, the latter system is 
easier. 

The Apple's memory structure works in a similar way. We could ei- 
ther say that the main RAM is between decimal locations 24576 and 
49152 or that it's between hex locations $6000 and $BFFF. Take your 
pick; hex never felt so good. 

What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been. Finally, we're at the point 
where all these dollar signs, numbers, and letters begin to make a little 
sense. Once you have a grip on the hexadecimal system, a lot of other 
things will be a little easier to understand. Getting used to hexadecimal is 
perhaps the second hardest thing there is in the Apple world. (The hard- 
est thing is figuring out what to do with the cardboard boxes after you've 
unpacked everything. If you don't believe that, just check out the picture 
at the beginning of this column.) 

But now we've brought up some new questions. If the computer un- 
derstands only numbers, then how is it that it can display letters, punctu- 
ation marks, and other symbols? That will be the topic of confusion next 
time. 

Stay tuned, true believers. Hi

The double-high-resolution display mode 
available for the Apple He provides twice the 
horizontal resolution of the standard hi-res 
mode. On a monochrome video monitor, stan- 
dard hi-res displays 280 columns and 192 rows 
of picture elements (pixels); the double-hi-res 
mode displays 560 by 192 pixels. On a color 
monitor, the standard-hi-res mode displays up 
to 140 columns of colors, each being selected 
from the group of six colors available, with cer- 
tain color mixture limitations. Double hi-res 
displays 140 columns of color on which all six- 
teen of the colors available in lo-res can be dis- 
played without any mixing problems. 

Do You Have What It Takes? Installation 
of the double-hi-res mode on your Apple lie de- 
pends on the following three conditions: pres- 
ence of a revision B motherboard; installation 
of an extended eighty-column text card with 
jumper; a video monitor with a bandwidth of at 
least 14 MHz. 

First, your Apple He must have a revision B 
motherboard. To find out whether your lie's 



motherboard is revision B, check the part num- 
ber, which is printed on the motherboard be- 
tween the peripheral slots and the back panel of 
the computer. If the board is a revision B, the 
part number will be 820-0064-B. Double hi-res 
does not work on computers containing a revi- 
sion A motherboard. If your He doesn't con- 
tain a revision B board, and if you want to 
obtain one, contact your local Apple dealer. 

The second condition for using double hi- 
res on your He is that your He must have an ex- 
tended eighty-column text card installed. This 
card must have a jumper connecting the two 
Molex-type pins on the board. ( Warning: If your 
He has an A motherboard, do not make the 
jumper connection on the eighty-column card. 
The system will not work at all if you do. The 
manual that came with the card shows where 
the pins are and how to install the jumper.) 

The last requirement for operation in dou- 
ble-hi-res mode is that your video monitor must 
have a bandwidth of at least 14 MHz. This 
bandwidth is necessary because a television set 



When Apple redesigned the Apple II and put the little e on the case, the company used the new eighty- 
column video capability to boost the resolution of graphics as well as text. There was only one catch. 
Anyone who asked how to use the new double hi-res got the punch line from an old Vermonter's joke: 
You can't get there from here. In our July issue, Don Worth introduced us to the new mode with some 
Applesoft demo programs. He showed us how to get there all right, but like another old Vermonter, he 
showed us the long way. This month. Peter Baum shows us how to do it fast with an in-depth look at 
how double hi-res works and a set of routines by Larry Roddenberry that do double hi-res the easy way: 
machine language called from Applesoft. 



requiring a modulator will not reproduce some 
characters or graphic elements clearly, due to 
the high speed at which the computer sends out 
dots in this mode. The examples we start out 
with will be clearest on a monochrome moni- 
tor — one that displays eighty columns clearly — 
while the color routines at the end will be more 
interesting in color. If you have a video moni- 
tor, color or monochrome, please use it — in- 
stead oF a television set — to display the exam- 
ples that follow. 

Your Turn To Be Creative — Or, Volun- 
teers, Anyone? There are no commercial pro- 
grams that support double-hi-res graphics yet. 
Moreover, none of the standard-hi-res com- 
mands (such as hplot) work properly in double- 
hi-res mode. We'll provide the basic color-line- 



drawing commands in this article, but there is a 
need for shape-drawing routines, fill routines, 
and a body of other material before we can get 
full use of double hi-res. Until such routines are 
available, users must write their own. If you've 
gotten this far and want to continue, you'll 
probably already have used the system Moni- 
tor, and you'll need very few explanations. If 
you have no experience with the Monitor, refer 
to the Apple lie Reference Manual before try- 
ing to follow the examples given here. 

You should also be acquainted with stan- 
dard-hi-res functions. If you aren't, obtain the 
A pple He Reference Manual or the A pple II Ref- 
erence Manual and read the sections on high- 
resolution graphics before proceeding.

The color bleeding in normal hi-res 

these features in the Apple II Graphics column 
by Ken Williams in Softline magazine. The 
series began with the first issue, September 
1981, and back issues are available from Sof- 
talk Publishing. The early columns are espe- 
cially useful. 

The tutorial that occupies the rest of this ar- 
ticle assumes you are working at your Apple He 
as you read. Before you start, be sure you have 
a jumpered extended eighty-column card in 
your revision B Apple He. 

Hands-On Practice with Standard Hi-Res. 
The Apple lie hi-res graphics display is bit- 
mapped. In other words, each dot on the screen 
corresponds to a bit in the Apple He's memory. 
For a real-life example of bit-mapping, per- 
form the following procedure, according to the 
instructions that follow. Be sure to hit return 
after typing each command. 

1 . Boot the system, using the DOS System

bytes). In the screen display, the least signifi- 
cant bit of each byte appears as the leftmost 
pixel in a group of seven pixels. The second least 
significant bit corresponds to the pixel directly 
to the right of the pixel previously displayed, 
and so on. To watch this procedure in action, 
follow the steps listed below. The dots will 
appear in the middle of your screen. 

1. Type 2028:1. 

2. Type 2828:2. 

3. Type 3028:4. 

The three bits you specified in this exercise cor- 
respond to three pixels displayed one after an- 
other, from left to right. 

The most significant bit in each byte does 
not correspond to a pixel. Instead, this bit is 
used to shift the position of the other seven bits 
in the byte. For a demonstration of this feature, 
follow the steps listed below: 

1. Type 205a- 

2. Type 2850:8. 

3. Type 3050:8. 

You'll notice that the dots align themselves ver- 
tically. Now: 

4. Type 2450:88. 

The new dot (that is, the one corresponding to 
the bit you just specified) does not line up with 
the dots you displayed earlier. Instead, it ap- 
pears to be shifted one "half dot" to the right. 

5. To demonstrate that this dot really is a 
"new" dot and not just the "old" dot 
shifted by one dot position, type 2050.75, 
2850:18. 

You'll notice that the dot mentioned in step 4 
(the dot that was not aligned with the other seven 



isn't a problem across the whole sixteen-color range of double hi-res. 



Master disk. 

2. When the Applesoft prompt appears, 
press control-reset. 

3. Engage the caps-lock key, and type hgr. 
(This instruction should clear the top of 
the screen.) 

4. Type call —151. (The system is now in 
the Monitor mode, and the prompt 
should appear as an asterisk.) 

5. Type 2100:1. One single dot should ap- 
f)ear in the upper left-hand corner of the 
screen. 

You have just plotted a hi-res pixel. (Not an 
astonishing feat, but you have to start some- 
where. . . .) 

With a black-and-white monitoi , the bits in 
memory have a simple correspondence with the 
dots (pixels) on-screen. A dot of light appears if 
the corresponding bit is on (has a value of 1) but 
remains invisible if the bit is off (has a value of 



0). (The dot is white on a black-and-white moni- 
tor, and green on a green-screen monitor, such 
as Apple's Monitor III. For simplicity, we shall 
refer to an invisible dot as black and a visible 
one as white.) Two visible dots located next to 
each other appear as a single wide dot, and 
many adjacent dots appear as a line. To obtain 
a display of another dot and a line, follow the 
steps listed below. 

1. Type 2080:40. A dot should appear 
above and to the right of the dot you 
produced in the last exercise. 

2. Type 2180:7F. A small horizontal line 
should appear below the first dot you 
produced. 

From Bits and Bytes to Pixels. The seven 
low-order bits in each display byte control seven 
adjacent dots in a row. A group of forty consec- 
utive bytes in memory controls a row of 280 
dots (seven dots per byte, multiplied by forty

dots) is straddled by the dots above and below 
it. (The use of magnifying lenses is permitted.) 

Shifting the pixel one half dot by setting the 
most significant bit is most often used for color 
displays. When the high bit of a byte is set to 
generate this shifted dot (which is also called the 
half-dot shift), all the dots for that byte will be 
shifted one half dot. The half-dot shift does 
not exist in the double-hi-res mode for the 
Apple lie. 

Figure 1 shows the memory map for the 
standard hi-res graphics mode. Each block 
shown represents an area seven pixels wide and 
eight pixels high on the hi-res screen. One block 
is blown up and broken down to show the rela- 
tive memory layout. Each row of seven boxes in 
the blown-up block represents one byte of mem- 
ory, each box in the row representing one pixel 
or bit. The address of any given byte of hi-res 
memory is determined by adding the hexadeci- 
mal numbers (shown in the figure) of the 
block's column and row to the hex number cor- 
responding to its byte within its block. 

For example, the first memory address of 
each screen line for the first few lines is $2(X)0, 
$2400, $2800, S2C00, and so on. Those are all 
within the first block: $2000 (the number to the 
left of the block's row) plus $00 (the number at 
the top of that column) plus $0, $400, $800, and 
$C00 (the numbers of the corresponding bytes 
in the blown-up block). 

The Intricacies of Double Hi-Res. Because 
the double-hi-res graphics mode provides twice 
the horizontal dot density as standard hi-res 



does, double hi-res requires twice as much 
memory as standard hi-res. If you spent many 
hours memorizing the standard-hi-res memory 
map, don't despair. Double hi-res still uses the 
hi-res graphics page, but only to represent half 



the picture, so to speak. In the double-hi-res 
mode, the hi-res graphics page is compressed to 
fit into half of the display. The other half of the 
display is stored in memory on the extended 
eighty-column card (called the auxiliary or aux 
memory). (This article refers to the standard-hi- 
res graphics page, which resides in main mem- 
ory, as the motherboard or MB memory.) 

The auxiliary memory uses the same ad- 
dresses used by the standard-hi-res graphics 
page 1 ($2000 through $3FFF). The hi-res 
graphics page in auxiliary memory is known as 
hi-res page IX. The graphics pages in auxiliary 
memory are bank-switched memory, which you 
can switch in by activating some of the soft 
switches. (Adventurous readers may want to 
skip ahead to the section of the article headed 
"Using the Auxiliary Memory.") 

The memory mapping for the hi-res graph- 
ics display is analogous to the technique used 
for the eighty-column display. The double-hi-res 
display interleaves bytes from the two different 
memory pages (auxiliary and motherboard). 
Seven bits from a byte in the auxiliary memory 
bank are displayed first, followed by seven bits 
from the corresponding byte on the mother- 
board. The bits are arranged in the same way as 
in standard hi-res (least significant bit first). In 
double hi-res, the most significant bit of each 
byte is ignored; thus, no half-dot shift can 
occur. (This feature is important, as you'll see 
when we examine double-hi-res color.) 

The memory layout for double hi-res is 
similar to that of standard hi-res. Each block, 
however, is broken down into eight rows of 
fourteen pixels each, seven pixels in each row 
coming from a byte of auxiliary memory and 
the other seven pixels coming from mother- 
board memory. Figure 2 shows the double-hi- 
res version of the blown-up block in figure 1.

Annunciator 3 (AN3) must be turned off to 
get into double-hi-res mode. You turn it off by 
reading location 49246 ($C05E). Note that 
whenever you press control-reset, AN3 is 
turned on; therefore, each time you press con- 
trol-reset, you must turn AN3 off again. 

If you are using MIXED mode, then the 
bottom four lines on the screen will display text. 
If you have not turned on the eighty -column 
card, then every second character in the bot- 
tom four lines of text will be a random charac- 
ter. (The reason is that although the hardware 
displays eighty columns of characters, the firm- 
ware updates only the forty-column screen, 
which consists of the characters in the odd- 
numbered columns. The characters in even- 
numbered columns then consist of random 
characters taken from text page IX in the aux- 
iliary memory.) 

To remove the even characters from the bot- 
tom four lines on the screen, type PRjj^i from 
Basic (type 3 control-P from the Monitor). This 
activates the eighty-column firmware and clears 
the memory locations on page IX. 

Using the Auxiliary Memory. The auxil- 
iary memory consists of several sections, which 
you can select by using the soft switches in the 
list that follows. A pair of memory locations is 
dedicated to each switch. (One location turns 
the switch on; the other turns it off) You acti- 
vate a switch by writing to the appropriate 
memory location. The WRITE instruction it- 
self is what activates the switch; therefore, it 
doesn't matter what data you write to the mem-

A routine called AUXMOVE, located in 
the Monitor ROM of the Apple lie, is also 
handy. AUXMOVE is located at address 
$C311. 

Manipulating the auxiliary memory with 
the soft switches has the following idiosyncra- 
sies. Figure 3 is a set of memory maps showing 
the active banks based on various switch set- 
tings. The figure should clarify the descriptions. 

1. To activate the PAGE2 and HIRES 
switches, you need only read (peek) 
from the corresponding memory lo- 
cations (instead of writing to them, as 
you do for the other three switches). 

2. The PAGE2 switch normally selects 
the display page, in either graphics or 
text mode, from either page 1 or page 



2 of the motherboard memory. How- 
ever, it does so only when the 
80STORE switch is off 

3. If the 80STORH .switch is on, then 
the function on the PAGE2 switch 
changes. When 80STORE is on, 
PAGE2 switches in the text page, lo- 
cations $400— 7FF, from auxiliary 
memory (text page I X), instead of 
switching the display screen to the al- 
ternate video page (page 2 on the 
motherboard). When 80STORE is 
on, the PAGE2 switch determines 
which memory bank (auxiliary or 
motherboard) is used during any ac- 
cess to addresses $400 through 7FF. 
When the 80STORE switch is on, it 
has priority over all other switches. 

4. If the 80STORE switch is on, then the 
PAGE2 switch only switches in the 
graphics page IX from the auxiliary 
memory // the HIRES switch is also 
on. (Note that this circumstance is 
slightly different from that described 
in item 3.) When 80STORE is on, and 
if the HIRES switch is also on, the 
PAGE2 switch selects the memory 
bank (auxiliary or motherboard) for 
accesses to a memory location within 
the range $2000 through 3FFF. If the 
HIRES switch is off any access to a 
memory location within the range 
$2000 through 3FFF uses the mother- 
board memory, regardless of the state

of the PAGE2 switch. 
5. If the 80STORE switch is off, and 
if the RAMRD and RAMWRT 
switches are on, then any read- 
ing or writing to address space 
$200-$BFFF gains access to the aux- 
iliary memory. If only one of the 
switches — for example, RAMRD — is 
set, only the approriate operation, in 
this case a read, will be performed on 
the auxiliary memory, while a write 
operation will affect only the mother- 
board memory. If only RAMWRT is 
set, then all write operations go to 
the auxiliary memory. When the 
80STORE switch is on, it has higher 
priority than the RAMRD and 
RAMWRT switches. 
Shortcuts: Writing to Auxiliary Memory 

from the Keyboard. First, press control-reset. 

Next, type call —151 to get into the Monitor. 

Then type the following hexadecimal addresses 

to turn on the double-hi-res mode: 

C057 (forhi-res) 

C050 (for graphics) 

C053 (for mixed mode) 

COSE (turns off AN3 for double hi-res) 

COOD:0 (turns on the 80COL switch) 

This procedure usually causes the display of a 
random-dot pattern at the top of the screen, 
while the bottom four lines on the screen con- 
tain text. To clear the screen, follow these steps: 

1. Type 3 DOG to return to Basic. 

2. Type HGR to clear half of the screen. 
(The characters you type will prob- 
ably appear in alternating columns. 
This is not a cause for alarm; as noted 
earlier, the firmware simply thinks 
you are working with a forty-column 
display.) Remember that hi-res 
graphics commands don't know 
about the half of the screen stored on 
page IX in the auxiliary memory. 
Therefore, only page 1 (that is, the 
first halO of the graphics page on the 
motherboard is cleared. As a result, in 
the screen display, only alternate sev- 
en-bit columns appear cleared. 

On the other hand, if all of the screen col- 
umns were cleared after the HGR command, 
then chances are good that you're not in dou- 
ble-hi-res mode. If your screen was cleared, you 
should determine which mode you're in. Type 
the following instructions: 

CALL -151 
2000: FF 

200K2000.2027M 

If a solid line appears across the top of the 
screen, you're not in double-hi-res mode. (The 
line that appears should be a dashed or in- 
termittent line.) If you're not in double hi-res, 
then make sure that you do have a B mother- 
board and that the two Molex-type pins on the 
extended eighty-column card are shorted to- 
gether with the jumper block. Then retype the 
instructions listed previously. 

If you're staring at a half-cleared screen, you 



can clear the nonblank coiums by writing zeros 
to addresses $2000 through $3FFF on graphics 
page IX of auxiliary memory. To do so, simply 
turn on the 80STORH switch, turn on the 
PAGE2 switch, and then write to locations 
$2000, $2001, $2002, and so on up through 
$3FFF. However, this procedure will not work 
if you try it from the Monitor! The reason is 
that each time you invoke a Monitor routine, 
the routine sets the PAGE2 switch back to page 
1 so that it can display the most recent com- 
mand you entered. When you try to write to the 
hi-res memory on the auxiliary card, it will write 
to the motherboard memory instead. 

Another way to obtain the desired result is 
to use the Monitor's user command, which forc- 



es a jump to memory location $3F8. You can 
place a J MP instruction starting at this mem- 
ory location so that the program will jump to a 
routine that writes into hi-rcs page IX. For- 
tunately, the Monitor already contains such a 
routine: AUXMOVE. 

Using AUXMOVE. You use the AUX- 
MOVE routine to move data blocks between 
main and auxiliary memory. But the task still 
remains of setting up the routine so that it 
knows which data to write and where to write it. 
To use this routine, some byte pairs in zero page 
must be set up with the data block addresses, 
and the carry bit must be fixed to indicate the 
direction of the move. You may not be sur- 
prised to learn that the byte pairs in zero page

used by AUXMOVE are also the scratch-pad 
registers used by the Monitor during instruc- 
tion execution. The result is that, while you type 
the addresses for the Monitor's move com- 
mand, those addresses are being stored in the 
byte pairs used by AUXMOVE. Thereafter, 
you can call the AUXMOVE command direct- 
ly, using the user (control-Y) command. 

In practice, then, enter the following in- 
structions:

2000<2000.3FFF (control-Y activates the

The syntax for this user command is 
AUXdesK MBstart.MBend control-Y. 

The command copies the values in the range 
MBstart to MBend in the motherboard mem- 
ory into the auxiliary memory beginning at 
AUXdest. This command is analogous to the 
move command. 

You can use this procedure to transfer any 
block of data from the motherboard memory to 
hi-res page IX. Working directly from the key-

(that is, the image that will be displayed in the 
even-numbered columns of the double-hi-res 
picture) must first be stored in the mother- 
board memory. You can then use the control-Y 
Monitor command to transfer the image to hi- 
res page IX. 

The AUXMOVE routine uses the RAM- 
RD and RAMWRT switches to transfer the 
data blocks. Because the 8C6TORE switch over- 
rides the RAMRD and RAMWRT switches, 
the 80STORE switch must be turned off- 
otherwise, it would keep the transfer from 
occurring properly (hence the write to SCOOO 
mentioned earlier). 

If the 80STORE, PAGEl, and HIRES switch- 
es are on when you execute AUXMOVE, 
then any access to an address located within the 
range from S2000 to $3FFF inclusive would 
use the motherboard memory, regardless of 
how RAMRD and RAMWRT are set. Enter- 
ing the command C000:0 turns off 80STORE, 
thus letting the RAMRD and RAMWRT 
switches control the memory banking. 

The control-Y trick described above works 
only for transferring data blocks from the main 
(motherboard) memory to auxiliary memory 
(because the Monitor always enters the 
AUXMOVE routine with the carry bit set). To 
move data blocks from the auxiliary memory to 
the main memory, you must enter AUXMOVE 
with the carry bit clear. You can use the routine 
listed below to transfer data blocks in either 
direction: 



301 :AD 0 3 



304 :2A

dress $300 into the accu-

icant bit into the carry 
nag) 

(jump to $C3I1-AUX- 
MOVE) 

(sets tiie control-Y com- 
mand to jump to address 
$301) 



Before using this routine, you must modify 
memory location $300, depending on the direc- 
tion in which you want to transfer the data 
blocics. If the transfer is from the auxiliary 
memory to the motherboard, you must clear 
location $300 to zero. If the transfer is from the 
motherboard to the auxiliary memory, you 
must set location $300 to $FF. 

Two Double-Hi-Res Pages. So far, we've 
only discussed using graphics pages 1 and IX to 
display double-hi-res pictures. But — analogous 
to the standard-hi-res pages 1 and 2 — two 
double-hi-res pages exist: pages 1 and IX, at 
locations $2(K)0 through $3FFF, and pages 2 
and 2X, at locations $4000 through $5FFF. The 
only trick in displaying the second double-hi-res 
page is that you must turn off the 80STORE 
switch. If the 80STORE switch is on, then only 
the first page (1 and IX) is displayed. Go ahead 
and try it: 

COOOiO (to turn off the 80STORE switch) 
C055 (to turn on the PAGE2 switch) 

The screen will fill up with another display 
of random bits. Clear the screen using the in- 
structions listed in the section headed "Using 
AUXMOVE." However, this time, use ad- 
dresses $4000 through $5FFF instead. (Don't 
be alarmed by the fact that the figures you're 
typing aren't displayed on the screen. They're 
being "displayed" on text page 1.) 

4000:0 

4001 <4000.5FFFM 

4000 < 4000. 5FFF control-Y 

You'll be delighted to learn that you can 
also use this trick to display two eighty-column 
text screens. The only problem here is that the 
eighty-column firmware continually turns on 
the 80STORE switch, which prevents the dis- 
play of the second eighty-column screen. How- 
ever, if you write your own eighty-column dis- 
play driver, then you can use both of the eighty- 
column screens. 

Color Madness. It should come as no sur- 
prise that color-display techniques in double hi- 
res are different from color-display techniques 
in standard hi-res. This is because the "half-dot 
shift" doesn't exist in double-hi-res mode. 

In the following examples, the term color 
monitor refers to either an NTSC monitor or a 
color television set. Both work; however, the 
displays will be much harder to see on the tele- 
vision. The generation of color in double hi-res 
demands sacrifices. A 560-by- 1 92-dot display is 
not possible in color. Instead, the horizontal 
resolution decreases by a factor of four (to 140 
dots across the screen). Just as with a black -and 
white monitor, a simple correspondence exists 
between memory and the pixels on the screen. 
The difference is that four bits are required to 



determine each color pixel. These four bits rep- 
resent sixteen different combinations: one for 
each of the colors available in double hi-res. 
(These are the same colors that are available in 
lo-res.) 

Let's start by exploring the pattern that 
must be stored in memory to draw a single col- 
ored line across the screen. Start by pressing re- 
set; then load the program Color Test from the 
DOS 3.3 Sample Programs disk (with the old 
Apple DOS System Master use the program 
Color Demosoft). Use this program to adjust the 
colors displayed by your monitor. After you've 
adjusted the colors, exit from the program. 

The instructions that follow are divided in- 
to groups separated by blank lines. Because it's 
very difficult (and, on a TV set, almost impos- 
sible) to read the characters you're typing in as 
they appear on-screen, face it: You will make 
typing errors. If the instructions appear not to 
work, then start again from the beginning of a 
group of instructions.

In contrast to conditions in standard hi-res, 
no half-dot shift occurs, and the most signifi- 
cant bit of each byte is not used. 

As noted above, four bits determine a col- 
or. You can paint a single-color line across the 
screen simply by repeating a four-bit pattern 
across the screen. But it is much easier to write a 
whole byte rather than just change four bits at a 
time. Since only seven bits of each byte are dis- 
played (as noted earlier in our discussion of 
black-and-white double hi-res) and the pattern 
is four bits wide, it repeats itself every twenty- 
eight bits or four bytes. Use the following in- 
structions to draw a line of any color across

As may be inferred from figure 4, the abso- 
lute position of a byte also determines the color 
displayed. If you write an 8 into the first byte at 
the far left side of the screen (in the auxl col- 
umn), then a red dot is displayed. But if you 
write an 8 into the third byte at the left side of 
the screen (the aux2 column), then a dark green 
dot is displayed. Remember: The color moni- 
tor decides which color to display based on the 
relative position of the bits on each line (that is, 
on how far the bits are from the left edge of the 
screen). 

So far, so good. But suppose you want to 
display more than one color on a single line. It's 
easy: Just change the four-bit pattern that is 
stored in memory. For example, if you want the 
left half of the line to be red and the right half to 
be purple, then store the red pattern (8,11,22, 
44) in the first forty bytes of the line, and then 
store the purple pattern (19,33,66,4C) in the sec- 
ond forty bytes of the line. Figure 4 is a useful 
reference tool for switching from one color to 
another, provided you make the change on a 
byte boundary. In other words, you must start a 
new color at the same point in the pattern at 
which the old color ended. For example, if the 
old color stops after you write a byte from the 
mbl column, then you should start the new 
color by storing the next byte in memory with a 
byte from the aux2 column. 



For instance, 

2028:11 44 11 44 11 44 11 77 5D 77 
5D 77 5D 

creates a dashed line that is red, then yellow. 
Then, 

2128: 8 22 8 22 8 22 8 22 6E 3B 
6E 3B 6E 

2028 < 2128.2134 control-Y 
fills in the rest of the colors. 

Switching Colors in Mid-Byte. If you want 
a line to change color in the middle of a byte, 
you'll have to recalculate the column, based on 
the information in figure 4. Suppose you want 
to divide the screen into three vertical sections, 
each a different color. The left-hand third of the 
screen ends in the middle of the twenty-seventh 
character from the left edge — that is, in an aux2 
column of the color table. (Dividing 27 by 4 
gives a remainder of 3, which indicates the third 
column, or aux2.) Your pattern should change 
from the first color to the second color after the 
fifth bit of the twenty-seventh byte. You can 
change the color in the middle of a byte by 
selecting the appropriate bytes from the aux2 
column of figure 4 and concatenating two bits 
for the second color with five bits for the first 
color. 

However, because the bits from each byte 
are shifted out in order from least significant to 
most significant, the two most significant bits 
(in this case bits 5 and 6, because bit 7 is un- 
used) for the second color are concatenated 
with the five least significant bits for the first 
color. For instance, if you want the color to 
change from orange (the first color) to green 
(the second color), then you must append the 
two most significant bits (5 and 6) of green to 
the five least significant bits (0 through 4) of 
orange. In figure 4, the aux2 column byte for 
green is $19, and the two most significant bits 
are both clear. The aux2 column byte for 
orange is $33, and the five least significant bits 
are equal to 1001 1. The new byte calculated from 
appending green (00) to orange (1(301 1) yields $13 
(0010011). Therefore, the first twenty-six bytes 
of the line come from the table values for 
orange; the twenty-seventh byte is $13, and the 
next twenty-six bytes come from the table 
values for green.

There you have it: a basic explanation of 
how double hi-res works — except for one or 
two anomalies. The first anomaly is that NTSC 
monitors have a limited display range. The sec- 
ond anomaly shows one of the features of dou- 
ble hi-res versus a limitation of standard hi-res.

SOFTAI 1^ 



SEPTEMBER 1983 



An NTSC color monitor decides what col- 
or to display based on its "view" of four-bit 
"windows" in each line, starting from the left 
edge of the screen. The monitor looks at the 
first four bits, determines which color is called 
for, and then shifts one bit to the right and de- 
termines the color for this new four-bit win- 
dow. But remember, the color depends not only 
on the pattern, but also on the position of the 
pattern. To compensate for relative position 
from the left edge of the screen, the monitor 
keeps track of where on each line each of these 
windows starts. (For those of you of the techni- 
cal persuasion, this is done through the use of 
the color burst signal, which is a 3.58 MHz 
clock.) 

Try this example:

Notice that if the blue box was drawn at the 
top of the screen, next to the orange box, they 
would overlap. Yet, the boxes were drawn on 
two different columns, orange on mb2 and blue 
on auxl . This can be explained by the previous 
paragraph and the sliding windows. The moni- 
tor will detect the pattern for orange slightly af- 
ter the mb2 column, while the pattern for blue 
shows up before column auxl. 

Look at four-bit windows and you'll see 
that the orange pattern overlaps on both sides.

If a pattern is repeated on a line, this over- 
lap doesn't cause a problem, since the same col- 
or just overlaps itself. But watch what happens 
when a new pattern is started next to a different 
pattern.

Where the blue overlaps the orange, you'll 
see a white dot. This is because in one of the 
four-bit windows the monitor sees all Is. If two 
colors are placed right next to each other, the 
monitor will sometimes display a third color, or 
fringe, right at the boundary. Fringing is espe- 
cially noticeable when there are a lot of narrow 
columns of different colors next to each other. 
(Next time you run Color Test take a look at 
the boundaries between the colors.) 

Note the four Is in a row at the boundary 
between orange and blue.

The Double-Hi-Res Routines. The second 
anomaly presents a good lead-in to the last part 
of this series, the double-hi-res routines, which 
plot lines. These routines work like the stan- 
dard-hi-res Applesoft commands, hgr, hcolor, 
and hplot, except that they use the Applesoft 
ampersand function. The listing for the rou- 
tines is at the end of the article. 

There are four ampersand functions: 

&H (clears double-hi-res screen) 
&Cn (sets the double-hi-res color to ri) 
&Px,y (plots a point at x,y) 
Six,/ (draws a line from the last point to 
.v.r) 

TEXT:POKE 49164, 0:POKE 

49247, 0(returns to 40-column text mode) 

The double-hi-res screen has 140 columns, 
numbered 0 through 139, and 192 rows, num- 



bered 0 to 191. Just like the standard-hi-res 
screen, the origin is in the upper left corner, 
while the point 139,191 is in the bottom right 
corner. 

The color codes are the same as for lo-res 
graphics: 



0. black 

1 . magenta 

2. dark blue 

3. violet 

4. dark green 

5. greyl 

6. medium blue 

7. light blue 



8. brown 

9. orange 

10. grey2 

1 1 . pink 

12. green 

13. yellow 

14. aqua 

15. white 



Some exercises you may want to try include 
painting the left half of the screen with greyl 
and the right half with grey2 to see if they are 
different or moving a colored ball on different 
colored backgrounds. If you're the adven- 
turous type, you may want to rewrite Brickout. 

The following program shows off double hi- 
res (it requires that the ampersand routines be 
on disk with the name Color Dbl Hires). It 
starts with the color bar demo, except in this 
case the color bars can be much narrower than 
was possible in lo-res graphics. The next screen 
shows a simple picture of an orange line drawn 
diagonally on a green background. These two 
colors are also available in standard hi-res, but 
as you'll see in the next picture there are certain 
limitations.

Top: a picture of a screen from Brian's Theme, the hi-res demo program that dates back at least as far 
as DOS, Bottom: a new double-hi-res Brian's Theme, complete with multiple overlapping colors. The 
"new theme" was created by the program on this page, using the routines at the end of this article. 



In double hi-res the most significant bit is 
not used, and any color can appear next to any 
other color, anywhere on the screen (though 
fringing can occur where the colors join). In 
standard hi-res the most significant bit of each 
byte limits that byte to four of the six colors. If 
the MSB is set, the only colors displayed by that 
byte are white, black, blue, and orange. When 
an orange line passes through the blue byte, the 
MSB is set, so the whole byte becomes orange 
and the stair step line appears. 

Here's a more impressive demo, reminis- 
cent of the venerable Brian's Theme.

turned off when a jumpered extended eighty- 
column card is present, the most significant bit 
of standard hi-res isn't used either. This means 
that any standard-hi-res picture will display 
only black, white, violet, or green. If the picture 
contains blue or orange, then those colors will 
be converted to violet or green. Go ahead and 



try it: Pull out a game that uses all four colors, 
turn the AN3 off with peek 49246, and then, 
without pressing reset (since that sets AN3 on), 
run the program. 

Now you've got the tools and the rules to 
the double-hi-res mode. As you can see, double 
hi-res has more color with higher resolution than 



standard hi-res. You can even develop games 
that do fancy animation or scroll orange ob- 
jects across green backgrounds. In black and 
white, word processing programs that use dif- 
ferent fonts of proportional character sets can 
be developed. Have fun playing with this new 
mode.

Recognize some of these "key" 
characters? You've seen them all 
before on your Apple® II screen, but 
now the Enhancer II has given them all 
new identities! 

The Enhancer II uniquely gives your 
Apple II user-definable keys. So you can 
define any key to become what you 

want it to be. That means 
phrases, paragraphs 
or commands that 
you use firequently 
(up to 510 charac- 
ters!) can be re- 
membered by the 
Enhancer II and then 
called up at the touch 
of a single key. 

Besides that, the 
Enhancer II gives your Apple II type- 
writer mode, with each key assuming the 




identity of a conven- 
tional typewriter key. Not 
only will you recognize all 
the characters; you'll posi- 
tively rejoice at having 
upper and lowercase letters, 
auto repeat, shift and shift lock 
again! The Enhancer II also has a type- 
ahead buffer of 128 characters, so you 
can keep sending messages to your 
Apple II even while it's busy with 
something else. 

And if you want to meet even more new 
characters, the optional Function Strip™ 
will introduce you to 16 brand-new keys 
across the top of your keyboard which 
are yours alone to define. (These charac- 
ters will never get mixed up with charac- 
ters fi:-om the keyboard!) 



We may be prejudiced, but we 
think you're going to like these new 

"key" characters ft'om Enhancer II. In 
fact, we'll bet that once you've seen 
them perform, they'll become the 
stars of your screen.

VENTURES WITH 
VISICALC 

BV JOE SHELTOn 



Some financial templates, such as the one we constructed two 
months ago to help you maintain your correct checking-account bal- 
ance and analyze your tax deductions, are useful year in and year out. 
Other kinds of financial templates may be used less often but may be 
equally valuable tools for analyzing your financial position. 

This month we'll create a template designed to help you truly under- 
stand the cost of borrowing money. In the course of things we'll also 
learn how to save money by comparing loan rates, and we'll consider the 
savings that may be involved in paying off a loan early. 

Buying a car is the second most important investment most people 
will make in their lives (a home is the first). We'll use buying a car as the 
example in our template, although the template can apply to almost any 
normal loan situation. When a balloon payment structure is involved, 
the CTiteria change slightly, but the template we're going to design can 
handle that kind of situation with only minor modificadons. 

Buying a Car. Let's set the scene. You've decided you're going to 
buy a really good car. You go to the dealer, find the car you like, and 
haggle over the price. Let's say the car you decide on retails for $16,872. 
After a lot of haggling, the nice people at the dealership decide they like 
you and are willing to give you a deal! You get the car for $16,800. At 
this point, you can either get the dealer to determine the financing or go 
to a bank and arrange your own financing. Deciding to do the latter, you 
run to your finance person, who says that in order to get a loan you must 
make a 10 percent down payment on the car. That means you need 
$1,680 in cash. Once you've gotten that, the finance company will lend 
you the remainder of the money at 13 percent. 

You decide to put $1,800 down. After doing some figuring, your fi- 
nance person tells you that your monthly payment on $15,000 is a low 
$505.41 for thirty-six months. You hesitate momentarily; that is more 
than you wanted to pay. But you have to have the car! So you agree, 
withdraw the down payment from your bank account, and — et voila — 
the car is yours. All you have to do is be sure to put a check in the mail to 
the vendor once a month. 

Hold it a second. Have you ever stopped to think how much money 
you're actually paying the finance company for the use of their money? 
Have you ever determined how much quicker the loan would be paid off 
if you paid a little more each month? Or how much less it might cost if 
you paid the loan off quicker? If you're like most people, you haven't 
given these questions a great deal of thought. Once you've completed this 
template, however, you'll have no excuse for not knowing how much 
you're paying in interest; and knowing this should help you make more 
informed financial decisions. 

Compounding the Problem. The first thing you must understand is 
the compounding effect that the interest rate has on your loan. Each 
month's payment includes a percentage for reducing the principal; the re- 
mainder goes toward interest. In the beginning, the interest component 
of your monthly payment will probably exceed the component that's ap- 
plied to the principal. That means that the quicker you pay off the loan, 
the less interest you'll have to pay. Most loans do permit early repay- 
ment, though some require an early payment penalty. 

For example, borrowing $15,000 at 15 percent per annum for four 
years requires a monthly payment of $417.46. Multiplying the monthly 
payment by forty-eight months reveals that you have made total pay- 
ments of $20,038.08. In other words, you've paid $5,038.08 in interest ex- 



pense alone. Arranging to pay off that same loan over three years would 
put your monthly payments at $519.98, but the total interest expense 
would be only $3,719.28. That's a difference of $1,318.86 in interest ex- 
pense. You can see that it might make sense to pay off the loan as quick- 
ly as possible. (Of course, it's also worthwhile to consider what effect in- 
flation might have on this whole business.) 

If you already have a loan, why not plug it into this model? All you 
have to do is find out the pertinent information for the current month. 

Begin at the Beginning. When attempting to solve any problem, it's 
best to begin by considering what you want to accomplish and what 
components are required. In our example, the elements are an initial loan 
amount (called the principal) and the monthly payments that you must 
make for a specified period of fime. In addition, the bank must consider 
the interest rate in order to determine how much of your monthly pay- 
ment will go toward the principal and how much will be counted as in- 
terest payment. Each month the bank calculates the amount of the inter- 
est payment by taking the monthly interest rate times the remaining prin- 
cipal. The remainder of your payment (the principal payment) is deduct- 
ed from the principal, and the balance is the principal balance for the 
following month. 

Our simple model operates under a couple of assumptions. The first 
is that any regular or extra payments made on the loan must be made on 
the day the original payment is due. The second is that if you mail your 
payment late you'll be charged interest for the days past the due date. Of 
course, there's also a final payment date beyond which you'll incur addi- 
tional financial penalties. We won't take this into account in our model, 
but if you currently incur this penalty on a loan, you can easily add the 
necessary extra column to keep track of it. 

We're also assuming that occasionally you'll find that the numbers 
we calculate and those the bank comes up with are slightly different. 
There are a number of possible reasons for this; the main one is late pay- 
ment. In addition, many banks calculate interest daily, whereas our 
model calculates it monthly. The figures obtained via the two methods 
can differ substantially over the long haul. 

So now we're ready to get started. Boot VisiCalc and let's begin. In 
B15, enter September, the first month of our loan. In B16 through B26, 
enter the remaining months, October through August. Enter the column 
headings as shown in figure 1. 

Before going any further, enter /GCM in order to make recalcula- 
tions happen only when we ask for them (by pressing !). This will make 
entering the remainder of the model less time-consuming. Since the ma- 
jority of the template will concern dollars and cents, enter /GF$ so that 
any values will automatically be displayed with two decimals. If there 
are any values you'd like displayed in some format other than this, use 
the format command /F to select the appropriate option. 

Enter the loan amount, $15000, in CI 5. Next, enter $505.41, the 
monthly payment, in D15. In a future column we'll look at a couple of 
methods of determining the payment amount using VisiCalc and Visi- 
Calc Advanced Version. 

In El 5, calculate the monthly amount to be applied to the interest ex- 
pense. If you know the interest rate, the solution is simple. Suppose you 
don't? It's still simple — let's determine it. 

We'll choose cell K15, in an area outside the template, as our work 
area. We could call this area our "variables" and/or "entry" section. In

addition to entering tiie interest rate here, we could enter the loan 
amount, number of periods, and so on in this section and then insert that 
information into the template automatically. 

To determine the monthly interest rate we need only know the prin- 
cipal balance and the monthly interest amount. Dividing the interest 
amount by the principal gives us the interest rate. You've already en- 
tered the principal into cell CI 5; now enter the interest amount in El 5. 
Then compute the monthly interest rate in cell K15 by entering 
-I-E15/C15. If you want to know the yearly rate, multiply the entry in 
cell K15 by 12. 

If the rate you already know is the yearly rate, calculating the month- 
ly rate is simply a matter of dividing 12 into it (for example, .1775/12 
[return]) in cell KI5. We'll need this value in order to calculate interest 
expense. 

Now all we have to do is to calculate how much of the monthly pay- 
ment is applied to the principal. In FI5, enter +DI5-EI5, the payment 
minus the interest amount. 

Let's reserve column G as a place to enter any additional payments 



you may make. Column H will contain a total of the payments made 
during the month; we'll use this total later, In HIS, enter +DI5+G15. 

Big Deal. You may be wondering what we've accomplished. So far, 
you've made most of the entries manually and only a couple of com- 
putations have been made by Vi.siCalc. Now, though, we're going to 
complete the model in such a way that it will automatically fill in the en- 
tries in all of the columns for the remainder of your loan. Ihe only 
changes that will be necessary from this month forward are those that 
must be made to reflect additional payment entries in column G and pos- 
sible corrections to the principal amount. 

Time to think about the October entries. Since we want the remain- 
ing entries to be calculated automatically, let's consider each column. 
The balance, calculated in column C, is easy. It should be the balance 
from the prior month, minus the amount of the prior month's payment 
applied to the principal, minus the amount of any extra payments. The 
formula in CI6 would be +CI5-FI5-G15. If you allow a row for each 
month in your loan contract, everything will work out fine. But if you 
pay off the loan early — by making additional early payments, for exam-

pie — you'll have a number of months when the values in column C will 
be incorrect. And, ideally, the balance in column C should show 0 once 
the loan is paid off. 

Now we have a puzzle. How do you have the template calculate the 
current amount of the principal and then make it display 0 once the 
loan is paid off? Regular readers should have no problem with this one. 
The answer is the (5jIF function. Before reading the next paragraph, try 
to figure out how to set things up. 

The @IF function takes the following form: If a logical statement is 
true, return the first value. If the statement is false, return the second 
value. The logical statement is nothing more than a comparison — you 
compare two values, cells, formulas, or combinations of these items us- 
ing the logical operators greater than (>), less than (<), equal to ( = ), 
greater than or equal to (> = ) less than or equal to (< = ), or not equal to 
(<>). The comparison then returns either TRUE or FALSE, and that 
determines whether the first or second value is displayed. 

Back to our problem. We want the value (in this case, the value of the 
principal of our loan) to be displayed if it is larger than 0; otherwise, we 
want a 0 to be displayed. That sounds simple enough. The value is 
-hCl 5— Fl 5— Gl 5. So the formula in C16 should read: 

@IF ((C15-F15-G15) > 0,C15-F15-G15,0) ^ 

Now replicate this formula down column C using relative for each 
cell reference. Of course, you'll want to determine the total number of 
payments on your own loan and replicate down the appropriate number 
of rows. For purposes of example, we'll stick with a single year's pay- 
ments. 

Now let's think about column D, the payment. One way to go would 
be to replicate the initial payment in D15 down the column. That would 
solve our problem, all right, but it wouldn't be the most elegant solution. 
It makes sense to have the last payment entry refiect what the real pay- 
ment needs to be. It's rarely the amount of the regular payment, espe- 
cially if you've incurred any additional penalties or made additional pay- 
ments. Besides, it would be nice to have the payment cell display a 0 
when no payment is necessary. That presents us with another puzzle. 
How do we make this column display the correct payment 
amount (which may be less than the regular payment amount)? Most of 
the time, the column should display the regular payment, but the amount 
due in the last month will probably be less than the other payments and 
will be 0 thereafter. Why not experiment with this one before reading the 
answer that follows. 

Since we're going to display optional values, the @IF statement is 
again the obvious choice. @1F is not the only choice, however. You 
might try some other options, such as ©LOOKUP. In this example, we'll 
stick with @IF. 

Let's think about the solution a moment. What do we know? Well, 
for one thing, we know the normal payment amount. We also know that 
the final payment will be the balance plus the amount of interest due in 
the final month. We could let the @IF formula calculate the amount as 
defined above; if we did that, we'd also have to ensure that the payment 
and interest became 0 just as soon as the loan was paid off. To state our 
solution in English: If the balance is greater than our payment, display 



the payment. If it is not, display the amount of the final payment (bal- 
ance plus interest). If there's no balance, then there will be no interest due 
and the cell will display a 0. 

Rather than entering the actual payment amount in the formula, 
we've referenced a specific cell in the variables section (K16, for 
example). Setting the template up that way means that you'd only have 
to change the actual payment amount in that one location for any future 
loans you want to calculate. 

The formula in cell DI6 should read: 

@IF(C15>K16,K16,C15 + E15) 

Replicate that formula into column D through row 26. With the 
exception of the payment amount, all cell references are relative. Be- 
cause the payment amount value is in a single cell, its reference would be 
no change. 

Calculating the interest for each month isn't hard at all. We've 
already determined the interest rate. Now we just multiply the monthly 
interest rate by the principal to determine the interest expense. The 
formula for E16 would be -l-C16*K15. Rephcate using relative reference 
and then no change reference. 

Next we must determine how much of the regular monthly payment 
is applied to the principal. Replicate F15 through column F using rela- 
tive reference. 

We've now completed the major part of the model. We can get a little 
better understanding of the mechanics involved by totaling some of the 
columns. For example, you'd probably like sums of the individual 
monthly payments, the interest expense, the extra payments, and the 
total payments. Enter the appropriate ©SUM formulas (©SUM D15 
. . . D27) in row 28. 

From these sums we can calculate such things as the effective interest 
rate. Choose a cell located below the actual model (for example, H32) 
and enter -I-E28/H28. The resulting figure is the effective interest rate for 
your loan. No matter what the "official" rate was, this tells you what you 
actually paid. If you make additional loan payments each month, you'll 
find that your effective interest rate is less than the official rate. 

Figure 2 shows the completed template. 

Now that your template is complete, you can look at each loan you 
have and do some rather precise calculations about what each loan is ac- 
tually costing you and what you can do to make it cost less. For ex- 
ample, you can do "what-ifs," such as adding a payment to each month 
to see how quickly you can pay off the loan; you can then determine how 
much interest expense you would save if you were to pay off the loan 
more rapidly. 

One additional note. Making an early payment one month may 
cause your next month's statement to show your payment due to be low- 
er than normal. It may be that you'll have to submit extra payments di- 
rectly to the bank in order to have them applied directly to the principal 
rather than incorporated into the normal payment cycle. 

There's another financial function worth knowing about that's in- 
cluded in VisiCalc but rarely used. It's the @NPV function, and it can tell 
you what a loan actually costs you in today's dollars. Net present value 
measures the present value (what the same money would buy in the value

of today's dollars) of a cash flow (payments). In cell H30, enter 
@NPV(K I8,I5...H26), where K18 is a cell in which you've entered your 
estimate for the rate of inflation. Then save your file and let's discuss a 
problem in our template. 

Problems, Problems, Problems. If you clear your file and then re- 
load it, you may find that a number of recalculations are required before 
the template is correct. For example, if you enter $1700 as the loan 
amount and .01 as the interest rate, save, and then reload the file, you'll 
find that approximately eighteen recalculations are required before the 
template is correct. This is so because the order of recalculation is by col- 
umn. Recalculation by column means that VisiCalc recalculates column 
A before column B, column B before column C, and so on. Because our 
template references back and forth between columns, there are times 
when a reference won't be correct until the next recalculation allows it to 
"see" the correct answer in another column. The solution to this poten- 
tial problem is to set the recalculation order to recalculate by rows 
(/GOR). Using the same information, the reloaded template will require 
approximately seven recalculations. 

If you wish to minimize the number of recalculations, you need to lay 
out your template so that all references are to cells either to the left of or 
above the original eel' When things are set up that way, all cells will be 
recalculated in an order that ensures the accuracy of the previous cell. 
Having paid attention to how you lay out a template will make a differ- 
ence not only when you're loading a file but also when you're doing 
"what-if analysis. If you have a large template that requires thirty to 
forty seconds to recalculate and you have to recalculate it ten times in or- 
der to ensure its accuracy, you'll have to wait more than five minutes 
each time you change a variable. 

If minimizing recalculation time is important and your report for- 
mat is not one that can be set up to accomplish that, you might want to 
make use of a format that incorporates both a computational section and 
a report section. The computational section is laid out to minimize the 
need for recalculation, and the report section displays the results in an at- 
tractive format. 

It is always important that you test each template under various con-

ditions in order to determine how many recalculations are necessary for 
accuracy. It's not always sufficient to assume that just because you've 
seen no changes for the last couple of recalculations the template must be 
accurate. This is especially important to remember when you have a tem- 
plate in which lots of computations take place in an area larger than the 
display screen. Sometimes it takes a number of recalculations before the 
area within the display is affected. 

Once you know how many recalculations are required to ensure ac- 
curacy, it would be nice to be able to count them as they take place. The 
Apple III uses a type-ahead buffer, which means you can press ! as many 
times as necessary and then wait for the results. (Pressing control-6 on 
the keypad to turn off the Apple III display will speed recalculation.) 
Folks with Apple lis can't use that trick, so let's see if we can find 
another way to go. 

The answer is simple, and it points out another problem you can en- 
counter when using VisiCalc. The problem, which the VisiCalc manual 
recommends that you avoid, is called circular referencing. 

Circular referencing, at its simplest, is when two cells reference one 
another. When true circular referencing is going on, both cells will con- 
tinue to generate new values each time you recalculate. This will keep 
happening until the values are either too small or too large for VisiCalc 
to display. 

Let's create and look at an example of circular referencing. In cell B 1 , 
enter I+Cl. In cell CI, enter -FBI. Press ! a number of times and then 
watch what happens. The values will continue to increase until they be- 
come so large that VisiCalc is no longer able to display them. Fortunate- 
ly, we can use this anomaly in creating a way of counting the number of 
recalculafions that have been made in a template. 

One way of arranging matters so that you'd know how many recal- 
culations have taken place would be to enter these formulas each time 
before you begin recalculating and then watch the results. But remem- 
ber, we'd like for this option to be reusable. We'd also like to be able to 
watch a value increment at each recalculation and to be able to reset the 
value to 0. We could just watch the value increment forever, renewing the 
counting with the current value when we wanted to evaluate the results. 
But it would be nice to have the count start at 1 each time we begin re- 
calculating. The problem is that we must enter the formula each time we 
load the template: if it already exists in the template being loaded, both 
cells will display ERROR and nothing we can do will change that. 

Before you continue, see if you can come up with a final solution. 

We know the initial premise of our solution — we're going to use cir- 
cular referencing. The formulas we enter in Bl and CI incremented the 
values each time we pressed !, so they're a good place to start. The ques- 
tion is, how do we get the values to zero on demand? 

Since the circular reference is, by definition, a closed loop, we're 
going to have to find a way to reset the loop to 0. This method should 
not involve an entry to either of the original cells; so we must use a third 
cell as a trigger. The problem might be stated thus: If there is no value in 
our trigger cell, then add 1 to the value in the other cell (CI); otherwise, 
display 0. 

Sounds like an %\¥ solution, doesn't it? Figure 3 shows the formulas 
as they are in each cell. 



Figure 3. 



Entering any value greater than 0 in cell Al causes cell Bl to display 
the value 0. In this case, CI will also display 0. Blanking cell Al allows 
the formulas to begin incrementing values at each recalculation — our 
solution! 

As you can see, the logic and search functions are part of what makes 
VisiCalc as powerful as it is. The more you experiment with them, the 
more useful these functions become. 

Next Month. In October's installment, we'll look at some enhance- 
ments to this template and at some noteworthy features of VisiCalc Ad- 
mnced Version.

Darth Vader himself was stalking off the cover of So/talk #1 three 
years ago this month. Included in that first, skinny, twenty-eight-page is- 
sue was an article entitled, "Dealing with DOS from Assembly Lan- 
guage." Since assembly language is a force that wasn't with most of us 
three years ago, we're about to discuss the DOS-from-assembly-lan- 
guage problem again. 

Already the eyes of many Basic-only readers are beginning to 
glaze over. Wait! This column is written with you in mind. Even if you 
never write assembly language programs, you frequently use them. Some 
of the ones you use will fail to work at times. 

The correct procedures for using DOS from assembly language 
aren't well documented. Many assembly language programs, even com- 
mercial ones, have problems using DOS under certain conditions. Users 
who understand the symptoms of these problems and the limitations 
they imply can often find a cure. 

Here are a few assembly language fundamentals that will help you 
with this column and with other material you may encounter. 

A Silicon Primer. Machine language is the only language your Ap- 
ple's microprocessor can actually understand. Machine language con- 
sists entirely of numbers. Bare-handed humans find machine language 
exceedingly difficult to read or write. 

Assembly language is the human version of machine language. An as- 
sembler is software a human can use as a tool for writing machine lan- 
guage programs with words instead of numbers. An assembler trans- 
lates words into the numbers required by the microprocessor. 

Machine language and assembly language are really two manifesta- 
tions of the same thing. The human-readable manifestation of a pro- 
gram is often called source code. Object code is the machine-readable 
manifestation. The process of converting source code to object code is 
called assembling the program. 

The microprocessor in the Apple is known as the 6502. It, like all mi- 
croprocessors, has its own unique machine language. Programs written 
for the 6502 will not run on computers with other microprocessors, such 
as the Z-80 (used in CP/M-compatible computers) or the 8088 (used in 
the IBM pc and compatibles). 

There are only fifty-six things you can actually get the microproces- 
sor in an Apple to do. Most of these are available in several different 
styles, however, so 6502 machine language has about one hundred fifty 
distinct commands. 

The 6502 contains a handful of its own memory locations. These are 
called registers. One of these, known as the accumulator, is the only mem- 
ory location in the entire computer where two numbers can be added or 
subtracted. 

Amazingly, direct multiplication and division are beyond the capa- 
bility of the 6502. Such high-level calculations as two times two are done 
with subroutines that repeatedly add or subtract. 

Writing programs in assembly language is a slow and tedious proc- 



ess. Nonetheless, assembly language provides a flexibility, a level of con- 
trol, and an execution speed simply unattainable in any other language. 
And once a programmer has built up a library of standard, tested sub- 
routines, programming becomes easier and faster. 

Assembly language programs are always closely identified with their 
actual location in memory. Programs are said to reside at such and such 
an address. 

Some assembly language programs, but not many, are relocatable. 
This means they will work just fine no matter where they reside. Others, 
even rarer, are self-relocating. This means that they automatically adjust 
themselves for whatever location they end up in. A DOS master disk 
contains a self-relocating version of DOS. 

A DOS slave disk, on the other hand, contains a nonrelocatable ver- 
sion of DOS. Most assembly language programs are like this. It means 
they don't work correctly if moved. 

For example, suppose a program contains a text string. The pro- 
gram reads this string using the address the string was assigned to when 
the program was assembled. But if the program is moved, the string will 
be moved along with it and consequently won't be where it's supposed to 
be. Instead, the program will read whatever junk is at the correct ad- 
dress and fail. This is just one example of the kinds of problems that de- 
velop when assembly language programs are moved. 

E.T. Call Home. There is an assembly language subroutine perma- 
nently nailed into the Monitor — part of the Apple's built-in software — 
that will clear your Apple's screen. You can run this routine from Basic 
by using the call command. A Basic call is the same thing as a gosub, ex- 
cept control is passed to an assembly language, rather than a Basic, 
subroutine. 

The clear-screen subroutine starts at memory byte 64600. You can 
access this routine from Applesoft with the command call 64600. (How- 
ever, it is usually written as call —936. The two numbers 64600 and -936 
represent the same memory byte. Call -936 is easier to remember and 
works in Integer Basic as well as Applesoft. This explains its popularity.) 

The assembly language statements for doing the equivalent call look 
like this: 

HOME EQU 64600 ;set HOME equal to 64600 
JSR HOME ;jump to subroutine at the 

; address indicated by HOME 

The first statement sets the word HOME to the proper address. 
(HOME is the standard name for this address — see the Monitor ROM 
source code, which is included in the Apple II reference manual.) The sec- 
ond statement calls the Monitor routine. The first statement would ap- 
pear only once in a program. The second, of course, could appear wher- 
ever and as many times as the programmer desired. 

In machine language, the equivalent call looks like this:

These three numbers are in hexadecimal. Hexadecimal numbers are 
very similar to decimal, except each digit can range from 0 to 15 instead 
of 0 to 9. The letters A through F are used to represent the digits for 10 
through 15. 

The number 64600 in hexadecimal is $FCFK (the dollar sign indi- 
cates the number is in hexadecimal). 

In our machine language in.struction, 20 is the hexadecimal code for 
JSR, jump to subroutine. Notice that the address $FCF8 follows, only 
it's backward. This is standard operating procedure in 6502 machine lan- 
guage. 

Apple DOS is written in assembly language. You might suppose that 
would make DOS extremely simple for other assembly language pro- 
grams to use. . . . 

Bone of Basic's Bone; Flesh of Basic's Flesh. Last month it was ob- 
served that Apple DOS sometimes seems to have been created from one 
of Basic's ribs. In that column we looked at all the DOS commands that 
have special features for Basic's sake. 

In columns previous to last month's we saw that Apple DOS is really 
made up of three separate programs. RWTS, one of these three, is the 
program that actually turns the disk drive on, moves the arm inside it, 
and reads and writes on disk. Using RWTS, an assembly language pro- 
grammer can gain direct and easy access to individual sectors on a disk. 
The techniques for this have been well documented, both in this column 
(in its prior incarnation: October 1982) and elsewhere (D 05 Manual, Be- 
neath Apple DOS). 

Being able to handle individual sectors, however, is a far shot from 
being able to deal with a whole file. The program within DOS that facili- 
tates file handling is called the file manager. 

The file manager is in charge of the clerical aspects of retrieving the 
files a programmer asks for, stowing away the files a programmer saves, 
and keeping track of where everything on each disk is. The procedures 
for using the file manager directly from assembly language are not at all 
well documented anywhere but in the book Beneath Apple DOS, al- 
though they are very similar to the RWTS procedures. 

To use either RWTS or the file manager, a programmer must fill in a 



table of numbers with meaningful values. The table a.ssociated with 
RWTS is called the input /output control block or I OB. The table asso- 
ciated with the file manager is called {ha file manaf>er parameter list or, 
rarely, the status area. 

For example, to use RWTS directly, you have to fill in the I OB to m- 
dicate the slot, drive, volume, track, and .sector numbers of the particu- 
lar sector you are interested in. Another number in the lOB indicates 
whether you want to read the sector or write to it. After filling in the ta- 
ble with these and other numbers, you simply call on RWTS. 

The file manager is the primary user of the RWTS routine. Every 
time you do a catalog, for example, it is the file manager that tells 
RWTS which sectors on your disk to read. The file manager also dis- 
plays the catalog on your screen. 

The primary user of the file manager, on the other hand, is the third 
program inside DOS, the DOS command interpreter — affectionately 
known in this column as the Captain. 

It is the Captain that is bone of Basic's bone, fiesh of Basic's flesh, 
RWTS and the file manager are oblivious to what language is calling 
them. They are easy to use from assembly language (or from Basic, for 
that matter) once a programmer knows how to fill in the tables. The 
Captain, on the other hand, being a creature created as a helpmate for 
Basic, is more difficult to tame. 

Nonetheless, beginning assembly language programmers have their 
hands and minds quite full of new concepts. Wouldn't it be great if they 
could use the DOS commands they already knew from their experience 
with Basic? Why burden them further by forcing them to learn new ways 
of dealing with disks and files at the same time they are fighting to un- 
derstand indirect indexed addressing? 

Tell It to the Captain. Fortunately, even the Captain has remark- 
able adaptability running through his veins. As discussed in previous 
columns, the Captain is a spylike creature who taps all the messages 
coming from your keyboard or going to your screen so he can see them 
first. This is how he intercepts commands meant for him. 

Because he opens all your mail, you can give DOS commands to the 
Captain by simply sending them to your screen. The Captain will inter-

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? 

Are you tired of waiting for DOS to load and save 
files? Are you tired of waiting for DOS to finish so 
you can type again? Are you tired of waiting for 
your printer? When you buy DIVERSI-DOS'", 
by Bill Basham, you won't have to wait any more! 
Here's why: 

1. DOS speed-up: Apple DOS 3.3 takes 18 disk 
revolutions to read a single track, whereas 
DIVERSI-DOS reads or writes a track in just 2 
revolutions. This speeds up file processing 
tremendously (see table). 

2. Keyboard Buffer: DIVERSI-DOS allows you 
to type ahead, as fast as you can, without missing 
a single character. 

3. Print Buffer: DIVERSI-DOS can use a RAM 

card (16K-128K) to temporarily save characters 
before they are printed. Thus, your computer 
won't have to wait for your printer to finish. 

4. DDMOVER: DIVERSI-DOS can now be 

moved to a RAM card to increase the available 
memory in a BASIC program. 
DIVERSI-DOS, the QUADRUPLE utility, 
requires a 48K Apple II, 11+ or //e with DOS 3.3. A 
simple, menu driven installation program is 
included on the un protected disk. So what are 
you waiting for?

cept and execute them. This technique works from any language, includ- 
ing assembly language. And the beauty is that the commands are the 
same ones we already use with Applesoft and Integer Basic. 

But there are a few problems with this approach. The family rela- 
tionship between DOS and Basic does get in the way. There are three 
areas where problems develop. 

First, the Captain does some things in different ways, depending on 
whether Basic is running a program or is stopped. To get the Captain to 
work normally, an assembly language program must let him know a pro- 
gram is running. This requires some special tricks. 

Second, the Captain normally returns program control to Basic af- 
ter a disk error or a press of the reset key. Since you don't want users 
thrown out of your program and into Basic every time they leave a disk 
drive door open, a second trick is necessary. 

Finally, the Captain and Basic have an agreed-upon procedure for 
keeping track of what memory areas inside the Apple are available for 
use. Assembly language programmers should honor this agreement but 
often don't know how. 

Crossing the (Toll) Bridge. There is one price that must be paid for 
tricking the Captain. You have to find him. As we've seen before, DOS 
doesn't have a permanent home. While DOS can usually be found at the 
standard 48K location, some users like to move DOS into a 16K RAM 
card. 

It's true that DOS always files a change-of-address notice when it is 
booted. This notice can be found in the page three vector table, which we 
discussed in June. By using the page three vector table, you can call both 
RWTS and the file manager without knowing where DOS resides. 

The page three vector table can also be used to find the Captain. But 
many assembly language programs don't use it. Instead they simply as- 
sume DOS is at its normal 48K location. This causes users unnecessary 
problems. 

As a user, you should be aware that many assembly language pro- 
grams won't work correctly if DOS has been moved to the lan- 
guage card. 

At the very least, a commercial program should check the page three

vector table and refuse to run if EXDS isn't at its normal 48K location. A 
really good program will find the Captain no matter where he is hidden. 

Of course, if you are using programs you have written yourself or if 
you are using copy-protected commercial software, the DOS location is 
under control and shouldn't cause a problem. 

The reason it's so important to find the Captain is that he keeps some 
information in his heart that we must have access to. This information is 
kept in two areas, the Basic entry-point vector table and the active-Basic 
flag. (It would have been nice if these had been made part of the page 
three vector table, but. . . .) 

Finding Himem. The active-Basic flag tells us which version of Basic 
the Captain thinks is running. In normal 48K DOS, this flag is at byte 
43702 ($AAB6). A zero at this location indicates Integer Basic, a 64 ($40) 
indicates standard Applesoft, and 128 ($80) indicates cassette Applesoft. 

Once we know which Basic the Captain thinks is running, it is a very 
easy matter to find the extent of free memory. Nonetheless, few assem- 
bly language programs do it. Even though it is quite common for pro- 
grams to be inserted between DOS and its buffers, thus decreasing the 
amount of free space available, many assembly language programs as- 
sume this hasn't been done. 

Consequently, such programs overwrite the DOS buffers and cause 
users misery. At the very least, commercial programs should check 
himem and refuse to run if the value there is abnormal. A really good 
program will adapt to any himem setting. 

Basic keeps the lowest available address, lomem, and the highest 
available address, himem, stored on page zero. The Captain updates hi- 
mem whenever he rebuilds the DOS buffers. The actual zero-page loca- 
tions vary according to which language is active, as shown. 

lomem himem 
Integer 74-75 ($4A-4B) 76-77 ($4C-4D) 

Applesoft 103-104 ($67-68) 115-116 ($73-74) 

The active-Basic flag also has some other uses, which we'll get to in a 
moment. 

Intercepting Errors. The Basic entry-point vector table is a list of ad- 
dresses DOS uses to pass control of the computer to Basic. This happens 
during cold starts, warm starts, when a program is run, and after a DOS 
error. 

A DOS/ Basic warm start occurs whenever the reset key is pressed, 
unless you intercept the reset at the soft-entry vector in the page three 
vector table. Rather than mess with the soft-entry vector, however, you 
can simply place your assembly language program's warm-start address 
in the Basic entry-point vector table. Then the Captain will pass control 
to you after a reset, rather than to Basic. 

This same technique is used to get him to pass control back after a 
DOS error. Put the address of your error-handling routine at byte 40282 
($9D5A). Put your warm-start address at byte 40286 ($9D5E). 

As part of your error-handling routine you can choose whether you 
want the Captain to send DOS error messages before passing control 
back to you. If you would like the Captain to do this for you, it is very 
important that you store a zero in byte 216 ($D8). This is the Applesoft 
onerr flag. If it contains a value greater than 128, the Captain will not 
send error messages. Again, many assembly language programs fail to 
clear this byte. If you have a favorite program that sometimes doesn't 
send DOS error messages, simply set byte 216 to zero before running the 
program. 

If, on the other hand, a programmer wants to handle DOS errors 
within an assembly language program, two steps are necessary. Not only 
must byte 216 be set higher than 128, but the acdve-Basic flag must also 
indicate Applesoft is running. If the Captain thinks Integer Basic is run- 
ning, he always sends error messages. 

There is nothing complex about changing the active-Basic flag; just 
do it. Put a 64 ($40) there to indicate Applesoft. You would probably 
also like to know how you can determine which DOS error occurred. 
The Captain puts the error number in the X register just before passing 
control to your error-handling routine. This number will be one of the 
standard error numbers documented in the DOS manual. 

Tell Him We're Running. The final trick an assembly language pro- 
grammer has to play on the Captain is to make him think a Basic pro- 
gram is running. This is necessary to avoid the not direct command error

when handling text files. It's also necessary for intercepting DOS errors. 
And it even keeps keyboard input from accidentally activating DOS 
commands. 

The keyboard input problem is an interesting one. If an assembly lan- 
guage program fails to tell the Captain it is running, he continues to in- 
tercept all keyboard input and look for DOS commands. If a user enters 
his last time in response to a program prompt, and his name is "RUN- 
YAN", DOS will immediately try to run a Basic program called Yan. 
The results are a disaster. 

To avoid all this, the assembly language program needs to set three 
flag bytes on the Apple's zero page. There are many different ways to do 
this. Here's how Apple's FID program does it: 



0844 
0846 
0848 
084A 



A9 80 LDA #$80 

85 76 STA $76 

85 D9 STA $D9 

85 33 STA $33 



load accumulator with hex value $80 

store contents of A ($80) 
at the three zero-page 
locations $76, $D9, and $33 



Two of these locations are Applesoft flags; one, $D9, is an Integer 
flag. Of course, it's only necessary to set the flags for the version of Basic 
that DOS thinks is running, but setting all three is pretty simple. 

A few of you might like to know that the routine inside DOS that ac- 
tually checks whether a program is running resides at byte 42590 
($A65E-A678). If this routine returns with the carry (a flag inside the 
microprocessor itselO clear, the Captain will think a program is running. 

Your Mother Does Not Work Here — Please Pick Up after Your- 
self. Any assembly language program that uses the techniques men- 
tioned here modifies DOS. When the program is finished, it should put 
everything back the way it was originally. This can be done quite simply 
by exiting through the DOS cold-start vector in the page three table. 

If you use a program that works well but leaves you and your com- 
puter in a muddle, a DOS cold start via call 979 will sometimes fix things. 
Unfortunately, some programs change the reference tables that the Cap- 
tain transfers into the Basic entry-point table, as well as the entry-point ta- 
ble itself. If the reference tables have been changed, the only way to re- 
cover is to reboot. 



In some situations an assembly language program is designed to 
work as a subroutine. Once it is finished it needs to return from whence it 
came rather than jumping to the DOS cold-start address. 

There are some problems programmers need to be aware of in this 
situation. If the program is bloaded and called, simply bandaging any 
DOS patches the program makes is all that is required before its return 
(RTS in assembly language). In addition, if the program doesn't require 
any input and doesn't send any output, simply unmodifying any DOS 
modifications will be sufficient. 

Brun and Back. If the program is brun, and if input /output opera- 
tions are necessary (including the sending of DOS commands), the pro- 
gram should retrieve whatever is stored at byte 43609 ($AA59) before in- 
put/output and replace it before returning. This value is critical to your 
program's finding its way home again but gets changed whenever the 
Captain intercepts a character passing through the I/O links. 

Alternatively, you could disconnect DOS from the I /O links. In this 
ca.se, you should reconnect it by calling the page three vector at 1002 
($3EiA) before returning. In either case, of course, you have to be sure 
your program exits with the stack pointer where it was on entrance. 

A similar problem arises when you intercept DOS errors yourself, 
but then try to use the Captain's routines for sending selected error mes- 
sages. If you want to do this, first disconnect DOS. Then put the error 
number in the accumulator and jump to 42706 (SA6D2). The Captain 
will send the message, then send control back to the start of your error- 
handling routine. You will have to meet him there or you will get an infi- 
nite cycle of error messages. 

The easiest way to disconnect DOS is by using the Monitor routines 
Inport and Outport. Load the accumulator with the slot you want to use 
and call 65163 ($FE8B) for inport (equivalent to Basic's in#), or 65173 
($FE95) for outport (pr#). 

Assembly language programmers who follow these procedures when 
using DOS will create few problems for the rest of us. 

Another slick way to use DOS from assembly language, or from Ba- 
sic, is to ignore the Captain entirely and send commands directly to the 
file manager. We'll get to that next month. See you then.

In this article, we're going to look at ways to use text page two and 
text pages three, four, five, and so on. You didn't i<now that there were 
more than two text pages, did you? Well, you're right, there aren't. We 
can, however, treat sections of memory as "phantom" text pages. We'll 
see how to use them to create interesting and useful effects in your 
programs. 

The Apple comes endowed with two text screens that can be 
displayed on the monitor screen. These two text pages are really just seg- 
ments of memory, and the thing that distinguishes them from other seg- 
ments of memory is the hardware that displays the contents as text char- 
acters. Text page one has the added distinction that it can be printed on. 
There's no provision in Applesoft for printing on page two. What use is a 
text screen you can't print on? Remember, it's just a section of memory. 
You can't print there, but you can move printed text there from else- 
where in memory. Page one, perhaps? 

This makes the second page much less flexible than the first, but it 



Location 3072, the new starting address of the program, must 
contain a zero or the computer gets confused. 

After doing these pokes, any program loaded or typed in will reside 
above location 3072. 

Big Caution: Don't do these pokes while a program is in memory. If 
you do, the program will be rendered useless. These pokes must be done 
before you load and run your program. The pokes won't affect the 
normal operation of the computer; they just reserve a little of the mem 
ory usually available to the program. Programs can be loaded, saved, 
and run just like normal. The loss of 1,024 bytes of memory is hardly 
noticeable in a 48K system. 

These pokes change the index to the start of the program without 
moving the program to the new location. Since that will ruin the pro- 
gram in memory, a short "loader" program is needed to perform the 
pokes and then run your main program. The short program listed below 
does the setup.

can still have its uses. For example, you can use the second text screen for 
a resident help screen, available for instant viewing at the touch of a key. 
You can use it to display codes used in the program. You're entering a 
payroll and have forgotten a deduction code. Help screen to the rescue. 

The best part about using page two to view the help screen is that 
page one is left untouched. When you finish with the help screen and 
return to your program, you are exactly where you left off. Even if 
you're in the middle of data entry, you could switch to the help screen 
while entering a string of letters and return to the same letter you left off 
at. The switch between page one and page two is superquick. 

The second text page resides directly above the first text page, 
occupying a range of memory from 2048 ($800) to 3071 ($BFF). 
Usually, Basic programs begin at location 2048 ($800) and use the text 
page two memory space. As a matter of fact, if you turn on page two 
(poke — 1 6299,0) while a program is in memory, you will see the begin- 
ning of your program through the eyes of text page two. 

In order to use the second page, we'll have to move the program out 
of the way. Two pokes before entering or loading the program take care 
of this. Location 104 stores the starting address of the program. By 
changing this number, the program can be made to start above text page 
two (or anywhere in memory), allowing you to use the second text page 
for any display you want. 

Location 104 stores the page number of the starting address. In this 
case we mean a memory page: an area of 256 bytes. The normal value ot 
location 104 is eight, indicating page eight. To find the actual starting ad- 
dress of the Basic program, multiply the page number by 256: 8 X 256 = 
2048. 

To use page two, the program must begin at address 3072, which is 
the start of page twelve (3072/256). These commands set the pointer to 
the correct location. 

POKE 104,12 

POKE 3072,0 



10 POKE 104,12 
20 POKE 3072,0 

30 PRINT CHR$(4);"RUN YOUR PROGRAM" 
To restore the normal program start address: 

10 POKE 104,8 
20 POKE 2048,0 

These pokes should not be done from within the main program 
either. The program would continue to execute until it reached a goto or 
gosub statement, at which point it would look in the wrong place for the 
start of the program and be unable to find itself. 

Now that we've made page two available for use, how do we create a 
page two display? As mentioned earlier, there are no output commands 
for page two. Page one has print, vtab, inverse, and many other com.- 
mands for setting up and printing a text display. 

The easiest way to create a page two screen is to create it on page one 
and move it to page two. There are two ways to do this. The first way is 
to bsave the screen you create on page one and then bload it onto page 
two. The second way is to use a memory move routine. Fortunately, the 
Apple Monitor has a memory move routine that can be called from a 
Basic program. We'll get into this method a bit later. 

This program creates a screen on page one and bsaves it.

Our examples so far have used a single, static page two screen. The 
help screen is loaded in and isn't changed during the program. Let's see 
how to create a dynamic help screen, one in which the screen can be 
changed during the program so that more information can be displayed. 

One way to do this is to store the regular text page in the page two 
area and then create your help screen on page one. When you're done 
with the help screen, the original screen can be moved back to page one. 
If you want, you can create a different help screen each time the help key 
is pressed. Using page one for our help screen gives us the advantage of 
letting the program create the help screen instead of loading a previously 
created screen into page two. 

Page one is moved into page two with the routine mentioned earlier. 
The routine consists of two instructions and a call to the Monitor's 
memory move routine. The code for it is below and is relocatable. The 
Monitor move routine is very quick and can move an entire page of text 
in a split second. This is the assembly program that sets up for and calls 
the move routine: 

0300- D8 OLD 

0301- AO 00 LDY #$00 
0303- 4C 2C FE JMP $FE2C 

Three things must be specified before the move routine can be called. 
You must specify the starting address of the block of memory you want 
moved, the ending address of the block of memory, and the destination 
address to move it to. To move page one into page two, the starting ad- 
dress would be 1024, the ending address 2047, and the destination ad- 
dress 2048. 

The following are two subroutines to be put into each program using 
a memory move to move text pages. They should be renumbered to con- 
venient locations within the program. The first subroutine pokes the 
memory move assembly routine into memory at $300. The second sub- 
routine takes care of poking the starting, ending, and destination ad- 
dresses into the proper locations so that the Monitor's memory move 
routine can get at them. 

This routine pokes in the instructions that call the memory move 
routine. It should be executed once as part of the program's initializa- 
tion process. 

10 REM * MEMORY MOVE POKER '

30 READ A 

40 POKE 768 + LOC.A 

50 NEXT 



60 DATA 216,160,0,76,44,254 
70 RETURN 

This is the subroutine that pokes the starting, ending, and destination ad- 
dresses into memory. Your program should use this routine whenever 
you want to move the contents of page one into page two. 

10 REM * MOVES TEXT PAGES 

20 BEG = 1024: REM * PAGE ONE 

30 FINISH = 2047 

40 DEST = 2048: REM * MOVE TO PAGE TWO

(FINISH / 256) 

80 POKE 66,DEST - INT (DEST / 256) * 256: POKE 67, INT (DEST / 
256) 

90 REM * CALL MEMORY MOVE ROUTINE 
100 CALL 768 

This shows how to prepare a page to be moved. The starting address of 
the page to be moved is poked into locations 60 and 61 by line 60. Line 
70 pokes the ending address into locations 62 and 63. Finally, line 80 
pokes the start address of the destination into locations 66 and 67. Line 
100 calls the routine that performs the memory move. 

This next program puts it all together. The program will use page one 
for a help screen while using page two to store the screen that was on 
page one. When the help screen is exited, the screen stored in page two is 
moved back into page one, thus restoring condifions to normal. The pro- 
gram works as follows: The memory move routine is poked into memory 
starting at location 768. The normal data-entry screen is set up and the 
user is prompted for input. 

W help is entered, the memory move routine is used to move the page 
one screen to page two, freeing page one to be used for the help screen. 
The help screen is created, and a get statement is used to hold the screen 
until any key is pressed. At that point, the original screen is moved from 
page two back into page one. This happens so fast that it appears instan- 
taneous.

Since the help saeen is created on page one with print statements, it 
isn't as fast as the switch bacic. If a cleaner look is desired, a slight 
modification will do the trick. After page one is moved to page two, turn 
on page two while the help screen is being created on page one. After the 
help screen is created, turn on page one to display it. To return to the 
regular display, turn on page two again and then move page two into 
page one (page two is left intact). When page two has been moved, turn 
on page one and you'll be back where you were. With this method, the 
screens flip cleanly in and out. 

Now let's move into even more screen moving, using five screens. To 
use the phantom text pages, we have to start the program at even higher 
locations in memory. 

The accompanying table shows how to reserve memory for as many 
as ten text pages. It shows you what to poke for whatever pages you want 
to use. If you want to use text pages one, two, three, and four, for 
example, you would poke 104,20 and poke 5120,0.

PEAKING 





"The continuing saga o/Softalk articles versus the computer has not ended," 
Mark Pelczarski said in his most recent letter, speaking of the printer and disk drive 
that went on strike as soon as they saw him getting ready to work on the book of his 
Graphically Speaking columns. He was referring also to the time the computer went 
on the blink in the middle of a late column, the time he handwrote the column while 
boating on vacation and the one that got away took the fragile papers with it. the time 
he finally got three months ahead and the hard disk failed and killed all three 
columns. 

Little did Pelczarski know. Even darker forces were at work. 

"This is odd," said the editor during a Wizardry break. " Pelczarski hasn't put a 
signoff in his last column. This is his last column, isn't it?" 

"Yes," mumbled the associate editor through her granola bar. "The new one 
starts in September." 

But it wasn't. Just as the printers finished printing the August issue with the edi- 
tor's makeshift signoff for Pelczarski, Pelczarski's final manuscript arrived at Sof- 
talk, complete with his own signoff. 

And his signoff s a lot better than ours. 

We've talked about the various Applesoft commands available for 
drawing on the hi-res screen, but so far we've used the commands 
mostly for animation and "computed" pictures. Here's a program that 
makes use of all the Applesoft graphics commands for freehand drawing 
with paddles or a joystick. It gives you two line-drawing modes, color 
control (using the standard six Apple colors), and a paintbrush mode 
using a shape table. It also lets you save and load your pictures to and 
from disk. 

The program uses a few interesting programming tricks. A couple of 
them deal with refining joystick control for drawing, and one shows a 
quick way to poke in some hexadecimal machine-language code from 
Basic. It's also fairly short, so there's room for adding things like the 
packing and fill routines from earlier in the series. 

The two line-drawing modes are called line and fill. The latter is 
somewhat of a misnomer — it's not like the fill routine that appeared last 
February — but it does allow a sort of manual fill. The regular line mode 
puts two round cursors on the screen. One is a start point and the other 
the end point for your line. The start point is stationary. The end point 
moves under joystick control. When you push button 0 on the joystick, a 
line is drawn between the start point and end point and the end point be- 
comes the new start point. This way it is possible to draw successive lines, 
such as around a box, without having to move the start point manually 
each time. Pressing button 1 at any time moves the start point to the cur- 
rent end point position without drawing a line. 

The fill version of line mode works the same, except the start point 



doesn't change when you draw a line. The result is that, until you change 
the start point yourself (by pressing button 1), all lines originate from the 
same point. By holding down button 0 as you move the joystick, you can 
manually fill an area with any of the six colors available, albeit slowly. 

There is a shape table of three brush shapes numbered 1, 2, and 3. 
Number 1 is a small solid brush, number 3 is a larger solid brush, and 
number 2 is an "airbrush," made up of random dots in a small area. 
Brushes were discussed earlier when we talked about the Picdraw rou- 
tine from The Graphics Magician. That routine used a character gen- 
erator that allowed use of all the blended colors. The same technique can 
be used with a shape table, as in this program, except that you become 
limited to the standard six colors. 

A help page lists all the keypress options for the program and what 
they do. To make the command keys easier to remember, each key is the 
first letter of the function name. Help, for example, is H. Line and fill 
modes are selected with L and F. Among other options are the get and 
save commands (G and S) for loading and saving pictures to disk (L, for 
load, was already used for line mode). The escape key toggles between 
full-screen graphics and mixed text and graphics. C and B control the 
drawing and background colors, the latter clearing the screen when it sets 
the new background. 

Z is one of the joystick commands. It zeros in your joystick to the 
area immediately around the cursor. Pressing it again toggles back to 
full-screen control. 

Another feature of the program's joystick control is that it can han- 
dle the full range of X, from 0 to 279, even though the joystick only re- 
turns values from 0 to 255. This is done by adding an offset, XS, to the 
joysdck value each time through the loop. If you are working on the left 
nine-tenths of the screen, this offset is -5. This is n^ative, instead of zero, 
to compensate for joysticks that are slightly worn and don't go all the 
way down to zero. (Also for products such as the KoalaPad, which, al- 
though it's an interesting new graphics input device, has even less resolu- 
tion than a joystick.) When you are working on the right nine-tenths of 
the screen, the offset 30 is added to the joystick value, giving it a maxi- 
mum value of 285. All values are then put in actual range (0-279) be- 
fore drawing. You shouldn't notice this change in offsets unless you 
move your cursor from one extreme edge to the other. 

The following is a breakdown of the program sections for your refer- 
ence. You should also take a look at the accompanying list of variables 
used in the program.

Lines iO-100 initialize everything. 
Lines 105—190 display the help screen. 

Lines 195-205 print the current status (mode, colors) at the bottom 
of the drawing screen. 

Lines 210—228 read the paddle controls, zero in if in zero mode, ad- 
just X with XS, and check the coordinates for proper range. 

Lines 230 and 232 flash the cursors (the start point only if needed). 
Note that in line 232, the statement if not PS means to us "if not in paint- 
brush mode." To the computer, if no! PS is equivalent to saying if PS = 
0. If PS is the same as the statement ifPSOO, or, "if PS is not equal to 
zero," or, in our case, "if PS is 1." This logic syntax is used in several 
places in the program, and it does save a lot of bytes in long programs. 

Line 233 draws the brush if in paintbrush mode and the brush is 
down. 

Lines 235—285 check for a keypress and process the keypress after 
erasing the flashing cursors. 

Lines 290-330 erase the flashing cursors, check for a button press, 
and process any button press. 

Lines 400— 504 let the user input a new drawing or background color. 

Line 750 is a disk error message. 

Lines 850—855 turn off the paintbrush switches, if necessary, if one of 
the line modes is selected. Note that two shape tables are used, one for 
the flashing round cursor, the other for the brushes. Line 850 pokes the 
location of the round cursor into the shape table pointer (the second byte 
is zero for both tables, so it need not be changed). Line 266 has a similar 
poke for setting the brush shape table. 

Lines 900—970 let you save or load a picture. 

Lines 1000-1020 load the shape table data by setting the starting lo- 
cations, L, and calling the subroutine at 11(X). 

Lines 1 100—1 150 contain a routine that will read a string of charac- 
ter data and interpret that string as hexadecimal numbers (by using the 
ASCII code of each character). Once each number is interpreted, it is 
poked into memory, starting at location L. 

Lines 1200—1240 contain the hex data for our shape tables. Line 
1200 is the cursor shape table, and lines 1210—1240 contain the three 
brushes. How'd we get the data? Brute force . . . sorry. It seemed the sim- 
plest way to do it in an Applesoft program without having to mess with 
bloading binary files. The original bloaded shapes were made with the 
Shape Maker program, but if we printed that data here it would not 
make for very meaningful typing. 

With this issue I sign off from Graphically Speaking to let someone 
else start from the beginning. I do this partially to avoid getting into sub- 
ject matter that might be construed as conflict of interest, and partly to 
let someone else pick up at the beginning again. I don't feel I should be in 
a position to compare graphics utilities on the market, and the direction 
of the column can either go that way, become more technical, or start 
from the beginning for all the newer readers. The fellow who's taking 
over should do all right (anyone who walks around the West Coast

i Rana^ disk drive was 
twice as good as Apple's 
i witli one liead. 




Now we liave two. 





We added another head 
so you won't have to buy another disk. 

That's the beauty of a double sided head. A 
floppy disk which allows you to read and write on 
both sides. For more storage, for more information, 

for keeping larger records, 
and for improved perfor- 
mance of your system. 
That's what our new Elite 
Two and Elite Three offers. 
It's the first double headed 
Apple® compatible disk 
drive in the industry. And of 
course, the technology is 
from Rana. We're the com- 
pany who gave you 163K 
bytes of storage with our Elite One, a 14% increase 
over Apple's. And now with our high tech double 
sided heads, our Elite Two and Three offers you two 
to four times more storage than Apple's. That's 
really taking a byte out of the competition. 

We put our heads together 
to give you a superior disii drive. 

We designed the Elite Three to give you near 
hard disk capacity with all the advantages of a 
minifloppy system. The double sided head oper- 
ates on 80 tracks per side, giving you a capacity of 
652K bytes. It would take 4y2 Apples to give you 
that. And cost you three times our Elite Three's 
reasonable $849 pricetag. 



Rana s double sided heads give Apple 
II superior disk performance power 
than second generation personal com- 
puters such as IBM s. 



II takes 4V2 Apples to equal the capacity 
of our superior Elite Three. 





The Elite Two offers an impressive 326K bytes 
and 40 tracks on each side. This drive is making a 
real hit with users who need extra storage, but 
don't require top-of-the-line capacity Costwise, it 
takes 2y2 Apple drives to equal the performance of 
our Elite Two. And twice as many diskettes. Leave it 
to Rana to produce the most cost efficient disk 
drive in the world. 

We've always had the guts to be a leader. 

Our double sided head may be an industry 
first for Apple computers, but nobody was surprised.

Once upon a time, three blind men were 
led to an elephant so that they might experi- 
ence the nature of the beast. One man held the 
trunk in his hands and said, "The elephant is 
like a giant snake." Another man stood by one 
of the elephant's legs and, wrapping his arms 
around the leg, said, "Oh no; the elephant is 
strong and tall like a tree." The third man put 
his hands on the elephant's side and said, "No, 
this beast is like a great wall." 

Although you no doubt see the folly of their 
observations, we are all intellectually blind to 
greater and lesser degrees regarding the many 
things and subjects to be found in the world. On 
the nature of simple objects, like a table or a 
chair, we can pretty much agree; although those 
of greater experience, like a carpenter or cabi- 
netmaker, may have perceptions far more de- 
tailed than those of the average person. 

The more complex the subject, the more our 
views of its nature are likely to differ from other 
people's and the more our own personal ex- 
perience (or lack thereoO is apt to produce a 
view unique to ourselves — most likely a view 
blind to certain aspects of the thing in question. 

The Lisa computer, released last June by 
Apple Computer, definitely qualifies as a com- 
plex subject, and therefore it is unlikely that 
many people will fully appreciate or even un- 
derstand all about its nature and capabilities. 
This observation has a lot to do with the an- 
swer to one of the more often posed questions, 
"Is the Lisa worth the price?" After an intro- 
duction to the machine, we'll explore the possi- 
ble answers to that question, as well as to the 
question of how this new computer could im- 
pact upon the current state of computer usage. 

The "blind-man effect," as we'll call the 
analysis problem, also means that no one 
author is likely to perceive all the aspects of the 
Lisa, nor can one article answer all the ques- 
tions that the readers are likely to have. In this 
article, we'll try to present two views of the Lisa, 
one centering on the more applications-minded 
person who is mainly interested in the immedi- 
ate uses of the machine, and another that con- 




Figure 1. 



ware and software details of the machine for those interested in the tech- 
nical aspects. 

The First Date with Lisa. Unpacking a Lisa and the boxes of its 
various components is a little like a blind date with someone whom you've 
heard is better than perfect. Expectations can be a little overdemanding, 
and nervousness and excitement abound. 

With all the media talk of the Lisa being so easy to use, you half ex- 
pect it to jump out of the boxes and set itself up. Well, needless to say, it 
isn't quite that easy. 

Although the Lisa manuals are very good, it's not always obvious 
which of the many chapters one should be reading. Besides, the notion of 
reading a manual when your brand-new Lisa is inches away is rather like 
the thought of taking along an etiquette book on that blind date. 

Well, eventually everything is in its place and the Lisa is brought to 
life. Figure 1 shows how everything looks when set up (this is how you 
keep your computer set up, isn't it?), and figure 2 shows what the usual 
office system screen setup looks like with the basic icons present. 

The office system is the environment in which the various tools (Li- 
sa's applications programs) are used. The tools, stored on the ProFile, 
are LisaWrite, LisaCalc, LisaDraw, LisaGraph, LisaProject, and Lisa- 
List. The screen depicts an executive desktop where all of our electronic 
paper-pushing is about to occur. Icons are the graphic symbols used to 
represent the various tools, documents, and devices available to you. A 
document is any file that you can open up and write information in by 
using one of the tools. 

The mouse is sort of an upside-down track ball that can be rolled 
around on your own (real) desktop to control a pointer on Lisa's (elec- 
tronic) desktop that selects the icon you wish to manipulate. Besides just 
moving things around, clicking the button on the mouse with the point- 
er on a menu choice selects that choice. For example, in figure 2, click- 
ing the mouse with the menu bar highlighted as shown "opens" up most 
icons so that you can view their contents. 

On first exposure, it's easy to spend some time (certainly more than 
fifteen minutes, but it doesn't seem like it) just experimenting before you 
run any actual program. It's fun just to move the mouse around and 
poke ail the screen icons to see what happens. 



Of course, one can never resist the temptation to do things like put 
the ProFile icon in the trash-can icon to see what happens. Lisa is very 
forgiving of such youthful mischief; the ProFile icon merely scurries back 
to its original spot on the desktop when you try such antics. 

When you choose an icon, the display is dramatic. A box outline 
pops out of the icon and swiftly expands from tiny icon size into a large 
window. Closing the document the window displays does the same thing 
in reverse. Figure 3 shows the desktop with three windows opened. 
These experiments usually draw a crowd (if there's anyone around) and 
each icon's opening and closing elicits the oohs and aahs usually asso- 
ciated with a fireworks display. The ultimate cheap thrill is opening as

many icons as possible on the screen and then telling Lisa to close them 
all at once. (As you can tell by now, this article was researched in only the 
most professional of manners.) 

Well, on with the story. You'll notice that there are four basic icons 
on the screen desktop. There is a ProFile, which represents the five- 
megabyte hard disk that comes with the Lisa. There is also the waste- 
basket, which is used to dispose of unwanted items. The clipboard is a 
temporary storage spot whose primary use is in editing documents and 
in copying all or part of one document to another. For example, one 
could take part of a spreadsheet generated in LisaCalc and copy it to a 
letter being written in Lisa Write simply by copying the desired text to the 
clipboard, moving from LisaCalc to LisaWrite, and then retrieving the 
data from the clipboard to put in the letter. 

Learning the Ropes. One of the big advantages of the Lisa is that the 
principles you learn in one portion of the system usually apply to every 
other section as well. This means that, once you have learned how to use 
one tool, you can learn the others very quickly. These general principles 
of operation are even extended to the Workshop, an optional (meaning 
you buy it separately) developers' package that is essentially the pro- 
gramming level of the Lisa. In addition, the manuals for all the tools 
share a common format, and the bulk of each manual is a good tutorial 
on the features of that tool. 

You can probably tell already that one of the nicest things about the 
Lisa is that you can do almost everything on a very intuitive level. The 
old Apple directory format of catalogs and file types does not exist. In- 
stead, files are arranged in treelike structures and, for the user, it's even 
simpler than that sounds. 

For example, when the ProFile is opened, you find a number of items 
stored there. Remember that on the Lisa opening a file is a very funda- 
mental concept. It's more like opening up the drawer of a filing cabinet 
than it is like opening a computer file. You can choose to look at the con- 
tents in a variety of ways. For example, figure 4 shows the contents of the 
ProFile arranged by icon. Figure 5 shows the contents arranged 
chronologically, with the size of each file, date of origin, and other infor- 
mation written out in a way that's a little more like a disk catalog. 

If you wanted, for example, to create a chart, the first step would be 
to find on the ProFile the icon labeled LisOGraph Paper. This is anal- 
ogous to finding a tablet of graph paper in your office when you want to 
create a chart. When the LisaGraph Paper icon is located, selecfing it per- 
forms an operation known as "tearing off a sheet" of LisaGraph paper. 
This creates the single sheet of paper (the data file) on which our graph 
will be made. 

Figures 6 and 7 illustrate what the screen might look like after a 
graph has been created. On the left portion of the screen is part of a sim-

Whether you have a small re- 
tall company, manage a service 
agency or run a cattle ranch,you 
have to do something else well 
to build a business — manage 
money. 

You've got to analyze cash 
flow, see trends and forecast 
profitability in a time and cost 
effective manner. 

The right fit. 

A computerized account- 
ing system makes sense, 
but fi nd i ng the right soft- 
ware is important. The 
"home checkbook" pro- 
grams are easy to use but 
they don't have the ad- 
vanced reporting capabilities you need. And many 
small businesses just don't need the complexity or the 
cost of the modular systems. 

Practical Accountant is a single entry, small busi- 
ness accounting program that comes complete in one 
package. It's friendly enough to balance your check- 
book, yet sophisticated enough to give you the kind of 
money management information you need for a suc- 
cessful business. 

We could have called it 
"Accounting Made Easy". 

Practical Accountant is designed around funda- 
mental accounting procedures. Even if you don't 
know much about accounting it is an ideal program. 

The manual explains basic accounting terminology 
and providesa comprehensive tutorial. Itwilltakeyou 
step-by-step through the process of setting up a com- 
plete, single entry accounting system you can begin 
using right away. 



It's quick to learn and 
convenient to use. 

The program guides you with 
easy-to-use menus and provides 
on the screen prompting. 
"HELP" is never more than a 
keystroke away. It even does 
some of your work for you like 
organizing entries in date order 
even if you don't. 

It's very flexible. You set it 
up to fit your business. 

Practical Accountant allows 
you to set up your "Chart of Ac- 
counts" (income and expense 
categories) with up to 50 cate- 
gories, 300 sub-categories and 
with 20 tax type definitions — all 
defined by you. The manual shows you how to set up 
an accounting system for a small business, complete 
with samples. 

Cash Flow Reporting — 

money management information. 

Perhaps the most valuable feature of the program 
is the cash flow reporting capability. You can look at 
cash flow by category, by sub-category and by tax type 
to analyze profitability, tax consequences and general 
performance. All of your reports are professionally 
formatted and you have access to profitability infor- 
mation that leads to sound business management. 

There is more to this success story. 

If you would like to know more about Practical Ac- 
countant your dealer can give you a great demonstra- 
tion and a brochure with a more complete story, or

plified spreadsheet on which the basic data for the graph has been re- 
corded. On the right in each photo is the graph created from the data. It 
should be noted that ail scaling, labeling, and even shading is performed 
automatically by the software, with the user being responsible only for 
entering the data correctly. 

The different graphs were created by pulling down the chart-type 
menu at the top of the screen and selecting either pie chart or bar chart 
with the mouse pointer. A chart of one type can be regraphed as another 
type nearly instantaneously. 

Printing the chart is also easily done by selecting the print option 
from within the file/edit menu. The Apple Dot Matrix Printer has about 
average abilities when driven by an Apple 11, but with the Lisa software 
telling it what to do it can create unusually good reproductions of the 
document as shown on the screen using the page layouts (full page, half 
page, vertical, or horizontal orientation, and so on) selected by the user. 
(See figure 8.) 

Files can be stored directly back to the ProFile by closing the win- 
dow of the document (and thus the document itself) and then using the 
mouse pointer to pick up the document and move it onto the ProFile 
window or directly over the icon for the ProFile. 

A better way, though, is to take advantage of another file concept 
called the folder. This is also an icon; it's used to represent a group of 
documents. You could, for example, create a folder titled My Charts and 
put the two charts into the folder. Folders can also be nested. That is, 
you could have a folder entitled My Charts, in which are stored three 
other folders, one titled Test Charts, in which you keep any number of 
experimental charts and graphs. 

What You Get with Lisa. So, just what do you get when you buy a 



Lisa? For the time being, the Lisa cannot be purchased without the soft- 
ware or the ProFile, so the list looks something like this: 

* Lisa main unit with one megabyte of RAM, monitor, and two 
floppy drives (0.8 megabyte each) built in. 

* ProFile hard disk, five-megabyte capacity. 

* Keyboard with number pad, detachable. 

* Mouse control unit (one button). 

* Lisa owner's manual with LisaGuide tutorial software. 

* LisaWrite, a word processor. 

* LisaCalc, spreadsheet software. 

* LisaGraph, graphing/ plotting software. 

* LisaDraw, freestyle graphics software. 

* LisaList, database software for simple lists. 

* LisaProject, project management software. 

The Lisa unit itself has three interface slots in the back, each of which 
accommodates two devices. These can be printers, modems, even more 
ProFiles. There are three built-in ports along the back, two serial and one 
parallel. (See figure 9.) The ProFile is usually connected to the built-in 
parallel port. There's even a reset button back there, but its use is recom- 
mended only in the most drastic of circumstances, namely a complete 
system lock-up, since any files currently open when reset is pressed would 
be lost. You can't use the power button to recover from a lock-up be- 
cause it isn't actually connected to the power line; it's more accurately 
thought of as a "power-down-request" button. 

Apple had maintenance in mind when they designed the Lisa. All 
major parts with exception of the video tube and related parts can be re- 
moved by the user by hand, with no special tools (not even a screw- 
driver!) required. Figure 10, for example, shows the front panel removed 




Figure 9. 



Figure 12. 



and the disk drive unit slid halfway out. Presumably the notion is that 
you just take the part that needs to be replaced in to your dealer and get a 
new one that works. 

Figure 11 shows the back panel removed. You can see the three in- 
terface slots and some of the circuitry of the Lisa. The yellow handles at 
the end of each slot open the slot up like a Venus's-flytrap to allow inser- 
tion or removal of the interface cards without having to push them in 
from above. The cards are very tall (exactly the height of the available 
space, to be exact), so this approach is necessary. The self-cleaning effect 
of taking cards in and out on the Apple II is probably nonexistent here, 
but maybe Lisas don't oxidize either! 

The power supply is on the far right of the Lisa in figure 1 1 and is a 
separate, removable unit. The center portion of the Lisa also slides out 
and holds four circuit boards, one with the cpu, one with the I /O circuit- 
ry, and two with a half megabyte of RAM each for a total of one 
megabyte. 



The keyboard is a nice one, as shown in figure 12. There is a nu- 
meric keypad, and special functions are provided by the option and ap- 
ple keys in the lower left and right corners of the keyboard. The key- 
board hardware is designed so that the keys are all individually identifi- 
able by software, which allows for a great deal of flexibility. 

The software included is enough to accomplish some of the more ob- 
vious functions of an office computer. Realistically, the bundled pro- 
grams are probably Apple's attempt to make sure that the most impor- 
tant classes of software are immediately available (not to mention pro- 
viding revenues for the company). 

LisaProject is perhaps the most fascinating of the software packages 
included with the Lisa, and some example screen displays are shown in 
figure 13. This software allows a person to break down a major project 




Figure 1 1 . 



Figure 13. 



152 



SEPTEMBER 1983 



into a network of interdependent events or tasks to be done by various 
persons. The user estimates how much time is required to complete each 
task. LisaProject then adds the various amounts of time together to de- 
termine the earliest and latest possible completion dates and also high- 
lights the tasks that are most critical timewise to the project's comple- 
tion. This process is usually called critical path analysis, and it's quite 
time-consuming without the aid of a computer. 

LisaProject also redisplays the project diagram information in bar- 
chart form, with the bars representing the time taken for each project by 
each person in the project (figure 14). 

Most of the software is somewhat similar to products available for 
the Apple II; the big difference lies in the degree of integration between 
the packages, the sophistication of the screen displays, and the general 
processing power available. 

Many of the packages can exchange data among themselves where 
appropriate. You tell Lisa to transfer data simply by copying the parts 
desired to the clipboard and then going to the next tool. 

The displays for the Lisa tools all follow a common theme, so going 
from one tool to another is quite simple. The screen is a high-resolution 
display (720-by-364) so text is easy to read and graphics are sharp. All the 
programs have error messages that are for the most part clear in their 
meaning, and various error messages are accompanied by unique sound 
patterns (earcons, perhaps?). 

The real secret to the Lisa software is the sophistication of the hard- 
ware system that runs it. The amount of computing power in the Lisa is 
staggering; it amounts to nothing less than having a mainframe /mini- 
computer-lev el computer sitting on your desk. Although the technical 
section to follow will go further into the specifics, it can be said that the 
real excitement in the Lisa lies more in the software that the future will 
bring than in any of the software that exists now. 

It's interesting to note, however, that things never change; only the 
form they take does. For example, there's a comparison between some 
familiar functions of the Apple II and the Lisa in figure 15. 

We've already discussed many of the file-related aspects of the Lisa, 
but we should also make a brief mention here of some of the differences 
in disk and memory storage of data, and how I/O devices are handled. 

You'll notice that there are no slot, drive, or volume parameters as- 
sociated with the disk system on the Lisa. A ProFile or floppy disk is 
treated as a continuous block of storage media so that all of the storage 
devices may be used at any time. The numbers 1 and 2 on the built-in disk 
drive units are for the most part arbitrary. Whenever a disk is inserted, it's 
captured by the drive (and not given back until Lisa feels like releasing 
it!) and a disk icon appears on the desktop. The disk eject buttons on the

drives are similar to the power button; they are actually eject request but- 
tons and don't immediately release the disk when pressed. Only after all 
associated files are automatically put away is the disk ejected. 

For the programmer, memory maps are no longer a concern be- 
cause, even at the program level, virtually (so to speak) all of memory is 
automatically managed by internal hardware. That is to say, even though 
there is actually one megabyte of RAM in the computer, the memory 
management unit (MMU) makes any program in memory (and there 
can be several at a time) think it's operating in a sixteen-megabyte envi- 
ronment (although it can't store that much data at one time, of course). 

This brings us to the inner workings of the Lisa and the technical as- 
pects of its operation. If you're the applications sort of person who's just 
waiting for the final opinion on Lisa, skip ahead to the conclusion. 
Otherwise, hang in here and we'll get into the bits and bytes of things. 

Getting inside the Lisa. Glad to see you're here! Now it's fime to get 
really dirty. Any readers with weak stomachs or uncertain alignments 
may not survive this odyssey through Dante's Inferno. So grab your 
schematics, logic diagrams, and memory maps and come along! 

Speaking of memory maps, let's jump into what is probably the most 
difficult aspect of Lisa to understand (no one said this was going to be 
easy). Everyone by now knows that the Lisa comes standard with one 
megabyte of memory. With the Apple II's 64K memory map etched in 
all of our heads, it may be somewhat unnerving to learn that nothing in 
Lisa's memory is where it thinks it is. 

What? Well, the Lisa uses a technique called virtual memory, which 
fools the computer into thinking it has more memory than it actually 
does (a college education can have the same effect on people). The RAM 
memory in Lisa is actually a collection of windows, called segments, 
which look into a much larger apparent address space. When the micro- 
processor looks at an address that isn't contained within one of the seg- 
ments, the command is halted while the memory management unit loads 
from disk the needed block, which is then fooled into thinking it is where 
it's supposed to be. Operation then continues, as if nothing had ever 
happened. 

Did you get that? Let's try an example. But before we do, there are 
two terms you should become acquainted with: logical address and physi- 
cal address. Logical address is where the program or data block thinks it 
is, and physical address is where in the RAM memory it actually is. An 
example: A program is running along and off-handedly references a 
memory location or subroutine or whatnot that's not currently in any 
segment. In such a case, hardware control is given to the memory man- 
agement unit. The MMU loads in from disk the block of memory con- 
taining the whatnot referenced and places it within a free segment. 

Now here's the important part The MMU then fools the micro-

processor into thinking the segment where the block was loaded is its 
true location when execution continues. All this happens without the mi- 
croprocessor having the slightest inkling that it has. This is where logical 
address and physical address come into play. The logical address in our 
example was whatever memory location was referenced, but its physical 
address was wherever the MMU placed it in actual memory. To the pro- 
gram and for all intents and purposes, the logical address is where it ac- 
tually is, but this is only because the MMU is pulling a couple of fast 
ones and causing the addresses to pretend they're someplace else. 

If you're still here, then you've passed through the hardware Infer- 
no's first ring and are ready for a bit of refinement. First off, that expla- 
nation of virtual memory is sufficient only to get us through the rest of 
this article. The actual workings of virtual memory are much more com- 
plex, and deserve an article of their own (for example, when and how 
does the MMU decide that a segment no longer needs to reside in mem- 
ory? What happens when all the segments are full and another is need- 
ed? Ah, well . . .). It isn't necessary to understand virtual memory to 
write a program on the Lisa. What is important is to realize that, with 
virtual memory, each program isn't restricted to addressing a measly 
megabyte, but has a workspace of a gigantic sixteen megabytes. 

So far, there has been no mention of what microprocessor is in the 
Lisa. That is because there are actually five microprocessors working in 
unison to produce all the dazzling effects and unheard-of reliability asso- 
ciated with Lisa. Before all you multiprocessor nuts drag out your pro- 
gramming sheets, note that only one processor is accessible to the as- 
sembly language programmer. But what a processor it is! 

This microprocessor is the Motorola 68000. The heart of all the tricks 
seen on the Lisa, this chip has power. Anyone who's dabbled in 6502 as- 
sembly can appreciate the improvement of the 68000 with its sixteen thirty- 
two-bit registers and more addressing modes than you could ever use 
in one program. It's interesting to note that, although the 68000 can ref- 
erence memory addresses up to thirty-two bits wide (that's four giga- 
bytes, or sixty-five thousand times as much memory as the die-hard Ap- 
ple II), only twenty-four of these bits are brought out of the 68000. The 
reason for this is a restriction of the physical construction of the 68000 in- 
tegrated circuit. If you've ever lifted the lid on your Apple, you know 
what an IC looks like. Well, the 68000 with sixty-four pins (most ICs 
have sixteen or twenty-four) recalls images of huge black monoliths from 
a Kubrick film. There just wasn't enough room on the 68000 package to 
put eight more pins to bring out those eight other bits. This is the reason 
Lisa's virtual memory can only address sixteen megabytes, which is what 
twenty-four bits gives you. 

As a small example of the 68000's power, realize that the Lisa's 
screen is always in the graphics mode, and that all text displayed is gen- 
erated by software (somewhat like Apple's hi-res character generator). 
This is the key to Lisa's great flexibility when dealing with the screen, and 
it accounts for Lisa's twelve different type styles (not to mention bold- 
face, italics, underline, shadow, hollow, super and subscripting . . .) and 
addictive interactive nature. Scrolling is likewise done in software, yet it's 
accomplished without the nauseating wavy motion you would expect 
with hi-res scrolling. More on the screen later. 

Under the 68000"s command are four other processors, each serving 
a specific function and each having its own limited memory and operat- 
ing on the firmware supplied for it. 

First there's the Z8 microprocessor within the ProFile. Although the 
ProFile is not really a part of Lisa proper, it is standard with the Lisa and 
is an integral part of the Lisa system. Without the ProFile and its intelli- 
gent Z8 controller, the Lisa's virtual memory scheme (so important, yet 
so transparent) would be impossible. Instead of having to dedicate its 
entire attention to such mundane tasks as disk I/O, Lisa is able to spec- 
ify what data on the disk to read from or write to, and the ProFile takes 
over. On a down note, it is discouraging that the ProFile has only a five- 
megabyte capacity, whereas other hard disk systems of comparable price 
contain as much as twenty megabytes. 

The other mass-storage related chip is the 6504, which controls Lisa's 
two built-in fioppies, or iwiggies. as Apple calls them. The 6504 is a lim- 
ited 6502, with less addressing space (8K) and fewer control functions 
(such as no nonmaskable interrupt). The 6504, teamed with the twiggies' 
sophisticated hardware, increases the drives' capacity to 860K as well as 



improving the reliability. 

The stepper motor that moves the disk head over the twiggy disk is 
capable of microstepping, which translates to reliability beyond compre- 
hension and sophisticated error recovery. If the 6504 can't find a track 
where it thinks it is, it can move in and out in small fractions of a track 
until it finds it. Also, the motor that spins the disk is capable of varying 
its speed, slowing down on the outer tracks and thus keeping a constant 
10,000 bits per linear inch over the entire disk, giving the outer tracks, 
which have greater circumferences, more to store. This advanced system 
requires a special variety of disk, shown in figure 16. 

As a note, the error rate of a twiggy drive is so low that Apple 
couldn't measure it, but they estimate it at something like one error for 
every trillion operations, which should get you through this century with- 
out problems. All disk drives revolve, but only twiggies are revolu- 
tionary. 

Sp)eaking of getting through this century, Lisa for some reason can 
only keep accurate time and date through 1995. The time and date are 
controlled by a National Semiconductor COPS microprocessor, one of 
two within the Lisa. The second COPS is responsible for decoding the 
keyboard and transmitting the keycodes to the other COPS via the key- 
board's twisted cable. Together, the two of them handle all the low level 
I/O and functions within the Lisa. The time and date COPS stays active 
even when Lisa is off. It updates the time and date while waiting for 
someone to come along and press the power button (figure 17). If 
Lisa is unplugged while in the off state, internal batteries power the time 
and date COPS for up to twenty hours. 

So much for the I nferno's second ring. Now things are starting to get 
a bit easier. On to the fun ones! 

The first thing that breaks even the seasoned programmers' cool fa- 
cade is Lisa's graphics. Even the coolest among them lose their staid dis- 
positions and join the chorus of "oohs" and "ahhs" when they see Lisa 
at work. The hardware behind all this is amazingly simple. A bit-mapped 
graphics screen very similar to the Apple's but consisting of 720 pixels by 
364 lines provides the resolution that makes Lisa's desktop metaphor so 
believable. Every byte within the 32K of screen memory is directly 
mapped to the video display (with the exception of the eight bytes left 
over). Back to our virtual memory, the screen memory is located just 
about anywhere a contiguous segment of 32K is sitting on a 32K bound- 
ary. What this means is that the screen memory is nowhere in particular, 
but almost everywhere at one time or another. 

Although the current screen is black and white, the screen software 
supports up to thirty-two bit planes (which means that up to four trillion 
colors are possible), and the technical manuals hint left and right at a col-

or board that should be out soon. A retrace interrupt is provided which 
can be used to synchronize screen access with the retrace timing so that 
fiicicerless graphics can be attained. Also, since the screen's contrast is 
software controlled, a program can produce any sort of eye-killing ef- 
fects. On the more practical side, software-controlled brightness allows 
Lisa to dim the screen to a specified level after a specified period of inac- 
tivity to save video screen phosphor. Nice. 

What is that little thing with such a long tail sitting next to Lisa? 
Why, that's a mouse, one of the most innovative peripherals yet. Mice 
have been around for some time, but only now are they making such a 
noise in the marketplace. It has been estimated that the average mouse 
will travel almost twenty miles in a year's usage, and Apple's mouse is 
not one to be caught without its track shoes. It's rumored that the plot- 
ter used to put Lisa's mouse through its paces died before the mouse even 
began to sweat. 

For no apparent reason (except perhaps novelty), Lisa's mouse 
comes complete with a software odometer that is reset to zero on each 
power-up. Real cute. Essential to successful mousing is the cursor, a 16- 
by-1 6-bit image necessary to translate the mouse's movement from the 
physical desktop to the metaphysical one. The feel of actually moving the 
cursor on the screen is phenomenal, and it'll take anyone with an arm no 
time at all to accept the mouse as standard. In fact, on Lisa's desktop, 90 
percent of the interaction is done with the mouse. What a joy to use! 

The biology of a mouse is such (for those who want the gory details): 
A hard rubber ball (which doesn't bounce too well) rests under the mouse 
and just touches whatever surface the mouse is sitting on. As the mouse 
is shoved from one location to another (as only mice will tolerate), the 
ball within likewise revolves, turning two small flywheels. Each flywheel 
is responsible for recognizing its particular axis of motion. As each fly- 
wheel turns, a small Benham-like disk turns also, causing a light beam to 
be interrupted and a movement of one unit to be recognized. Motion in 
any direction is recorded as a series of these small movements, and inter- 
nally they are translated to screen coordinates. Basically, a mouse's life is 
uneventful (with a few exceptions), but what it does, it does well. 

What Turns Lisa On? One of the hardest things to accept for some- 
one who's always flipped a toggle switch is that Lisa never really turns 
off When a power-off request is made (by pressing the on/off button), 
Lisa calmly closes any open files and powers down with the sophistica- 
tion expected from a computer of such background. When "off," Lisa is 
actually in a low-power mode, updating the time and date and patiently 
waiting for someone to come along and press her button. When this hap- 
pens, the COPS which senses the power-on request energizes a relay that 
turns Lisa on. Control is then passed to a very specialized boot ROM 



which contains I6K of 68000 diagnostics and power-on sequences. 

After the Lisa examines it.self for any anomalies and passes all tests, 
the boot ROM reads a block of boot code from the predefined default 
boot device (either ProFile or twiggy) unless the default is overridden at 
power-on. The selection of the boot device is made from the preferences 
window of the desktop and maintained in low-power RAM. After the 
boot code is loaded, it is executed. What happens next depends on the 
boot code, but in a standard Lisa configuration (using Lisa's own op- 
erating system), System.OS and a host of friends (System. LLD, Sys- 
tem. LOG, and others) are loaded in and System.OS is executed. 

Let's digress for a moment and explain what System.OS is. Probably 
the best analogy is to the Apple II's own DOS. System.OS is like IX)S's 
file manager, consisting of hundreds of routines used to control every as- 
pect of the operating system and its environment. These include calls to 
the file system, process handling, memory management, exception and 
event handling, and system configuration. Like the file manager, Sys- 
tem.OS (to be called "the operating system" from here on) needs some 
controlling program to provide the user interface. DOS's equivalent 
would be what we all mistakingly call DOS, but what is really just the 
command interpreter to supply the necessary man-machine interface. 

Lisa's operating system, once in memory, loads and executes Sys- 
tem. Shell, which is Lisa's command interpreter. In the desktop environ- 
ment that we usually see Lisa displaying, this shell is the Environments 
window (see figure 18), which is normally transparent on bootup and is 
responsible for bringing up the desktop software. If however, the de- 
fault shell to use on power-on is the Workshop, for example, then Envi- 
ronments will load and execute the Workshop shell. Basically, Sys- 
tem.OS loads and runs System. Shell, which is the interface between user 
and operating system. 

What is the Workshop? The Workshop is a shell that provides a 
UCSD Pascal-like environment for writing and debugging programs. 
Complete with the Workshop are an editor, Pascal and Cobol compilers, a 
Basic interpreter, a 68000 assembler and debugger, and an ample supply 
of support programs. These languages and utilities make up the Lisa de- 
velopment package, which doesn't come with Lisa but may be pur- 
chased separately. All the operating system calls can be made from Pas- 
cal and assembly. In fact, most of the operating system was written in 
Pascal (some 900,000 lines worth!), with only a few speed-critical rou- 
tines, such as the graphics software, written in 68000 assembly (only 
40,000 lines). 

It was this Workshop that Apple developers used to write all of the 
software for Lisa. Sound like a chicken and egg situation? Well, the orig- 
inal Pascal compiler from the Apple II language system was strapped

onto a very young Lisa, then used to write the rest of the operating sys- 
tem. By the way, the Pascal compiler in the Workshop translates source 
to an intermediate file, which is enhanced p-code and is good for noth- 
ing except the Workshop generator, which produces 68000 machine 
code. All in all, anything is possible in the Workshop. 

Where were we? Oh yes, Lisa's power-up sequence. . . . Well, in some 
sort of roundabout manner, we've just explained it. 

Don't let anyone tell you otherwise: The Lisa is anything but a micro. 
With multitasking (which we haven't discussed, but which essen- 
tially means that many processes can run concurrently) and virtual mem- 
ory (giving each process sixteen megabytes of program and data space), 
the Lisa easily competes against many of the "all-powerful" main- 
frames. In fact, the only apparent reason that it's not considered a main- 
frame is that it doesn't fill a specially air-conditioned room and doesn't 
require a flock of smocked technicians to operate. Outside the desktop, 
Lisa is still a completely integrated system, with an extremely powerful 
operating system running very powerful state-of-the-art hardware. There 
will certainly be a large quantity of very happy Lisa owners still around 
when the real-time clock peaks out in 1995. Apple Computer had better 
be prepared to supply a firmware patch for all these people to carry them 
through the rest of the century. 

Conclusion(s). After all of two weeks with Lisa, what do we think of 
it? Granted that the honeymoon's not over, we still have some general 
impressions. 

When you first see a demonstration of the machine, you're apt to 
have a feeling about it rather like the one you probably had when you 
got your first Apple. Many of us came to computers knowing little about 
them or about what could be done with one, but they seemed intrinsical- 
ly fascinating. Even if you now know at least a little more about com- 
puters, you'll probably have much the same feeling about the Lisa. 

Any single word is too weak to accurately describe the sense of the in- 
credible the machine can elicit. The potential housed in that simple case 
is truly staggering. The most expert, most veteran Apple II users have yet 
to explore even a fraction of the potential of their machines. The internal 
power and level of integration of the Lisa seems like going from a bi- 
cycle to a starship. 

Your reactions to the machine might well vary, though. When you 
first start using the machine, you're mainly aware only of the appear- 
ance of the applications software, the tools. Initially very impressed, you 
might then begin feeling like the $10,000 price tag is, for the average per- 
son, a lot to pay for the convenience of smooth graphics and easy data 
transfer between programs. For the stereotypical business executive, the 
usability of the Lisa is probably worth the expense, but the cost factor 
is certainly high. 

In all fairness, even with this view, the price difference is not as high 
as you might think. An Apple II with all the equivalent hardware and 
software could still cost more than half the cost of a Lisa. With that in 
mind, the convenience factor is not costing as much as you would origi- 
nally suppose. 

If then you learn more about the inner nature of the machine and be- 
gin to realize its tremendous potential, a different picture emerges. 

The first conclusion is that cost is a very relative thing. Think for a 
moment about your reaction to the possibility of paying $10,000 for a 
television, a car, or a house. 

Ten thousand dollars for a television is certainly expensive. For a car, 
it is at least within current price ranges, and for a house it would be a bar- 
gain. Expensive then is not an absolute value, but rather a ratio between 
actual cost and perceived value. In addition, even large amounts of 
money do not present as big a barrier to purchase as many people seem 
to think. Most likely, many of the people you know own things like 
houses and cars in spite of their high cost. In addition, think of the num- 
ber of people who own motorhomes that cost far in excess of $10,000 
and at that only use them once a year. 

Clearly, the real question is not, "Is it expensive?" but rather, "Is it 
worth the price?" 

The ultimate answer will depend on a number of things. For some- 
one in a business environment, the likelihood of a Lisa being worth it is 
admittedly much greater. Along with doing the research on the Lisa for 
the purposes of this article, we've put it to use in our office, and there are 



already at least a half a dozen people using the Lisa for official func- 
tions. Even tho.se who never quite got around to learning to use the Ap- 
ple lis seemed to be attracted immediately to using the Lisa. 

The graphics and printer output on LisaWrite, LisaDraw and Lisa- 
Graph alone give one the equivalent of an in-house graphics studio. The 
cost savings in this area alone help justify a major portion of the ma- 
chine's cost. In addition, the graphics capabilities will make possible pro- 
fessional-looking documents, forms, diagrams, and charts for those proj- 
ects that wouldn't ordinarily justify the expense of a graphics depart- 
ment. For the home user, it's probably still a matter of waiting a little 
longer for more software. You might look at it this way: Would you buy 
a motorhome before a Lisa? 

You can bet that time will very quickly change all the factors in both 
business and home. It should be clear by now that the power of the ma- 
chine is scarcely even hinted at by the existing software. If you think back 
for a moment about what has been done in software for the Apple II, 
considering the comparatively limited capabilities of the machine, the po- 
tential of the Lisa seems almost limitless. 

The second conclusion is how the Lisa and computers like it are 
going to affect us all. There is more than enough written about how com- 
puters are going to change our lifestyles. This will probably happen, and 
there are some changes that we should see very soon. 

An example at hand is the dot-matrix printer. There's still a ten- 
dency to think that people really need letter-quality printers to generate 
business correspondence on their computers. The assumption seems to 
be that either dot-matrix print is totally unreadable or that people will be 
offended to receive any letter that was done on a computer rather than 
on a typewriter. 

Ignoring for a moment that dot-matrix printers are improving to the 
point where they are less and less distinguishable from a daisy-wheel 
printer (read "typewriter"), the real point is, dot-matrix printers do the 
job better than typewriters. For someone to criticize a dot-matrix letter 
because it doesn't look like a typewriter is like criticizing a car because it 
doesn't look like a horse. 

The Lisa printer graphics are like this. You might look at an invoice 
form (and 1 mean the pretty lines and logos, not the numbers) gener- 
ated by a Lisa and say, "But it doesn't look like it was done by hand." 
That is precisely the point. Would you deride a neighbor's new wallpa- 
per because it wasn't hand-painted? Of course not, and neither should 
anyone get too picky about being able to tell that a form or a letter was 
done by a computer. 

The point is that a computer is a far more efficient way of accom- 
plishing a given task, and that the person not using one is to be pitied for 
not yet having caught on to the revolution already surrounding us. 

My prediction? No predictions at all. Look today for the Lisa-gen- 
erated letters, project charts, financial reports, and invoice forms. The 
people generating those are the people who know where the 
future lies.

HOW I 

Apple 
Presents 
Lisa 

David Purkee 

Assume that an executive has no time to learn 
about computers but has ten thousand dollars 
to spend on a computer that takes no time to 
learn. Well, almost no time. Where does said 
executive go to learn about this computer? Af- 
ter all, it isn't as easy as saying, "Hey, Lisa, plan 
my budget for fiscal 1984 and watch for cost 
overruns in produption." To be sure, Lisa talks 
to the user in a way that should be nonthreat- 
ening even to the most practiced technophobe, 
saying things like, "Excuse me, you asked me to 
monitor the printer, but there is no printing go- 
ing on now," instead of, "Illegal quantity er- 
ror — break in 320." The hurdle is generally not 
in learning to understand Lisa but in learning to 
talk to her. 

Apple is prepared to help its corporate cus- 
tomers over this hurdle with a small, informal 
training session. The general target audience is 
comprised of the top 1,300 corporations in the 
country, although it isn't limited strictly to this 
group. The one-day session is available free to 
Apple's national accounts: Corporations that 
are purchasing several Lisas for their lop man- 
agers can send those managers to Lisa school. 
Apple has established twelve offices across the 
country, located in areas expected to have the 
highest volume of sales, with conference rooms 
dedicated to Lisa training. 

In a typical class, there might be seven "stu- 
dents," usually all from the same company, 
each sitting at a Lisa. Apple's "teachers" know 
the Lisa inside and out and are good at helping 
people who don't. No question is too simple 
and very few are too complicated. And they 
have a good assistant teacher in the Lisa itself. 

With coffee and doughnuts in hand, the stu- 
dents sit down to a short videotape of an execu- 
tive using a Lisa in his work and explaining how 
each of the Lisa programs can help him with his 
everyday tasks. The tape is more demonstrative 
than instructive; it serves as an overview of Lisa 
for those who have never seen her in action and 
as a refresher for those who have. 

It's not long before students get to try things 
out for themselves. LisaGuide, one of the pro- 
grams that come with Lisa, is running on all the 
machines when the session begins. The tutorial 
is a gentle introduction to the basics of talking

to Lisa. The first concepts are the mouse and 
the cursor. LisaGuide teaches how to move 
the mouse and how that movement controls the 
cursor, which is displayed as a black arrow on 
the screen. With the mice tamed, LisaGuide 
shows how certain symbols on the screen can 
act as buttons and how you can push those but- 
tons by pointing at them with the arrow and 
pushing the mouse button. 

An important concept for the Lisa beginner 
to grasp — one designed to make it easier to un- 
derstand the system as a whole — is that the Lisa 
screen, sometimes called the desktop environ- 
ment, is really an extended metaphor for an 
executive's desk and other elements of a typical 
office. There's the filing cabinet, the file folder, 
the wastebasket, the clipboard, the clock, the 
calendar, and the calculator; one wonders why 
they didn't actually create scissors and glue pot 
icons for cut-and-paste operations. Most of 
Lisa's tools are used in ways that are analogous 
to the ways you would accomplish the same 
goals without a computer. Once people under- 
stand the Lisa metaphor, they know as much 
about Lisa as they might have learned about the 
Apple II in the first week or two. 

With that hurdle cleared, the rest of Lisa- 
Guide covers most of the elements of Lisa that 
are common to all the bundled programs. All 
the files that Lisa can manipulate are displayed 
in windows, and windows act like pieces of pa- 
per on the desktop. You can have one paper on 
your desk at a time, or you can have a pile of 
papers from completely different projects and

work on the one on top. 

LisaGuide shows how to change the size of a 
window, move it, put one on top of another, 
and select which one you're working with. Just 
as on your real desk, you can have several dif- 
ferent things going on at once. While you're 
working, how organized your desk is depends 
mostly on your preferences and your own in- 
herent talent for organization. When you quit 
for the day, however, you can tell Lisa to put 
everything away for you. This is one of Lisa's 
big advantages: She can conform to your habits. 

Since LisaGuide comes bundled with the 
computer, you may well wonder what advan- 
tage there is to running it in Apple's classroom 
rather than your own office. Studies have 
shown that the average executive is interrupted 
once every seven minutes; the session at Apple 
reserves a block of uninterrupted time just for 
that reason. 

A more important advantage is that people 
are there to help Lisa be your guide. The rea- 
son most computers prefer jargon to English is 
that jargon, if you know it, is a more precise 
language. For instance, at one point, LisaGuide 
instructs you to put the cursor over a certain 
word on the screen. The computer means to su- 
perimpose the cursor on top of the word, but 
someone could just as easily interpret it as 
saying to move the cursor to the line above the 
word. Having someone handy who knows the 
right meaning can avert some frustrating 
moments. 

The nice thing about computer-aided in- 
struction is that learners can go at their own

knowledgeable user may experience an even 
greater surprise. Lisa, the computer made for 
people who are least likely to want to pull a 
computer apart, is designed to be completely 
modular — far more so than any Apple to come 
before it, in fact. When a Lisa goes down, the 
owner's going to want it back up again fast. 
Most of the time, Lisa can tell you where it 
hurts. With parts that are easily removable, 
what can't be quickly repaired can be quickly 
replaced. 

Plenty of people who buy Lisas won't have 
the opportunity to go to one of these training 
sessions. And plenty of people won't need to 
anyway. But nobody who buys a Lisa will be 
without a source of help. More is required of 
Lisa dealers than is currently required of Apple 
II and III vendors. Lisa dealers must meet re- 
quirements for minimum size and have a large 
enough staff that some sales can be done in the 
field. Their salesmen must be suitably trained to 
support the product after the sale, and the stores 
are obligated to provide that support. They 
know Lisa, so they're prepared to answer ques- 
tions. They come to you to help with the instal- 
lation, and in some cases they even make house 
calls after the sale. 

For the most part, Lisa users should be able 
to get by without extra help, because Lisa helps 
more than you'd imagine any computer can. 
What people that already use a computer know, 
people about to get started on Lisa will quickly 
discover: It's just a matter of getting their feet 
wet. 



pace. Some finish LisaGuide in forty-five min- 
utes and are ready for more; others take all day. 
And anyone can ask questions without getting 
ahead of the rest of the group or slowing them 
down. 

Once people finish the tutorial, the teachers 
help them get started with any of the main Lisa 
programs: LisaCalc, LisaWrite, LisaProject, 
LisaList, LisaGraph, or LisaDraw. Which to 
look at first is up to the individual. All the pro- 
grams are on the ProFile, of course, and the 
manuals include tutorials that start where Lisa- 
Guide leaves off As before, there's the security 
of being able to follow the prescribed path at a 
comfortable rate, but there's also greater free- 
dom. The more adventurous tend to make up 
data from their actual work experience instead 
of strictly following the examples in the tu- 
torials. 

At the end of the session, the Apple people 
demonstrate some applications that are more 
advanced than those that most people will get to 
on the first exposure to the computer. Final- 
ly — perhaps this is the most astounding event of 
the day for anyone who thinks the case of a ten- 
thousand-dollar computer is inviolate — they 
take a Lisa apart. Twist a few thumb screws; off 
comes the back. Flip a catch; there goes the 
front panel. The disk drives slide easily out 
through the front; the circuit boards come out 
the back. As casually as the magician sawing the 
assistant in half, they break Lisa up into a pile 
of parts. 

For the uninitiated, this can go a long way 
toward demystifying the computer. A more

Enchanter. By Marc Blank and Dave Lebling. 

John John Morrison Morrison 
Weatherbee George Dupree 

Took good care of his mother 
though he was only three. . . . 

John John said to his mother, 
"Mother," he said, said he, 

"You must never make friends with a fire-breathing dragon 
without consulting me." 

Where is Zork? Alive and well in magic school. The result? Enchant- 
er, the beginning of a trilogy sequel to the Zorks. 

No longer is Zork condemned to subterranea. Enchanter takes place 
in a natural — if fanciful — world, a sunlit world. Well, at first it's a sunlit 
world. But the powers of darkness would have it otherwise. As the ap- 
prentice enchanter pursues his quest, the days grow alarmingly shorter. 
Soon the sun is rising at noon and setting at 2:00 p.m. Only the young 
apprentice's quick study and apt use of powerful magic can prevent the 
world from perpetual night. 

Can magic be logical? Dam tootin'. Determining when and where 
and how to use which spells provides puzzles as clever and logical as 
those in any Zork. Without clear, innovative thinking, the enchanter's 
magic is useless. Or sometimes when it's useful it's misguided. Several 



spells can be cast only once; exactly the same number of puzzles can be 
solved only one way — with those spells. But the spells work in plenty of 
other places and even solve other puzzles that seem to be insoluble 
otherwise. 

In line with Infocom's new mysteries and recent science-fiction ad- 
ventures. Enchanter expands interaction with other characters beyond 
that of earlier Infocom games and of most other games. Even animals 
become confidants — or informers — when you have the right magic. 

Enchanter 1% not chock-full of breakthroughs. It is simply a delightful 
adventure that takes advantage of the niceties and expertise Infocom has 
been nurturing at such a fast clip. 

Zork's world isn't forgotten. The period is the same, or very close to 
it, and, although these people live above ground, they remember Zork

users of word processing, Pascal, and CP/M. With the advent of the Ap- 
ple He came Apple's own eighty-column display card, at a very competi- 
tive price. This seemed to signal the demise of the independent visual 
boards.

Instead of giving up, or even of producing a me-too copy of Apple's 
board, Videx lias struck out into new territory; the result is the Ultra- 
term video display board. The Ultraterm provides for seven — that's 
right, seven — separate display modes. And the hardware works with the 
Apple II Plus, the Apple lie, and the Apple III. It's fully compatible with 
the principal Apple operating systems — Apple DOS, Apple Pascal, Sof- 
tech's Pascal, and CP/M. Full cursor movement through either escape or 
control sequer^ces is provided for, as is the capability to change video dis- 
play modes at will. 

The Ultraterm's display capability is terrific. Besides the default stan- 
dard 24-line-by-80-column display with seven-by-nine-dot character font, 
you can select 24 lines by 96 columns, 32 lines by 128 columns, 24 lines 
by 132 columns, or 48 lines by 80 columns. If that isn't enough, there's a 
special high-density display that produces a clean, solid character set. In- 
verse video is standard with the Ultraterm, as is a "soft switch" to sense 
automatically whether a forty- or eighty-column display is required and 
respond accordingly. The competition may have to turn to three-dimen- 
sional holograms to top this. 

Despite its many convolutions of capability, the Ultraterm is re- 
markably simple to operate. It's slot-independent in newer Apples (re- 
quires slot 0 in older Apples) and installs in only a few minutes. To get it 
up and running, you simply PR# to its slot or call it from software, then 
choose the video format you want with a simple control sequence from 
DOS or CP/M. The Ultraterm defaults to a Videx Videoterm emula- 
tion mode, so most software that works with the Videoterm should work 
with the new Ultraterm. 

The Ultraterm performs its magic in several ways. The amount of 
video information transmitted to the monitor is approximately 1.6 times 
that normally conveyed. In display modes of thirty-two or forty-eight 
lines a technique called interlacing — updating the screen characters at 
half the conventional scan rate — is employed. Because of the reduced 
scan rate, monitors with low-persistence phosphors may tend to flicker 
or shimmer. Videx recommends using monitors with a minimum band- 
width of fifteen megahertz such as the Apple Monitor III, NEC models 
JB-902M and JB-120IM, and Sanyo models VM4509 and VM45I2. 

The Ultraterm shines brightest in use with spreadsheets and word 
processors. Videx provides preboot software for using the Ultraterm 
with VisiCalc and will soon offer the same thing for Apple Writer II. 
Patches to configure WordStar for a 48-line-by-80-column display are 
given in the manual. Other compatibilities are expected to come from 
software publishers; Hayden has announced that PIE Writer will soon 
support a 24-line-by-128-column display with Ultraterm. 

In this unique industry, you can't count a company out just because 
its main product has been made obsolete. With the true pioneer spirit, 
this industry's companies are more likely to develop whole new genera- 
tions of applications. That's what Videx has done. V^yil

Zaxxon. By John Garcia. Here's a game that debuted in Softalk\ Top 
Thirty last month at number two. The game is popular, that much is cer- 
tain. But how good is it? 

Questions like this must always be taken in the proper context. Data- 
soft's Zaxxon is the official Apple version of the coin-operated game that 
hit the arcades about a year and a half ago. When Zaxxon walked in, we 
all fell to the floor in awe. Quarters lined up as former Pac-Man devo- 
tees stood tiptoe to see over the tall kids in front and catch a glimpse of 
this graphics wonder. 

In those days, a lot of our Apples were still grabbing the gusto of 
Beer Run and munching down on Taxman. How far we've come. 

Now Zaxxon is walking into our computer stores, and we're all fall- 
ing to the floor in awe again. But for all the wrong reasons. 

One of the reasons we buy computer games is to simulate arcade en- 
tertainment without having to wait in endless lines and plunk down a 
quarter for each play. But if you've taken a look at the arcades recently, 
the lines for Zaxxon have all but disappeared, with all the footprints 
leading to the newer blood. 

But it doesn't matter. Finally, we have an official version of a coin-op 
game that really looks like the original. Jaded, but still the original. 

For the benefit of those who have been out of the country, in pursuit 



of spiritual fulfillment, or otherwise out of touch with arcade reality, 
Zaxxon is the basic shoot-them-before-they-shoot-you game, but with a 
delicious look. The key to the game's success is its perspective. You see 
your space craft in a combined perspective from above, the side, and be- 
hind. Lay a book on a table a foot to your left and a foot in front of you 
and you'll have the Zaxxon perspective. 

The scenery moves from the upper right-hand corner to the lower 
left-hand corner of your screen, and it moves toward you. You're shoot- 
ing at planes, gun turrets, missiles, fuel tanks, and radars before you go 
off and do space battle with other ships. The only control you have of 
your space craft is vertical and horizontal. No speeding up, no slowing 
down. 

Broken down to its basic elements, Zaxxon is very much like the me- 
teor shower in Sneakers, Autobahn with guns, or even plain old Space In- 
vaders. In other words, there are things coming at you; shoot them or die. 
Oh, there is somewhat of a point to all this: Eventually destroy a robot 
for no apparent reason other than because it wants to destroy you for no 
apparent reason. 

On the lighter side of things, Datasoft's John Garcia deserves a 
hearty round of applause for a superb piece of programming. The graph- 
ics are an outstanding reproduction of the original's, simulating diag- 
onal scrolling while many games are still trying to hurdle vertical and 
horizontal movement. The sound effects are used conservatively — agi- 
tating where they should be, but not obnoxiously so. If this game is any 
indication of talent, Garcia is a programmer to keep an eye on. 

Zaxxon is a playable game once you get used to the perspective (al- 
though many times you'll make it well past a wall or missile, but your 
ship's exploding will indicate otherwise). It's selling like crazy and prob- 
ably will continue to do so because it looks "cool," because the origi- 
nal was a tremendous success in its heyday, and because of its 
name. nrv

Money Street. By Donald Hill and Robert Payne. About a year ago, 
Nevada ski enthusiast and businessman Robert Payne decided he need- 
ed a home financial program to balance his checking account and col- 
lect financial data in the process. He went through about six of the best 
known and gave up. He deemed programs rigid and unfriendly; and he 
didn't need the hassle. Payne took the matter in hand and collaborated 
with a professional programmer, Don Hill, to design a program that 
could be learned easily and set up quickly and that would "run friend- 
ly." He wanted a program that could work as well for small businesses as 
for households. And he wanted it to have standard commands and codes 
so that it could be used by different operators — a husband and wife, a 
boss and secretary — for an unlimited number of checking accounts. 

The result is Money Street. It's a checkbook designed for everyone, 
from computer buffs itching to start and scared-stiff computerphobes to 
novices with their first checking accounts or CPAs. Aspects of home or 
personal money management that are handled include checks, charge 
cards, cash control, automated teller transactions, "checkless" bill-pay- 
ing, and budgeting. You can split checks into two or more categories 
(such as to keep track of interest and principal for house payments). 

A complete set of reports can be printed out in hard copy or re- 
viewed on-screen. And you can print the contents of the screen at any 
time. 

Money Street can print running totals of tax deductions, income, or 
tax credit items. With these, you can quickly estimate next year's taxes 
and take necessary action. A small business benefits by Money Street's 
capacity to print year-to-date (and monthly) totals of sales, department 
expenses, and salaries. 

All categories of entries are open to user definition, so you can 
choose which items to track. Money Street uses a program disk and a 
separate data disk for each checking acount and for each new year. You 
do need an optional, extra-cost utility disk to make copies of data disks; 
the extra disk also makes two backup copies of the program disk, among 
other abilities. 

Setting up is simple and well prompted. For each data disk, you in- 
put the name of the checking account and the beginning balance. And 
you create a code dictionary comprised of up to one hundred number 



168 



SEPTEMBER 1983 



codes for credits and debits. The menu-driven program disk then shifts 
you to a facsimile of your checicbooic. Money Street displays seventeen 
items per screen and can scroll for more; a running balance is always 
shown. 

Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Money Street is the code dic- 
tionary, a screen-behind-the-screen data bank that appears instantly on 
command. Scrolling through the dictionary, you can see year-to-date to- 
tals of all entries: deposits, house interest payments, salaries, gasoline ex- 
penses, entertainment, and groceries, for example. Through the diction- 
ary, you can set up subtotal groups of categories, keeping areas such as 
income in one section, tax-deductible debits in another, and nondeducti- 
bles in yet another. 

Money Street makes use of whatever features your printer can han- 
dle. It can print reports in condensed, emphasized, double-width, italic, 
and bold typefaces. You can insert a top-of-the-form command at the 
end of each report, set line spacing, set carriage returns, and skip or ob- 
serve perforations. Once entered, the setup holds until you choose to 
change it. 

Money Street has some special features for real estate ownership. The 
program tracks rents, tallies repair costs, and helps establish cost bases 
for capital-gain tax treatment. It's also set up for trust accounting, small

According to Rhiannon, almost all families purchasing a home com- 
puter have at least one daughter or granddaughter. Yet more boys play 
video games, go to computer camps, and learn Basic than girls. Rhian- 
non believes that computer hardware and software are subtly marketed 
toward males. (After all, didn't Time magazine name the computer the 
man of the year?) 

The Rhiannon company is worried about the future of little girls if 
they don't get involved with computers like little boys — and about the fu- 
ture of a country that will need computer expertise from both sexes. Not 
surprisingly, Rhiannon was founded by two women, Elizabeth Stott, a 
counseling psychologist, and Lucy Ewell, a computer programmer. 
Ewell has two daughters and Stott has three sons. The friends noticed 
that the girls were not interested in the computer games the boys played. 
So Rhiannon decided to bridge the gap between giris and computers. 

Jenny is the story of a plucky pioneer girl who gets separated from 
her wagon train family and must spend the winter by herself. She must 
avoid immediate dangers like rattlesnakes and packs of coyotes. She 
must also take care of her daily needs. After chopping down wood, Jen- 
ny takes a mirror out of her pocket and reflects the sun onto the logs. The 
flame on the fire dwindles when the fire needs tending. She finds tools on 
the trail: the hatchet to chop the wood and a fishing spear and slingshot 
for hunting. 

Survival is a crucial theme in the game; Rhiannon wanted to present 
real-life situations. The player has to figure out logically how to survive 
with the limited resources at hand. 

In that problem-solving capabilities are required through a group of 
interwoven tasks, Jenny is an adventure. But the game also requires the 
hand and eye coordination of an arcade — when Jenny aims her sling- 
shot at the rabbits who hop about very fast or her spear at the fish who 
swim busily up the stream. 

When Jenny lost the wagon train, she was wearing only a summer 
dress, so she must improvise some winter protection for survival. Prob- 
ably the easiest way is to hunt the rabbits, but for players who cannot 
bear to make a coat out of the furry little creatures, Jenny instead can 
survive by chopping a great deal more firewood. 

The game sometimes seems to move along very slowly, but Rhian- 
non reports that extensive field research, including field tests on a 
Brownie troop and several elementary classrooms (with both boys and 
girls), has shown that children like the time to explore the computer and 
the game. 

Playing Jenny instills some basic computer skills, such as entering 
program commands and referring to documentation. There are no right 
answers to this game. Jenny explores apple orchards, fishing streams, 
berry patches, wheat fields, and a meadow in her quest for survival. 
Rhiannon has also programmed surprise extras into its games to reward 
experimentation and logical thinking about computers and the real 
world. 

The graphics are purposely simple to encourage children to fill in the 
rest with imagination. Ever notice how a little girl can take a doll and 
play with it for hours? Giris can take Jenny, a sort of computer-age doll, 
into the simple landscape for their own imaginaUve adventures. 

Rhiannon made the character of Jenny self-sufficient without mak- 
ing her a supergirl stereotype. She cannot defend herself against all the 
dangers (how many young children could?), so she has to run away from 
some of them. Jenny is smart — it's up to the computer user to get her 
away fast. If she doesn't get away fast enough . . . well, the game is over. 
This is supposed to be like real life. 

And Jenny is very much a real child. If she forgets to pick up the fish 
after she catches it, she doesn't get the fish. A nice touch is the artist's 
rendition of Jenny on the package material: Her hair is messed up — just 
a little. Any little gid, having to run away from rattlesnakes and coyotes 
and chop logs and build fires and fight blizzards, is going to get her hair a 
bit messed up. Jenny is like a real girl. 

Jenny has time for a few extra pleasures. If she's careful and ap- 
proaches it very slowly, she can make friends with a wild fox. And, at the 
end of the game, when Jenny has all her provisions stored for the brutal

winter ahead and all the survival tasks completed, she can pick some 
flowers to decorate her shelter. There's a surprise for Jenny if she picks 
and carries twenty flowers back to her shelter. 

The game was designed for girls ages seven through twelve. Younger 
players might need help reading the text, so family participation is en- 
couraged. Older girls who have already played more advanced adven- 
ture games might find this one slightly tedious; but, as an introduction to 
computers and computer games, Jenny of the Prairie is super, and it's 
bound to be a catalyst for some female computer geniuses. 

Three levels of play provide a variety of playing strategies and more 
intricacies to keep players interested while they become more computer- 
sophisticated. As they grow, so does their friend Jenny. 

Jenny has a lot of choices. Thanks to Rhiannon, now little girls do 
too. tin

Super Speed Reading. By Art Carpet. Experiments in using the com- 
puter to increase reading speed have generated some good tricks, but the 
fact is that increasing your overall reading speed significantly and mak- 
ing it stick requires books. Not computer screens, but old-fashioned oak 
and pine pulp. 

Super Speed Reading incorporates the best of the computer's capa- 
bilities to guide you and time you and help you read books fast — and 
magazines and newspapers and business reports and other paper 
products. 

The program is based on methods developed by J. Carson Kovar 
during more than twenty-five years of teaching speed reading. 

The method centers on using a device to help you move your eyes 
quickly down each page with as few stops as possible — at best none. Su- 
per super-speed readers merely flick their index fingers at the top corner 
of each page. But the first step is to quit reading word for word, to quit 
saying each word to yourself as you read. So this method first has you 
train your eye to stop only three times, then only two, per line and get 
your lips and throat to quit working. 

Super Speed Reading takes good advantage of the computer to en- 
courage you. First, the program presents the theories and methodology 
in an interesting and attractive way, full of interaction. Then it provides 
you with tools for keeping track of your progress and for timing yourself 
while you're working. 

The best tool, though, might simply be the computer itself — and its 
nonjudgmental insistence that you continue reading. When the comput- 
er presents Tom Sawyer with a pacer to keep you reading, the pacer, a 
thin horizontal strip of paper drawn vertically down the page, won't wait 
for you to catch up. You set your pace and it relentlessly holds you to it. 

The program suggests you warm up each day with five minutes of the 
computer text (yes, Tom Sawyer) and the computer pacer or pencil mov- 
ing you along. Then it insists that you practice on real books of your 
choice. You can do that anywhere, reporting the results to the program, 
or you can let the computer time you. The program figures out your 
speed based on its own timing and your page reports. 

Using the computer as a timer works beautifully. You enter the num- 
ber of the page you begin on, set the timer, and read. The program is 
considerately designed to give you plenty of flexibility. Do you like to 
push yourself and get fast feedback? Set the program to buzz you every 
five minutes (or every minute) for input, and try to beat each five-minute 
time with another five-minute read. Would you rather read a good hunk 
in peace and quiet? Set the timer for an hour or more. You can opt for 
the metronome to tick as you read — you tell it the pace you expect to 
read at and it ticks at what should be two-line intervals. Or you can tell it 
to get lost. 

When time's up, the program asks if you read for the entire time, so 
that if you've been interrupted and actually read for only ten of the fif- 
teen minutes it was set for, you haven't lost the entire session. Then it 
asks how many pages and how many lines beyond that you've read. Im- 
mediately upon receiving your answers, it responds with your reading 
speed in words per minute for that sesssion. 

The idea is to save the results of that and other sessions so that you 
can see a record of your improvement. You can see it in bar chart form if 
you like, just for the asking, or in a simple record.

When you become fast enough and proficient enough, you can go 
back to the teaching disk to learn even more esoteric means of super- 
speeding. It's possible, they say, to read and comprehend a novel in the 
time it takes to turn the pages. 

Super Speed Reading comes in a high-quality suedelike binder, with a 
manual that appears, from the first few pages, to be excellent. But who 
wants to read manuals? (Maybe after you finish the course. . . .) Besides, 
you don't need to. You can boot up this program and delve into 
your study and practice; the disks are self-prompting and their content is 
exquisitely clear and logically organized. 

For most of us, learning to speed-read is something we'd like to have 
done but never quite have the time to do. Super Speed Reading brings the 
professional process home; and, because it's so well done, it behaves a lot 
like a spoonful of sugar. n(T

I.Q. Baseball. By M. Carasik. Baseball trivia games have been mar- 
keted before, but none has been lavished with as much detail as LQ. 
Baseball. The game begins with a hi-res flag waving while the national 
anthem plays. If that doesn't get you into the baseball mood, wait till you 
hear the crowd noise and the sounds of vendors hawking hot dogs and 
popcorn. 

The game can be played as competition between two people or 
against the computer. When it's your team's turn at bat, the pitcher 
pitches the ball, then the game freezes while a multiple-choice question 
appears. If you answer correctly, the batter runs the bases. Easy ques- 
tions earn singles; harder questions rate doubles and triples. Answering a 
really tough question scores a home run — with much fanfare. When the 
batter rounds home plate, a teammate runs out from the dugout and 
gives you a "high five" congratulation. Missing a question is an auto- 
matic out. 

When the computer's at bat, your pitches bring questions to you. If 
you can answer them, the computer strikes out; otherwise, the computer 
gets a hit. The computer's line-up is a lot tougher than yours, with strong- 
er hitters. When a computer batter hits, he often scores a triple or home 
run. Beadng the computer can be quite a challenge. 

The play of the game follows normal baseball rules, but Davka has 
added some clever realistic touches. Occasionally, an apparent base hit is 
caught by a figure who runs into the infield and snags it, while the com- 
puter says, "I wuz robbed!" If you get really hot in an inning, organ mu- 
sic pipes up to cheer your drive on. Get too many runs and the comput- 
er pulls its pitcher and sends in relief! Randomly, the game may even be 
called for rain, which pours down on the field. 

While all these touches make the game delightful, it's the trivia ques- 
tions that give it its great playability. These questions are tough! For- 
tunately, there are two skill levels — designated minor and major 
leagues — but all questions deal with regular season baseball in the Na- 
tional and American leagues, spanning the entire history of baseball. 

LQ. Baseball doesn't end with the baseball season, and enjoying it 
doesn't have to end when you become too familiar with its large selec- 
tion of questions. Davka plans twenty-seven disks of supplemental ques- 
tions, each to be devoted to trivia questions about a specific team. And it 
plans a special comprehensive World Series disk of even more challeng- 
ing questions. I.Q. Baseball will do much to lessen those winter with- 
drawal symptoms till spring training. RRA

French Hangman, Latin Hangman, Spanish Hangman. By George 
Eari. Softalk has been remiss in not making you aware of George Earl's 
educational hangmen before. French and Spanish have been available 
for some time. 

Latin Hangman is a brand-new, and, for anyone fortunate enough to 
live in a community that still recognizes the classical languages and smart 
enough to take advantage of it, it's a marvelous tool. No better than the 
romantic hangmen — only much more unexpected. 

George Earl's hangmen play the traditional game, except that they 
tell you right out what's to go in the blanks — in another language. C'est

with Calami tas virtutis occasio est. Hmmm. 

Come back, all you French and Latin students of five or fifty years 
ago. Well, did you solve those two? Don't feel bad. George Earl's hang- 
men are terrific for students, but there's a whole league of closet users who 
just think they're a ton of fun. See, the programs work just like hangman. 
You guess letters. So, when /mje fille is so familiar but just beyond that 
little twist In memory, put a couple of letters in and you've got it! Such a 
memory. If you become a closet addict too, don't tell anyone, just enjoy. 

The fact is, you can learn or relearn a lot about languages from these 
packages. There are sections to study the vocabulary and syntax before 
you play the game. (Closet addicts never look at these first. They take 
their memory trials straight.) They're well done, and using the computer 
to learn them really is the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine of 
learning go down. 

But the games are the neat part. You can choose from among sever- 
al configurations, or do them one after another: vocabulary (individual 
words), English to other language, other language to English; sentences 
(the whole ball game!), English to other language, other language to Eng- 
lish. There are also several levels of configuration. 

Incredibly, the sentences and words are interesting. There's little of 
"The pen of my aunt is on the table" (in French, please?) or "The boy is 
a soldier from Gaul" (Latin scholars, groan in unison). Instead, try these: 

La solitude est a i esprit ce que la diete est au corps. 

Es feo, por otro lado. es rico. 

Non semper facilem habet felicitas aurem. 

J'ai mal a la tete. Ou sont les cachets d' aspirines? 

Me hace dano la comida picante. 

In cavea minus bene canit luscinia. 

Regardez-vous la television pendant que vous etudiez? 

Tiene su blusa puesta al reves. 

In vino, in ira, in puero semper est Veritas. 

In the French and Latin games, the words to be translated and the 
letters you type in are in big, bold, pleasing hi-res type, complete with ap- 
propriate accent marks. All the games keep an on-screen record of your 
percentage of accuracy for that round. (Closet players: ignore it.) 

The wonderful thing is that when you get done with the disk, you've 
learned a whole lot of another language. Child or adult, it's the same. 
Combining these very well done programs with a language class would 
seem an unbeatable move. tt(T

Space Station Zulu. By Dennis Shields. Avalon Hill's latest is a good ex- 
ample of a perfectly acceptable game being overshadowed by a superior 
predecessor. That's not unusual — except that in this case both games are 
recent releases from the same company. 

Like its forerunner, Space Station Zulu is a tactical combat game in 
which players defend their home against carnivorous aliens. The pro- 
tagonists are a peace-loving race called Yargs and live in an orbiting 
space station. There, life is cozy for the eleven active crew members and 
the thirty-two in a cryogenic sleep, until the day an alarm sounds. Inves- 
tigation leads to awful discovery. Apparently, an exploring party brought 
back a stowaway alien life form that slips out and begins infesting the 
ship. That's bad news, but worse yet, the stowaway likes the taste of 
Yargs! You are the station commander and must organize your sleepy 
crew to become a tough fighting force before the aliens eat you for 
dinner. 

If the scenario of Space Station Zm/m sounds vaguely familiar it comes 
as no surprise. There was once a vaguely similar movie. In addition, Ava- 
lon Hill's own recently released The Alien bears more than a passing like- 
ness. Unfortunately for Zulu, the comparison is not a favorable one. In 
The Alien, the characters all had their own unique personalities and ca- 
pabilities, but in Zulu they are a bland, homogenous bunch. Only one 
new character type is introduced, Mr. T-like robots who are more than a 
match for adult aliens. 

The aliens have reproduction on their side, however. In youth, they 
appear as spores, which can be stamped out by stomping on them; in 
adolescence, they appear as larvae and become harder to kill; and as 
adults, they become semi-intelligent and more dangerous yet. When not 
eating crew members, the adults occupy themselves by spreading spores. 

Game play consists of strategically positioning your robots and Yarg 



crew members where they can best combat the aliens. The player may 
move, retreat, search a room, defend himself, or attack u.sing his choice 
of weapons and battle strategy. Of course the optimum strategy is to 
catch the invaders as weak spores and prevent their adulthood. 

Successful weapon deployment is also crucial to winning. Weapons 
are scattered about the ship and each has a different effect on the mon- 
sters. Some weapons do damage, .some do nothing, and a few actually 
cause the monsters to grow! Because weapon effectiveness is randomly 
determined at the start of each game, players never know the effect of a 
particular weapon until they use it. One weapon, however, always works. 
Robots set to self-destruct will destroy everything in the same room, but 
their loss may hinder future play. 

In Zulu, there are three levels of play; normal, difficult, and little 
hope. Unlike the movie, no escape pod exists for when things get rough. 
Victory is determined solely by the elimination of one species. 

Although not a bad game, Zulu suffers because it isn't as exciting or 
playable as its older sibling. The Alien. In addition, the game's well- 
meant comic elements never seem completely appropriate. Space Sta- 
tion Zulu would serve best as a training ground for people trying their 
first computer simulation. Students of strategy could learn techniques 
and enjoy themselves simultaneously. It's just too bad, though, that Ava- 
lon Hill had to sabotage this decent entry with too many variations on 
the same theme. Will)

Prime Plotter. By Eli Argon. Prime Plotter is serious about creating fine 
graphs, charts, and graphic demonstrations. Not only can it draw line, 
bar, and pie charts, but it can combine these with text and drawings to 
present slide-show-like ongoing displays, and it can intermix text, draw- 
ings, and graphs on one page for display via screen, printer, or color 
plotter. 

There's a menu-driven system of modules for almost every conceiv- 
able need. Just in case your need is inconceivable, a module can be writ- 
ten for a specific task and added to the system. Flexibility is the hall-

mark of this package: Just about every parameter is user-definable. Quite 
a variety of effects can be achieved merely by selecting different modules 
or altering various parameters. 

Once you've entered data to be plotted, more sets of data can be 
created through mathematical and statistical formulas or from subsets of 
other sets. Then, when you've selected modules and set parameters to 
establish the kind of graph you want, you can place labels and any other 
information, even pictures, on or around the graph. Another graph can 
be drawn on a fresh screen, superimposed on the old graph, or even 
drawn in a corner of the screen. 

If anything turns out wrong, you can change it. Everything is flexible. 

At the core of the system is a program that keeps track of (and saves) 
all your selections; you can review what you've done and remove from, 
add to, or change it. With this feature, you can create records of several 
graphs and have the computer replay the instructions within a demon- 
stration program — also provided — that re-creates and displays screen 
after screen. You could work up a demonstration with text, drawings, 
and graphs to depict Northeast sales, for example, and run it at a board 
meeting or as a perpetual promotional display. 

Prime Plotter doubles as a general graphics tool. There are modules 
for drawing with lines or with Applesoft shape tables. In the pack- 
age are several character sets and shape tables of figures and even of elec- 
trical components. Of course, you can add other shape tables — flexibil- 
ity, right? — or create new character sets. Still other modules interface 
with DIP files, graphic printer cards, and plotters. 

Often, only the author and a dedicated few can run packages of this 
scope. But Prime Plotters menus are fairly easy to grasp and impossible 
to crash, and help is available within the program. The extensive manual 
is well written, describing quite clearly every phase of the program. 

However, Prime Plotter is definitely a tool and not a toy. You can 
fiddle around with graphs and pictures after only fifteen minutes, but fa- 
miliarity comes only with significant use. Prime Plotter is a carefully con- 
ceived, well-executed package for business or scientific applications that 
can benefit from its great power. AED(

Apple Cider Spider. By Ivan Strand. Has anyone noticed that a new cat- 
egory of computer games has lately sprung up? Yes, the industrial ar- 
cade game has become the wave of the future. Lately, these labor-inten- 
sive little wonders have been dragging us around mines, construction 
sites, and the like. Now it's time for the grand tour of the most unsani- 
tary bottling facility in existence. 

You, in the role of the title arachnid, are not the least part of this 
dubious distinction. As you wend your way up to the cider factory attic, 
you must dodge random frogs, thrushes, and hang-gliding wasps. While 
apples are plunking down chutes, getting cored, pared, diced, juiced, and 
bottled, you are hopping nimbly amongst the conveyor belts, making use 



oi' convenient prehung webs dangling from strategic places to make your 
way to the top of each screen. 

The mechanical layout of each .stage of cider production is satisfy- 
ingly arcane. The trick is in the precision of your jumping and famil- 
iarity with the layout of each screen. Sometimes you can just come close 
to a web and the program will patiently jerk you back and firmly place 
you on it before you can sail off into oblivion; other times you can be 
called out for so much as grazing your antennas on the ceiling. 

The beginning titles and end sequences open up new horizons of Cute 
in computer gaming. 

Nevertheless, it will be tough for Apple Cider to compete with its 
hard-hatted, '49-mining, lode-running competition for two reasons. To 
begin with, it has three (3) screens. This is no sin. A game with three real- 
ly good, challenging game screens with a wealth of strategic possibilities 
beats a game with several dozen mediocre ones. Unfortunately, the path 
through the industrial maze of each of the Cider scenarios is preset. In 
each case, there is only one way to go. Try a different path and you will 
suddenly start overshooting your jumps for no apparent reason, and 
seemingly solid footing will become inexplicably intangible. And while 
getting there is much easier seen than done, there's not much point in 
doing it twice. 

So what we have here is a nonviolent (save for observance of the laws 
of nature and gravity), conscientiously charming, well-programmed lit- 
tle game, designed in such a way as to limit its potential for repeat play as 
much as possible. A(

VIS\Bridge/SORT. One of VisiCalds major weaknesses is its inability 
to sort data. VIS\Bridge / SORT is a utility that allows you to sort either 
rows or columns of a VisiCalc template. Your template must be com- 
plete; then you must set it up to be sorted. This involves entering special 
codes that allow VIS\Bridge/ SORT to determine which columns or 
rows to sort. You can even set up a secondary sort priority. You then 
save a DIP version of the file, quit VisiCalc, and run VIS\Bridge/ 
SORT. The program uses a simple menu from which you determine the 
file that's to be sorted and whether it's to be sorted by row or by column. 
VIS\Bridge/SORT is a useful addition to a VisiCalc library. \S

Setting out in the tropical morning with a yellowed map, the adven- 
turer can accumulate clues and objects with ease — the solution seems 
within a baby's reach. However, as the day wears on, the barometer 
soars and the challenges increase. First you realize that some of your 
easily won possessions are being spirited away by a light-fingered ghost. 
Discovering the location of his cache is just one in a series of puzzles that 
make this adventure worthwhile. 

Next, the adventurer must reason his way past man-eating ants, 
quicksand, a zombie, fog, and enough red herrings for a public fish fry. 
And then there's the Maze. That's maze with a capital M. With the 
maze containing more than twenty-five turns, only a careful mapper will 
be able to find the exit. 

With maze navigated, the pressure is on. The three crucial maneu- 
vers of the game take imagination, a punster's mind, and a feel for the off- 
beat. This may leave strict disciples of logic feeling disappointed or even 
angered by the solution — and others may be frustrated by the two-word 
parser that can leave users playing word games. However, the adventure 
conceived by the brothers Hess is a good one and the graphics by Bar- 
bara P. Lawrence are lush and lovely, a gourmet's delight. 

So, mop your brow, ye brave adventurer, and take a voyage into the 
heat. You'll find it dangerous, frustrating, and fun. But ye wouldn't be 
leaving old Blind Pew behind, would ye, boys? Not old Pew! No!! 
Come back, boys! Come ba — (P 
Death in the Caribbean, by Philip and Bob Hess, Micro Fun, Micro Lab (2699

Compuquote. Compuqiwie is a program that is less interesting for what it 
does than for how it does it. But since it isn't going to sell on the merits of 
its input system alone, we can't ignore its purpose entirely. So let's get on 
with it. 

Compuquote is a cost estimation system for retail operations that pro- 
vide materials and services. Meaning simply that when you go to get 
your car repaired and ask how much it's going to set you back, they say, 
"Let's see. You're gonna need a new alternator, new calibrator, new dou- 
ble interlocking framistan jobber, total parts $245 (plus 10 percent for 
markup), take about three hours to put all that stuff in, about $60, and 
towing from the corner was $25 (you're lucky we didn't have to tow you 
from the other side of town), so that'll be about $330, plus 5 percent for 
the governor." 

Compuquote does that on the computer. It keeps a list of all the parts 
on hand and their prices, plus hourly rates for any kinds of services you 
might have available. So to produce a stunningly accurate, fast, and neat 
price quote that the customer will look at and say, "Oh my god," all you 
have to do is go in, select a few items, estimate a few hours of service, tell 
it to print, and there it is, fully itemized, complete with a dotted line to 
sign on. The sample data files on the disk are written for a fictitious com- 
puter store, but the play's the same no matter who the actors are: "Let's 
see. You're gonna need a new disk controller, some new RAM chips, 
and a new double interlocking framistan jobber He. . . ." 

Several additional options enhance the package. An item can have as 
many as five different per-unit prices. This is useful, perhaps even neces- 
sary, for wholesale operations. The quote can have a message stating 
how long it applies printed at the top and a comment of your choice 
printed at the bottom. Sales taxes and shipping charges are provided for 
too, of course. There are even options for arbitrary markups or dis- 
counts for least and most favorite customers. 

By now the suspense is killing you, isn't it? Just what is so special 
about how Compuquote works! It comes with a light pen. Not an ultra- 
sensifive, highly expensive light pen like you'd use for graphics, but a fair- 
ly cheap, lightweight, easy to install light pen. Just enough for the job at 
hand. 

The job at hand is selecting almost everything in Compuquote: items, 
markups, taxes, services, printing, saving, the works. Each item will have 
a white, cursor-shaped block next to it. When the pen detects that it is 
pointed at a block, all the blocks on the screen blink in sequence, fairly 
quickly. When the pen sees a light blink, it knows which cursor it's 
pointed at. The only things that need to be typed are the original price 
lists, file names, quantities, percentages, and that sort of thing. 

This method, when it works, can be as easy to use as Lisa's mouse. 
It's not without its drawbacks, however. Long persistence monitors, like 
Apple's Monitor III, tend to confuse light pens because the screen 



doesn't blink properly. Compuquote provides for this with a slower flash- 
ing rate, but the Monitor III sfill has trouble unless the brightness is 
turned uncomfortably high. If the light pen doesn't work right, there is 
no keyboard backup for any of its functions. 

Overall, Compuquote is well conceived. Its creators seem to have cov- 
ered most of the necessities of cost estimation. It seems a shame that the 
program doesn't also do actual invoices; the procedures would seem to 
differ only a little. The light pen approach provides much of the advan- 
tage of a touch-sensitive screen at a fraction of the expense. DD

North Atlantic '86. By Gary Grigsby. It's 1986, and the war in Europe is 

over. Russia has won. 

That bleak scenario is the opening for this operational level simula- 
tion depicting a Soviet versus NATO air, land, and naval battle. The 
prize is the North Atlantic and the significance is that this campaign is 
virtually the West's last hope. 

Like Gary Grigsby's previous games, Guadalcanal and Bomb Alley, 
this gigantic scenario is not based upon a war past, but one that we hope 
will never occur: World War III. 

The Soviet Union's attack floored the allies because it was carried out 
under the cover of Warsaw Pact maneuvers. Overnight, Germany was 
overrun, France declared neutrality, and the British and American 
armies were forced to evacuate to Great Britain. Meanwhile, operating 
from their newly acquired bases in Germany and Norway, the Soviet 
Union is preparing to strike again. NATO must struggle to run convoys 
through the Soviet air and naval blockade before Britain is starved into 
submission. In addition, the strategic Faeroe Islands and Iceland must be 
defended. If they fall, NATO must retake them at all costs. 

In North Atlantic '86, naval task forces are formed and deployed to 
project military power. Task forces may engage in combat patrol, sea line 
interdiction, and land bombardment. They can also supply and trans- 
port troops and can evacuate troops if the situation becomes hopeless. 

So detailed is North Atlantic '86 that every contemporary weapons 
system — ship, plane, and infantry company — available to the Soviet 
Union and NATO is included. Planes include the F15 Eagle, Harrier 
jump jet, C141 Starlifter, MIG 23 Backfire bomber, and CUB transport. 
Naval vessels range from the large American nuclear carriers Nimitz and 
Kennedy, battleships Iowa and New Jersey, to the new American and So- 
viet nuclear guided missile cruisers California and Kirov. In addition, a 
full complement of destroyers, submarines, and cargo ships rounds out 
the roster. The attention to detail is amazing, with actual real-life ships 
included by name and rated for combat capability, range, and fire- 
power. These powerful forces are all armed with the latest in smart weap- 
onry, including antiaircraft and air-to-air missiles such as the American 
Sidewinder and Soviet Atol. Even the deadly ship-killers first seen in the 
Falklands war — the American Harpoon, Soviet Styx, and the Exocet — 
are present. North Atlantic '86 is a chilling, plausible simulation of war in 
the all-too-near future. 

The gaming system includes two full campaign games and two mini 
games for those not prepared to make a career of North Atlantic '86. 
After all, the main campaign takes more than one hundred hours to 
complete. Needless to say, each game turn players may save a game in 
progress. 

During play, each game turn represents twelve hours, during which 
the player may build task forces, launch missiles and air squadrons, at- 
tack targets, and, at last, resolve combat. For all its incredible complex- 
ity and detail, Grigsby's game system is remarkably easy to learn and 
play. 

Graphics are similar to S.S.I.'s previous Guadalcanal and Bomb Alley 
and include a low-res color display of the North Atlanfic basin and a 
large grid depicting Great Britain, Norway, Western Europe, the Faeroe 
Islands, and Iceland. 

Play may be carried out on four difficulty levels and with either one 
or two players. In solitaire mode, the human always commands NATO, 
but rest assured, comrade, the computer opponent is plenty tough. 

The documentation is full, clear, and complete. One can only admire 
the level of research that went into this simulation. 

North Atlanic '86 is a superb simulation of a future NATO/Soviet 
conflict with a unique setting and background. The described Soviet vie-

new HP 7470A plotter does 
the communicating for you. 
Quickly. Logically. And with 
off-the-shelf software avail- 
able from most HP dealers. 

Fast and pretty. 

The 7470A gives you high plotting speed with excellent 
line quality ... faster than any competitive small plotter 
On top of all that, it comes in an attractive design 
package that looks nice on your desk. And it does it 
for only $1,095, (U.S.A. domestic suggested retail price.) 





Count on it. 

The 7470A is built the Hewlett- 
Packard way. To last. Designed and 
engineered with only a few parts, none 
of which require adjustment. And with 
customized integrated circuits 
that ensure reliability. 

Pen pals. 

The HP 7470A has 
two single-pen stables. 
Simple pen changes give you 
multi-color plots in your choice of ten 
coordinated colors. Pens are automatic-

From the people who gave you Math Blaster and Word Attack, two ex- 
cellent game-style teaching programs for children, comes a program for 
adults — or, more precisely, for readers of any age. This program is very 
different from the earlier ones, but it has two characteristics in common 
with them: elegant simplicity and teaching power. 

Speed Reader II is based on the fact that most people use the wrong 
set of habits to read with. Back when we were first learning to read, we 
had to examine each new word in a sentence, one at a time; so we got in- 
to the habit of reading that way and never changed it. This program con- 
sists of a set of exercises designed to help us change those habits. 

The problem (in simplified terms) is this: Your eyes have to be locked 
on to something — the technical term is fixated — before they can send de- 
tailed information to your brain. Thus the normal operating pattern of 
the eyes is to fixate on something, send a picture to the brain, and then 
move to fixate on something else. 

This cycle of eye activities — stop on a target, sharpen the focus, send 
a picture to the brain, move to the next target — takes time. The more of- 
ten you have to repeat the cycle in reading a sentence, the more time it 
will take you to read that sentence; thus, the slower your reading speed 
will be. 

The answer is obvious: If you can train your eyes (and your brain) to 
take in more words on each stop, you won't have to make so many stops 
in reading the sentence. That means you spend less time on each sen- 
tence; in other words, you read faster. 

And there is (sometimes) a rather surprising side effect: improved 
comprehension. You might think that reading faster means reading less 
carefully and that understanding suffers; but, in fact, the reverse is true. 
When this program was being tested, it produced speed increases to at 
least double the student's previous speed, with no loss in comprehen- 
sion; and sometimes comprehension improved along with speed. 

The program has three types of exercises to change your eye-move- 
ment habits. You start by improving your peripheral vision, learning to 
take in more at a glance. The program shows you larger and larger 
groups of letters (later, of words) for shorter and shorter periods of time, 
until you can take in four words widely separated across the screen in a 
fraction of a second. 

Next, you learn to read in groups of words, instead of single words. 
This is done with a narrow vertical column of text, two or three words 
wide: The task is to train your eyes to take in each line in a single glance 
(technically, with a single fixation). You've mastered this when you can 
read the column by moving your eyes straight down the screen, without 
going from side to side at all. 

Finally, there is an exercise that teaches you to read normal text in 
groups of words, rather than word by word. You learn to swing your 
eyes back and forth across the page, making two stops on each line. 

In addition to the exercises, the program includes a number of prac- 
tice passages of normal text with variable scan rate and other features to 
help you reshape your eye-movement habits and several reading speed 
and comprehension tests, which you can use to measure your progress. 

The process is not effortless, of course. It always takes effort to 
change your own habits, and the older they are the harder it is. But this 
program focuses that effort very sharply (that's where the "elegant sim- 
plicity" comes in; no wasted motions). It will show you distinct improve- 
ments after very little work. Of course, you have to keep practicing or 
the old habits will reassert themselves. 

The package includes extensive support material. On the pedagogi- 
cal side, there is a complete lesson plan, student record sheets, and a de- 
tailed explanation of the principles on which the program is based. On 
the programming side, there's a software editor (with an excellent tu- 
torial) to enable you to add text material of your own choosing (new les- 
sons, quizzes, and so on) to the program. 

In short, this program is a well-designed tool for a specific purpose. It 
is friendly to both student and teacher and it teaches effectively; you can 



watch yourself getting better, which is a great motivation to keep prac- 
ticing. If you need to improve someone's reading speed, or if you're Icjok- 
ing for a game to play against yourself, with useful side effects, check this 
one out. IP

The Assembler and MacroSoft. By Alan Floeter and Valerie Floeter. 
Have you ever wished for a machine language assembler that could 
understand Basic? Have you ever wished that there were a halfway step 
between Basic's slow but familiar operation and the high-speed gibber- 
ish of assembly language programming? 

The folks at MicroSparc have two items directed at just those needs: 
The Assembler and MacroSoft. The two packages complement one 
another MacroSoft is a library of routines that, when used with The As- 
sembler, allow you to generate machine language code from familiar 
Basic-like commands. 

The Assembler is a reasonably good assembly language tool in its 
own right. It includes a flexible, line-based editor, complete with com- 
mands to move or copy code from one place to another, search for and 
replace strings, and edit lines. The line-editing command allows you to 
clean up almost any mistake without having to retype the whole line. 
You can even control the speed of the screen's scrolling with paddle 0, a 
handy capability if you find yourself unable to read as fast as the Apple 
can print. 

The editing features of The Assembler aside, its main strength is its 
ability to handle macros. Macros are prewritten routines that are in- 
serted into the object code at assembly time in place of macro labels. 
Macros allow you to place assembly language routines in assembly lan- 
guage programs as single commands followed by their parameters. The 
macro definition tells the assembler what parameters to expect and what 
to do with them. A library of macro routines can reside on disk and 
automatically read into memory at assembly time. You could have a li- 
brary of string-handling commands, a library of mathematical func- 
tions, and a library of graphics routines that you could then use

IF YOU'RE CONFUSED 

ABOUT BUYING A 
PERSONAL COMPUTER, 

rSSONEHELB 




Computers come in two parts. 

One part is the "hardware!' the 
machinery itself. The other is the 
"software!' which tells a computer 
what to do, the way a driver teUs a 
car what to do. 

Without software, a computer 
can't do anything. And vice versa. 
You have to buy both. 
Buy the software first 

Since the reason you're buying a 
computer is to get the capability 
the software gives you (remember 
It's the software that teUs the com- 
puter what to do) , it makes good 
sense to pick the software first. 

Start by making a list of the 
things you want the computer 
to do. Possibilities include word 
processing, inventory control, 
accounting, graphics, recordkeep- 
ing— you name it, there's probably 
software that does it. 

Next take your list into a com- 
puter store and ask the salesper- 
son to demonstrate software that 
will do the things you want. 

Even though you'U need a com- 
puter for the demonstration, keep 
in mind the computer is just a 
vehicle. The software is the driver. 
Once you've decided on software, 
picking the rest of the computer 
system will be that much easier. 
The simpler the better. 

Some people will tell you that 
software has to be complicated to 
be powerful. Nothing could be fur- 
ther from the truth. 

Good personal software should 
be, as the computer people say, 
"fnendly." Meaning that it helps you 
do what you want to do without get- 
ting m the way. 

Good software keeps the com- 
plications in the computer, where 



they belong, And keeps the capa- 
bility at your fingertips. It's that 
simple. 

Simply see for yoursell 

You can read any number of 
interesting books and mag- 
azines about personal 
computers.You can 
ask your friends 
who have 
them. 




Or look 
at all 

the sales 
literature 
you can get 
your hands on. 

But as helpful as 
that can be, there's 
no substitute for a live 
demonstration. 

When you do go shop 
pmg, we recommend 
you take a look at 
thePFS" Family 
of Software. 

Designed 
the way we 
thmk a soft- 
ware family 
should be: 
sunple, 

straightforward 
and powerful. 



Currently there are four software 
packages in the family: PFS:WRITE, 
PFS:f ILE, PFS:REPORT and PES: 
GRAPH, with more on the way. 
Here's a little more about each of 
them. 

PFS:WRITE. The simplest way 
to get your message across. 

PFS:WRITE is ideal for people 
who want to make their writing time 
more productive. It displays what 
you write on your computer screen 
so you can make revisions as you 
compose. 

With WRITE , you can correct mis- 
spellings or substitute one portion 
of text for another, with just a few 
keystrokes. 

And when you're through revising, 
WRITE shows you "on-screen "just 
how your document will look 
when it's printed. So there 
are no surprises afterwards. 

WRITE also works with — 
most popular software pro- 
grams, including the PES 
Family of Software. 

This feature allows you to add 
names and addresses from mailing 
lists to generate form letters. Or 
combine columns of numbers or 
graphs with your text. 

PFS:FILE.The simplest 
^way to get organized. 

FILE is basically a paper filing 
I system without the paper. So 
you can record, file, retrieve 
and review information in a 
fraction of the time it takes with a 
conventional filing system. 

With FILE, you arrange your 
information on a "form" you design 
yourself. And when you need to 
track something down, FILE sorts 
through your records electronically 
It lets you retrieve information in a 
variety of ways so you can be as 
selective as you want. 

PES: REPORT. The simplest 
way to sum it all up. 

REPORT is a powerful analysis 
tool that works with FILE . 

REPORT sorts through your files 
and retrieves the information you're 
looking for. Then assembles it aU 
into one report, so you can analyze, 
plan and make better-informed 
decisions. 

REPORT is also good at math. It 
quickly sorts through columns of 
numbers and performs calcula- 
tions, so you won't have to.

PFS:GRAPH. 
The simplest 
way to spot trends. 

GRAPH is ideaUy suited for 
professionals who need charts or 
graphs in a hurry. 

All you do is specify the kind of 
graph or chart you want and enter the 
information. GRAPH does the rest. 

GRAPH transforms columns of 
facts and figures into pie, line and 
bar charts so you can spot trends 
quickly and make better-informed 
decisions. 

GRAPH works with PFS: / 
WRITE, PFS:FILE,VisiCalc® 
files or data entered directly 
into the computer. And sup- 
ports most popular printers and 
plotters.

in your assembly language programs. 

You could even have a library of Applesoft commands, which is 
exactly what MacroSoft is. Many assemblers handle macros, and a few 
come with libraries of macro routines, but the combination of Macro- 
Soft and The Assembler is the first system designed to act as a complete 
high-level language. And it is executed and documented well enough to 
pull it off. Almost all the Applesoft commands are mimicked by the 
MacroSoft library. Most of the macros are in effect no more than sub- 
routine calls to the correct locations in Applesoft ROM. This allows you 
to write with familiar functions and commands and, after assembly, have 
ready-to-run machine code. More or less preinterrupted Applesoft. 

Of course, this is not the end of your search for the perfect program- 
ming tool. And it's not a tool for beginners. Though the manual does 
start from ground zero, a good understanding of programming concepts 
is essential in order to use these tools properly. 

Although the code is significantly faster than good old Applesoft, 
there's a fair amount of inefficiency inherent in the generality of the rou- 
tines. The object code generated is longer than an equivalent Applesoft 
program. An experienced assembly language programmer could write 
better code, but certainly not as quickly. Besides, how many of us think 
with a vocabulary of three-letter words and digits 0 through F7 Macro- 
Soft makes a nice way station between Basic and assembly-level pro- 
gamming, and The Assembler is powerful enough to get the most 
out of it. AED(

The Quest. By Dallas Snell, Joe Toler, and Joel Ellis Rea. A wonderful 
romp through a medieval fantasy world, this hi-res adventure amuses 
players with one hand while picking their pockets with the other. Settle 
back and enjoy the story as it unfolds. 

Once upon a time there was a lovely kingdom named Balema. It was 
ruled by a wise and kind king. Gait the First. One day Lady Diane, a 
beautiful noblewoman from a distant southwestern province, burst into 
the king's throne room. She pleaded for aid from the king and begged 
forgiveness for not being able to pay the taxes then due. Lady Diane told 
a horrible tale of destruction and killing. It seems that a vicious dragon 
was laying waste to the whole countryside; many towns and villages had 
been destroyed. The king immediately ordered his champion, Gorn, to 
track the beast down and slay it. 

Bet you thought you were going to be Gom, the mighty slayer of drag- 
ons, huh? Nope. Instead, with a tip of the hat to A Connecticut Yankee 
in King Arthur's Court, you're the king's newest, very green adviser. The 
king decrees that you shall aid and assist Gorn in this valiant quest. Gorn 
is not excited. The king instructs Gorn to follow all your advice, but a 
look at the hot-tempered champion makes the prospects of his obedi- 
ence dubious. And so the two of you start off. 

The first stop is at the castle provisioner for supplies. A sign offers 
standard fare plus a few exotic items, but don't stop there. Not every- 
thing available is posted on the sign — and there's no returning to the pro- 
visioner. It pays to be well read. 

Leaving the castle opens up a colorful world. There are glens, water- 
falls, swamps, lakes, and labyrinthine caves. The vast kingdom (it's an 
extensive map) is well populated; there are bandits, skeletons, snakes, 
goblins, seers, and traders. There's even a transplanted Sphinx that will 
bar your way unless you can solve one of its famous riddles (no, the an- 
swer is not Man). And, of course, there's the small problem of the drag- 
on, which, after all, is the object of the quest. 

Water is crucial. Avoiding dying of thirst is a constant problem, but 
water sources are many and well spread out. Finding them and keeping 
easy access to them through careful mapping tames this issue to a more 
reasonable perspective. 

Be careful not to take everything at face value. Things that seem 
harmless may not be, and people may steer you in the wrong direction. 

Geared for intermediate adventurers. The Quest has several innova- 
tive features to encourage and make the game fun for beginners. Most of 
the puzzles and roadblocks have more than one solution. Consequently, 
there's none of the frustration, especially prevalent for beginners, of try- 
ing to figure out, "What on Earth does this *?#!!* machine want for an 
answer?" So cleverly is the use of multiple solutions carried out that it's 



seldom apparent whether there's an optimum solution to a particular 
puzzle. If it works, it's probably just fine.

Troeger Math Placement Guide. By Martin Troeger. The Troeger Math 
Placement Guide enables teachers to administer math placement tests and 
evaluate the results for many students without the burden of paperwork. 
The subjects enter their names at computers and answer a series of mul- 
tiple-choice questions. When students finish, the program instructs them 
to notify the teacher, who can gain access to their scores by typing a spe- 
cial control code. 

Seven levels of testing are provided; two pretests determine the best 
starting level for each student. When a number of the one hundred forty 
or so questions on a level are answered correctly, the program advances 
to the next level automatically, eliminating a lot of work on the teacher's 
part. However, a bright student could be at the computer a long time. 

Any of the questions may be modified or added to according to indi- 
vidual teachers' preferences. Also, short of students' pressing reset, ex- 
cellent error trapping prevents them from accidentally messing up a test 
in progress. EW

Stellar 7. By Damon Slye. It's been a long time since there was this kind 
of game on the market. 

The last time anything like Stellar 7 sprung up, it was called Horizon 
V. Stellar 7 is what Horizon V could have been, with a little help. 

It's a tank game with you in the driver's seat of an experimental ar- 
mored tank, the Raven. Though a complex story line accompanies the 
game, you don't really need it to have fun. Gir Draxon, Supreme Over- 
lord of the Arcturan Empire, Stalker Agrav Units, biphasal thunder can- 
nons, Warplink, gravitic scope, protonic shields. . . . These are all just big 
words to add a feeling of heroism to your task — destroying the enemy 
Arcturans and saving a defenseless Earth. 

Hmm. Sounds like every other space game. But it's not. 

Each level requires you to destroy a certain number of the enemy be- 
fore moving to the next level via Warplink (best described as a thing that 
transports you to the next star system when you run into it). Finding 
enemy vehicles isn't necessary; they'll find you. Luckily, the Raven is 
equipped with a radar that lets you know where all your opponents and 
other obstacles lie. In fact, you'll find it easier to navigate by your radar 
scope than by the view window, since it gives you 360-degree vision. 

The Raven is almost everything you need to blast your way to level 9. 
In addition to cannons and shields, it comes with Inviso Cloak, which 
makes the Raven invisible to the enemy, often confusing them as to your 
location. A zoom lens gives you a telescopic view of the terrain (the bet- 
ter to aim your cannons with), while a special scope makes shells and la- 
sers visible on your radar scope. 

As for graphics, they're done quite well. When you look at some of 
the more recent games around, it's hard to imagine someone even think- 
ing of writing one with black-and-white vector graphics (line drawings). 
When tanks rotate, they really look like they're rotating (don't miss the 
awesome mission briefing sequence) with a fine 3-D look. Movement of 
objects from side to side, from near to far, and vice versa is smooth. 

Most of today's popular worlds-at-war games are keen-looking simu- 
lations of things flying through the air, but how often do you actually 
control a vehicle from the outside, as these games have you doing? Stel- 
lar 7 is a crisp version of those popular tank games that let you control a 
vehicle from the inside. 

If you've never heard of Software Entertainment Company, don't let 
that fool you. It ranks right up there with this game. fITV

The no-template standstill seems to occur more often in financial 
planning than in other areas. Very few people understand financial plan- 
ning well enough to solve complex financial problems. The Financial

VisiCalc and Multiplan on the Apple II, provides the solutions to a num-

Secret Agent: Mission One. Patrick McGoohan never had it this tough! 

You are the secret agent in this spy adventure, and at every turn 
someone is trying to shoot you, poison you, or blow you up. The plane 
you're on goes into a tailspin before you're ten moves into the game. A 
haberdasher dashes out to shoot you because you copped a bow tie 
from his shop. And suddenly you realize that Secret Agent is the ulti- 
mate in what might be called the "Ha ha, you're dead" genre of 
adventure. 

Once again a megalomaniac is terrorizing the world. Hidden away on 
a remote island off the even remoter coast of Batangali, one Ruppert 
Melton, certified loony, plots to rule the world by Friday or else blow it 
up. His home-brewed superweapon, the Energy Synchronizer, can do the 
job. The weapon, a bit too large to hide in a Cracker Jack box, is pro- 
tected against encrosion on itself or its surroundings by an automatic fir- 
ing device. Any attack on the island fortress will set off the Energy Syn- 
chronizer and devastate the world. 

Your mission is to find Batangali, locate the island fortress, sneak 
ashore, overcome the guards and electronic traps, and deactivate the 
firing device — all within a few hours. Even Our Man Flint would have 
had trouble making the deadline. Assuming you survive the plane inci- 
dent, only ten or eleven other attempts on your life stand between you 
and the familiar sight of a Hilton hotel. Haven? Maybe. Now to just fig- 
ure out a way to reach the formidable island fortress of Dr. No (whoops, 
wrong movie!) and save the world. 

The hi-res graphics in Secret Agent are line outlines; no color fills are 
used. While this does allow crisper outlines, the pictures lack depth. 

The adventure itself has many very good moments; escaping some of 
the situations calls for plenty of ingenuity. Secret Agent is the first of a se- 
ries of spy adventures; if the stories maintain the quality of this one, it 
would behoove the creators to bring the graphics up to par.

Ramdisk He. By Richard Kraemer. A DOS is a DOS is a DOS. No? 
Well, not always. Sometimes a DOS is written to operate more than just 
disk drives. There are lots of different sized RAM cards around, and it 
seems that whenever you have a chunk of RAM that can't be used nor- 
mally by Basic, someone is tempted to fool DOS into thinking it's 
another disk drive. There have been pseudo-DOSs for RAM segments as 
small as 16K (the language card) and as large as 320K (the Axlon 
Ramdisk 320, perhaps the height of the pseudodisk art). 

Such an area of memory is the 64K resident on the Apple He Ex- 
tended 80-Column Text Card, and such a program is Ramdisk He, a 64K 
pseudodisk program for DOS 3.3 and Apple Pascal. Normally, you can't 
use that 64K from Basic without using some new and highly esoteric 
firmware calls; so it's a natural for pseudodisk use. Only a handful of 
new programs and new versions of old programs use the extra memory, 
and most of those are copy-protected anyway (meaning they probably 
have their own modified DOS, which will deactivate any pseudo-DOS 
when you boot them). In short, nearly anything you can run with the 
Ramdisk lie program active will not contend for any of that memory 
space. 

There are exceptions. For instance, the eighty-column card uses 1 K 
of the auxiliary bank. Ramdisk He thoughtfully does not use the text 
page — no conflict there. Double hi-res graphics requires 8K of auxiliary 
memory. Problems there? Yes, but not big ones. The default con- 
figuration tells Ramdisk He to use that 8K — after all, that's too big a sec- 
tion to waste on the off chance that someone might want double hi-res — 
but the instructions (which come on the disk with a provision for print- 
ing them out) tell how you can use a single poke to protect that 8K. They 
also include pokes for changing the slot to be emulated, disallowing 
eighty-column use, and so on. 

The advantages and disadvantages of a RAM-based pseudodisk are, 
in summary: It's a convenient and fast place to store programs and other 
files temporarily. For instance, when you're working on one program 
and need to run another program briefly, you can store one in the Ram-

just have to make sure that there's a slot parameter available for all disk 
commands. It's very useful for multiple program systems; Apple Writer 
I, for example, will fit neatly into the available space complete with all its 
supporting files. 

The only real disadvantage is that it isn't permanent storage the way 
a real disk is. It can serve as a data file backup for circumstances in which 
you might want to revert to an old version of a file, but as backup in the 
sense of saving a file in case of a system crash or power failure, saving a 
file on the Ramdisk He is no more useful than attempting to memorize it

The High Gods are searching for a replace- 
ment for IRandamn, the pxawerfui Demi-god of 
random events. 

Accept the challenge and you enter a uni- 
verse of randomness. There are 7 totally differ- 
ent worlds in Hi-res Graphictron animation, 
including the eerie Graveyard, ancient Stone- 
henge, and the piratical Undersea land. In each, 
it will take all your wits and skill to fight and 
think your way through 7 stages of ever- 
increasing difficulty. In each, 7 different kinds 
of opponents stand guard. But which ones 
you face depends on .... 



the spin of the 

Mystic 
Slot Machine! 




At all first-stages 
you fight a single 
randomly chosen 



enemy Survive, and the Mystic Slot Machine 
spins again, to turn up other randomly selected 
opponents .. until at each world's 7th stage you 
meet 7 at once. Which ones? The ghost? The 
cobra? The death birds? The devil's lightning? 
Ahhhh, since they carry the curse of Random- 
ness they may all be different —all the same— 
or a terrifying mixture. 



But win through, and 
your reward is great. You 
become a new Demi-god 
of the universe. Dare you chance it? Can 
you stand the agonizing suspense of the 
Mystic Slot Machine? Then welcome to 
Randamn .... where only you stay the same- 
all else is random!

yourself. For a pseudodisk with its own power backup — Axlon's 
Ramdisk comes to mind — you can expect to pay a considerable amount 
of money. 

Nevertheless, if you have that chunk of memory, Ramdisk lie can be 
a useful thing to have. There is a satisfaction to be had in having to wait 
less time for any disk access that is necessary but less than urgent. And as 
a value — that is, the amount of storage weighed against the price asked — 
Ramdisk lie beats the others hands down. DD

Square Pairs. By Glenn M. Kleiman and Steve Minsuk. You don't need 
a computer or software to play this game. Kids often make do with a 
pack of playing cards. But Scholastic's version takes the concepts a few 
steps further. 

Square Pairs is a flexible learning tool in the guise of a conventional 
match-the-boxes game. The computer screen shows the player a grid of 
numbered boxes. On each turn, you uncover two boxes; the goal is to 
find boxes that match. Matches can be direct matches (two identical 
things), opposites (floor, ceiling) or even two things that simply go to- 
gether (computer, disk drive). 

The game accommodates one or two players; there's even an option 
for one player to play alone or against the computer. 

Perhaps the most valuable feature of Square Pairs is its Game- 
maker utility. This is where toy becomes teacher. Children can use this 
utility to create their own pairs, using words or phrases they know, or par- 
ents can create games that teach general knowledge of relationships. For 
example, you can teach state capitals by creating such pairs as Al- 
bany/New York, Juneau/ Alaska, and so on. 

Square Pairs may be one of the first educational games that involve 
child and parent equally. As a game, it's challenging and stimulating; as a 
teaching tool, it lets the parent take an active role in the teaching process 
instead of just supervising the child as the game is played. 

The flexibility of the Gamemaker makes it possible to teach almost 
any subject short of quantum mechanics. And that's not an exaggera- 
tion. Creating new games is a completely open process; the information 
and the criteria for matching pairs is entirely up to you. Because of this, 
Square Pairs opens itself up to being more than an educational game just 
for kids. 

One nice feature is that the program assumes you know nothing. A 
brief manual takes you by the hand in setting up the game, selecting its 
options, and making suggestions for other possible games. 

It's nice to see an educational game that generates parental partici- 
pation without requiring someone looking over the child's shoulder 
every step of the way (remember how nervous that made you when you 
were trying to finish your arithmetic homework?). flTV

Ultra Rom Board. By Paul Johnson. Programming involves a lot of lit- 
tle tasks. The more you know about the computer, the more little, high- 
ly specialized tricks you know and need to know. Like converting num- 
ber bases between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal. Like finding the ad- 
dress and length of a binary file. Like determining how much space is 
left on a disk. And so on. You don't have to work at programming for 
long to develop a library of programs for these tasks. 

In most cases, however, it's a pain to use these routines when you 
need them most. At best, you have to find your utility disk and run the 
right program, which is a lot of trouble to go through to find out that 
$C8 equals 200. At worst, if the program you're working on and the util- 
ity are both in Applesoft, you have to save your work, load and run the 
utility, and reload your program. More often than not, you'll end up 
making the calculations by hand. Which is still kind of silly when there's 
a computer sitting in front of you. 

Hollywood Hardware has developed an elegant solution to this prob- 
lem: the Ultra Rom Board. This board has two ROM chips and six ex- 
tra sockets for expansion. The two chips that come with the board con- 
tain Neil Konzen's GPLE — a widely used editor for Applesoft that aug- 
ments the computer's built-in editor without replacing it and making you 
learn a whole new set of conventions right away — and a set of amper- 
sand routines that do a lot of those necessary little tasks you've done by 
hand until now. 



The board really gives you two different kinds of ampersand com- 
mands. Some are the kind you would use while you are programming, 
and others are the kind you would use in your programs. They call them 
runtime and immediate commands. The immediate commands include 
the tasks just discussed as well as a quick ASCII conversion, several dif- 
ferent memory searches (search memory for ASCII string, search mem- 
ory for hex string, search program for parsed string, search program for 
raw string, and so on), find himem or lomem, restore a program deleted 
with new or FP, and a few others. 

The runtime commands include print using and if-then-else. The 
print using is useful but not complete: It won't add commas to a num- 
ber, for instance, but it will align numbers by decimal point position and 
round properly, probably the two most needed features of print using. 
The other runtime commands substitute for a few of the more useful of 
the items in the peeks, pokes, and calls chapter of the Applesoft manual: 
turning on either hi-res screen without clearing it and clearing a text 
screen from the cursor to the end of the line or the page. 

GPLE has been reviewed in Softalk before, but released in this new- 
form, some of what was said bears repeating. GPLE makes editing an 
Applesoft program all that it should have been in the first place, and then 
some. It allows you to insert to or delete from the middle of a line, jump 
from the beginning to the end, jump to the first occurrence of a particu- 
lar character in a line, and so on. Or you can search an entire program 
for lines containing a certain string. All the regular Applesoft and DOS 
commands, list, run, load, and save, for instance, operate as usual. 

The "and then some" is the keyboard macro capability that GPLE 
gives you. Escape can be used with any other key to substitute for any 
string you would want to use frequently. The built-in macro table with 
the Ultra Rom Board includes some improvements over the original one 
from Synergistic. For instance, most of the DOS commands can be 
executed by moving the cursor up the catalog to the file desired and hit- 
ting two or three keys. The macros even take care of moving the cursor 
over the file name for you. 

The advantage of having all these things in ROM should be obvious. 
All you have to do is activate the slot that the card is in and all those ca- 
pabilities become available. No messing with disks, and activating the 
card doesn't even damage the program in memory. In fact, it doesn't 
even use any RAM at all unless you choose to create your own macros. 
Everything on the board is bank switched within the range of addresses 
accorded to that slot's I/O space. 

The six open ROM sockets on the board are there for future expan- 
sion, and Hollywood Hardware has plans for ROMs to fill these slots. 
Presumably, the programs on the new ROMs will be as well thought out 
as the ones already extant, but it's always advisable to buy — or not to 
buy — based on what's available now, not what's coming next week. For- 
tunately, in the case of the Ultra Rom Board, what's available now is 
worth it. DD

Cosmic Balance IL By Paul Murray. Wanted: Galactic ruler, no previous 
experience necessary. Long hours, imagination, and an Apple II required. 

If this description appeals to you. Cosmic Balance II may be the chal- 
lenge you've been seeking. A simulation of strategic operations in an in- 
terstellar culture. Cosmic Balance II takes up where Cosmic Balance I left 
off. There's even an option to resolve combat ship to ship using the Cos- 
mic Balance I game disk. 

The object of this sequel is to discover, colonize, and develop new 
worids in the galaxy while defending yourself against hostile human or 
alien empires. To accomplish this, you must manage a sophisticated ga- 
lactic economy, govern the people, maintain defense, discover new 
worlds, organize commerce, and conduct scientific research. In the event 
of war, whole fleets of spaceships may have to be designed and built. 
Flash Gordon, eat your heart out! 

Containing five scenarios with unique settings and requirements for 
victory. Cosmic Balance II is not some simple space version of the classic 
city-state game of Hammurabi. In this richly detailed simulation, up to 
four planet types exist, including industrial, mining, farming, and terran 
worlds. In addition, each world has its own economic status ranging 
from newly discovered to fully active. Provision has even been made for 
ecolapse, an economic disaster that would plunge an entire world back to

Softerm provides an exact terminal emulation 
for a wide range of CRT terminals wfiich interface 
to a variety of liost computer systems. Special 
function l^eys, sophisticated editing features, 
even local printer capabilities of tfie terminals 
emulated by Softerm are fully supported. Softerm 
operates with even the most discriminating host 
computer applications including video editors. 
And at speeds up to 9600 baud using either a 
direct connection or any standard modem. 

Unmatched file transfer capability 

Softerm offers file transfer methods flexible 
enough to match any host computer requirement. 
These include character protocol with user- 
definable terminator and acknowledge strings, 
block size, and character echo wait, and the 
intelligent Softrans™' protocol which provides 
reliable error-free transmission and reception of 
data. The character protocol provides maximum 
flexibility for text file transfers. Any type file 
may be transferred using the Softrans protocol 
which provides automatic binary encoding and 
decoding, block checking with error recovery, and 
data compression to enhance line utilization. 
A FORTRAN 77 source program is supplied with 
Softerm which is easily adaptable to any host 
computer to allow communications with Softerm 



using the Softrans protocol. 

Softerm file transfer utilizes an easy to use 
command language which allows simple defini- 
tion of even complex multiple-file transfers with 
handshaking. Twenty-three high-level commands 
include DM/., CATALOG, SEND, RECEIVE, 
ONERR, HANGUP, MONITOR and others which 
may be executed in immediate command mode 
interactively or from a file transfer macro com- 
mand file which has been previously entered 
and saved on disk. 

Built-in utilities 

Softerm disk utilities allow DOS commands such 
as CATALOG, INIT, RENAME, and DELETE to be 
executed allowing convenient file maintenance. 
Local file transfers allow files to be displayed, 
printed, or even copied to another file without 
exiting the Softerm program. Numerous editing 
options such as tab expansion and space com- 
pression are provided to allow easy reformatting 
of data to accommodate the variations in data 
formats used by host computers. Softerm sup- 
ports automatic dialing in both terminal and file 
transfer modes. Dial utilities allow ap/ione/wo/fof 
frequently used numbers to be defined which are 
accessed by a user-assigned name and specify

development status. To further complicate matters, you must constantly 
acquire starships that range from simple one-man fighters to huge 
dreadnoughts and colony transport ships. Each vessel is separately rated 
for size, range, cargo, and combat values. This extensive level of detail 
supplies a sophisticated backdrop for the action to follow. 

The player must use his planets' resources to build additional star- 
ships while maintaining established worlds. Then, as new planets are dis- 
covered and colonized, you must create commerce nets to link interde- 
pendent industrial, mining, and farming planets together. To safeguard 
the newly discovered worlds, and provide an escort for the merchant 
fleets, war ships must be constructed and deployed. War is incredibly 
wasteful, so consider carefully before launching an attack on a neighbor. 
The cost of war could bankrupt your fledgling empire! 

Graphics displays in Cosmic Balance II are reserved solely for the 
colorful hi-res maps available to players. Text displays are used during 
game play to demonstrate the ongoing status of ships, planets, and cur- 
rent deployment. With more than four hundred star systems and forty 
habitable planets in the sixteen sectors of your small corner of the galaxy, 
the player needs constant updates. Battle sequences undertaken without 
Cosmic Balance I are resolved by the computer and consist of a non- 
graphic running commentary with notification of contact and battle 
results. 

Cosmic Balance II brings strategic gaming to a new and vast arena. 
As you discover untrodden worlds, colonize them, and use their re- 
sources to expand, remember that to win at this game you've got to be 
shrewd and daring — a leader in peace as well as in war. For as the say- 
ing goes, "The meek shall inherit the earth, the rest of us will go to the 
stars!" WUU

Jeepers Creatures. By Spencer Orelove, George Hoffman, and Joseph 
Prieboy. Jeepers Creatures is not a game exactly, nor does it masquerade 
as dry educational software. You don't win, lose, or solve puzzles. How- 
ever, it does amuse the little ones, and that is the express purpose of Jeep- 
ers Creatures. If anything, it's frivolous, and that isn't bad at all. 

Thirty colorful critters appear in three bands across the screen. When 
you tap a key, a new animal part is drawn in the band corresponding to 
the keyboard row you tapped. If you tap a key in the top row of alpha- 
betic keys, the beastie on the screen gets a new head. If you choose a key 
in the middle row, then a new torso appears. Guess what happens if a 
key on the bottom row gets mauled? 

Now remember, the rest of the creature does not change, just the cor- 
responding one-third. It doesn't take long to get some pretty weird-look- 
ing animals on the screen. For instance, a neat creature is the pencatroo, 
a hybrid of penguins, cats, and those pogo-sticking marsupials for which 
the newcoming publisher of Jeepers Creatures is named. 

Jeepers Creatures is nicely crafted. The animal parts always line up 
without overhangs or mismatched parts that make the animals into 
poorly carved totem poles. The names always fall together nicely at the 
bottom of the screen, using the most appropriate syllables of the ani- 
mals' names. The sound, while not complex, is not all that bad either — 
no mean feat for those who dislike the Apple's limited (when unaided) 
vocal abilities. Each time you make a complete and normal animal the 
program rewards you with a series of notes. 

This program is usable (and enjoyable) at any age, although it's 
geared toward the very young. In many senses, playing with Jeepers 
Creatures is like watching television, except that watchers get to change 
the stories anytime they want to by just tapping the keyboard. The pro- 
gram's quite imaginative and silly, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. 
It might well be the computer program most usable by the youngest peo- 
ple; it's quite easy to picture a toddler gleefully seated in front of the com- 
puter, amused for hours upon hours. t)A

Round About. By Ray Giarratana, a.k.a. Gumby Bitworks. Playing Round 
About is a little like playing Threshold whik rotating the television moni- 
tor. The object of the game is the typical arcade golden rule: Blast the 
enemy ships off the face of the universe (clear the screen) before they do 
likewise unto you. However, unlike many of the typical home-arcade 



games sprouting up like so many mushrooms, this one has some inter- 
esting angles. 

Your ship, the starship Roundabout, isn't confined to the top, bot- 
tom, or middle of the screen but moves along all four sides, firing its pho- 
ton torpedoes toward the center of the screen. Each torpedo has a range 
limited to roughly half the screen distance. 

Traveling in squadrons made up of identical ships, the enemies ma- 
terialize on-screen and fly about in high-speed zigzagging formations. 
Each of twenty-four levels introduces a more challenging swarm of at- 
tacking foes than the one before. 

The alien attackers, who appear as highly animated and colorful 
shapes, don't fire; they're satisfied with ramming your starship. Their un- 
predictable formations and high-speed flight paths make evasion and at- 
tack most difficult tasks. 

To further confound and challenge the arcade enthusiast, your adver- 
saries periodically bring along two buddies that attack independently. 
The first, a happy-faced killer that stalks your ship with unrelenting per- 
sistence, materializes and dematerializes randomly. The second, a whirl- 
ing dervish type that appears only after level six, bounces around the 
screen at such high speeds that avoiding it seems nearly impossible. 

Besides the three ships with which you start each game and an end- 
less supply of torpedoes, bonus ships are awarded at levels four, ten, and 
eighteen. 

The sound effects are quick, blend in well with the action, and are put 
to good use in maintaining the fast pace of the game. 

Another nice touch offered in Round About is a series of cartoonlike 
graphic interludes offered at intervals after level six. 

Gumby Bitworks may be an unconventional name for a game pro- 
grammer, but Round About proves once again that in gaming "the play's 
the thing." HAS

Vindicator. By Jimmy Huey. Tired of all those nonviolent arcade games? 
Frustrated with long, involved directions that you have to read before 
you can play the game? Poor thing. H.A.L. Labs understands. It's provid- 
ed, for your joystick's pleasure, a whole disk full of very solid, very hand- 
some, wall-to-wall, robot-busting action. 

Keep moving, keep shooting, watch your energy level, and keep an 
open mind thoul bonus points. You move your good little robot 
through a field of eggs while blasting materializing squads of bad little 
robots before they can blast unto you. Though the eggs are impervious, 
they are sought after by nasty pterodactyl-types that attempt to put the 
snatch on them while you are otherwise engaged. If you don't nail one in 
flight, it will release your pudoined egg at the top of the screen, from 
whence it must surely plummet to a horrible omelet. 

But wait! From across the screen you dispense with an encroaching 
pack of attackers with a mighty burst of multidirectional disruptor fire, 
race the length of the screen, and catch your falling egg without a mo- 
ment to spare, for a big 500 bonus points. 

As the levels — yea, measureless to man — mount ever higher, one en- 
counters the full complement of malevolent arcade types. It starts to look 
like an automaton convention and they seem to be materializing every- 
where you're not. There is also an indestructible little red delivery truck 
that barrels in and purposefully mows you down if it thinks you've 
stayed in one place too long. But be warned Unless you're already very 
good at this sort of thing, you will likely never witness the full variety of 
the local fauna in anything but demo mode — for you, it'll be three levels 
and out, tops. Those of you who are already this good (or are starting to 
think about your Christmas shopping for people you know who are) will not 
be underexerted or disappointed. 

This isn't exactly a ground-breaking game, any more than Octopussy 
is Cries and Whispers. It draws on the old reliables of arcade show biz 
and satiates your left-brain's need for vivid color and movement. It does 
its job like a pro and it knows when to get off. 

In computer games, the sheer craftsmanship of programs such as this 
will always ensure them a place as software salt of the earth; eternal and 
unbending; the solid rock upon which the eye-hand coordination of a 
generation is founded. A(

Applesoft as a First Language 



Learning your first computer language is like learning your first hu- 
man language. The first language you speak affects your view of the 
world; your first computer language shapes the way you think about pro- 
gramming. The study of Applesoft programming is really two things: the 
study of Applesoft and the study of programming. This is not just a glib 
truism designed to get you to read further — though it is that too — but an 
important distinction. 

Some things you'll learn in this column will only be relevant to Ap- 
plesoft. However, you'll also learn concepts that will help you when 
you're learning to program in other languages. It's useful to be con- 
scious of whether things apply to Applesoft or to programming when 
you learn them so that you won't have to duplicate a lot of effort 
later on. 

Apple's Native Tongue. Learning Applesoft is akin to learning vo- 
cabulary and grammar. Now don't say that you hated studying vocabu- 
lary and grammar in school, because you didn't learn them in school. 
Without being aware of it you learned most of that stuff long before you 
went to school. You learned it because everyone around you was talk- 
ing all the time and you didn't want to be left out. You were rewarded in 
the way that meant the most to you at the time; you were given atten- 
tion. Like many things, languages are easy to learn if you have the 
motivation. 

There are many reasons to learn a programming language. You can 
get a lot more out of your computer if you know how to tell it what to do 
in a way it understands. Say you have a task that is perfect for the com- 
puter to do — any information work that is repetitive, time-consuming, 
dull, or all of the above. Unfortunately, many such tasks are so special- 
ized that no commercial program exists to perform them. If you can 
write your own program, you'll find that a few hours spent now can save 
ten times as many hours in the long run. 

Now sometimes, when you've written such a program, you'll find out 
that maybe the task wasn't as specialized as you thought. All your friends 
say they need the very same thing. And maybe a publisher will realize 
that, and you'll be able to sell that program (to the publisher; you would 
give it to your friends, of course). This doesn't happen every day, but it 
does happen. 

Burning the Midnight RAM. There's another good reason to learn 
programming that is actually much more immediate than doing work or 
making money. Programming is fun. Once you get into it, you'll prob- 
ably find yourself spending hours writing programs that have no practi- 
cal value at all, just for the fun of it. A lot of people who see computers 
merely as useful tools are bewildered by programmers who work on into 
the night, oblivious to the needs for sleep and food. And a lot of pro- 
grammers are equally bewildered by normally frugal executives who pay 
them good money to do something they enjoy. 

So even if you can't think of a practical reason to learn Applesoft just 



now, don't worry; it'll come to you. 

Vocabulary and grammar in human languages correspond to com- 
mands and syntax in computer languages. You may wonder why pro- 
grammers feel the need to use jargon like this. Why can't they use the 
words vocabulary and grammar^. The primary reason is that commands 
and syntax have more exact definitions when applied to this field. Keep 
in mind that the words baste and saute were probably considered jargon 
at one time by people who didn't know how to cook. 

In Search of Unlimited Verbosity. So you've learned at least one 
thing already: Commands are the vocabulary of Applesoft. Actually, 
they're the verbs. Consider a verb in English. It can take numerous 
forms, and each form says a subtly different thing. It can describe ac- 
tions to be taken, actions that should be taken, actions that have been 
taken, actions that are being taken, and actions that would have been 
taken, to name only a few. The subject of the verb can be the speaker (I 
am), the listener (you are), or a person in the next room (she is). Notice 
how the verb changes in each case. You know English so well that you 
don't think about these complexities even though you use them every 
day. Applesoft is simple in comparison. It has no variation in verb form 
and the subject is always understood to be the computer. It only under- 
stands imperatives: Do this; if this is true, do that; understand this as 
meaning that. That's about as complicated as it gets. 

The fact that the only verbs the computer understands are com- 
mands is a revealing point: The computer is designed to do only what it is 
told. By learning Applesoft, which is much easier than the human lan- 
guage you already know, you can tell your machine to do things that no 
commercial program will do. 

If the commands of Applesoft are its verbs, then the syntax is the set 
of rules that describe how those verbs are put together with adverbs, di- 
rect objects, indirect objects, and prepositional phrases to make state- 
ments. Statements are the sentences of Applesoft. The other "parts of 
speech" have functional equivalents in Applesoft but no individual 
names. They are sometimes collectively referred to as parameters. More 
precise definitions of these terms can wait until we can give some 
examples. 

The study of Applesoft can be thought of as the study of how com- 
mands are put together with the required and optional parameters using 
the correct syntax to make statements. Statements are put together to 
make programs. 

What, then, is programming? How is learning to program distin- 
guished from learning Applesoft? If Applesoft is the vocabulary and 
grammar of the computer's language, then programming is composition. 

Any complex composition can be summarized in some kind of short- 
hand. One form of shorthand you're probably familiar with, even if 
you're not usually inclined to use it, is the outline. An outline of this ar- 
ticle, for instance, would be another way of expressing the concepts in the

necessary details — but it does indicate the overall structure at a glance.

1. saving time 

2. making money 

3. having fun 

B. Learning Applesoft

there's a device similar to an outline that can be ased to show the struc- 
ture of a program or routine. This device is called a flow chart. A typical 
flow chart is shown in the accompanying figure. You don't have to un- 
derstand the chart at this point; all you have to know is that it represents 
the structure of a moderately complicated program. Think of it as an 
outline of a set of tasks and decisions. 

All Good Metaphors Must Come To Pass. The differences between 
the flow chart and the outline demonstrate an important difference be- 
tween the structures used in writing articles and those used in writing 
programs. An article flows from beginning to end without diversion or 
interruption. Digression maybe. The indentations of the various items in 
the outline show the relative importance of and relationships between the 
topics. 

A program, interacting with the changing states of its own data and 
the information it receives from the outside world, flows quite different- 
ly, repeating some tasks, skipping others completely. The flow chart re- 
flects these interactions by means of rectangular task boxes, diamond- 
shaped condition boxes, and arrows indicating that in some situations 
the program must skip a section or return to an earlier section in order to 
operate properly. The whole shebang is more like human behavior than 
it is like a written language; a program responds. 

The m^phor linking computer languages to human languages be- 
gins to break down here. In a way this is good because you shouldn't feel 
that your ability to program is dependent on your ability to write. 
It's not. 

Algorithm, Who Could Ask for Anything More? The flow chart 
in this article can be described in linguistic terms. It shows an 
algorithm, a systematic method for solving a specific problem. There is a 
more specific mathematical deflnition for the word, but this has become 
its popular usage in computerdom. This flow chart illustrates the al- 
gorithm for a bubble sort, which is used for putting a list in sequence. 
You might describe the algorithm in English like this: 

You're looking at each item in the list and rearranging the list 
so that the items at the top will have the greatest values and the

those items or not, look at the second item from the bottom of the 
list and compare it with the next higher one up. Again, if the low- 
er item is greater than the higher item, switch their positions. 
Move up the list, continuing to compare and swap items until the 
top of the list is reached. Then, if any swaps were required in that 
pass through the list, go to the bottom of the list and do the whole 
thing over. If no swaps were performed, the list is in the correct 
order. 

The flow chart, once you understand it, is a more effective summary 
of the algorithm than the description was. The flow chart can use arrows 
to indicate where to go back to instead of the less precise description of 
"go to the bottom of the list and do the whole thing over." 

In Applesoft, we make it clear to the computer where we want to go 
back to or forward to within the program by using line numbers. A line 
number is a number identifying a line by giving it a unique name and in- 
dicating its position within the program. For now, we will define a line as 
a statement or a set of statements with a line number. (Yes, that is a cir- 
cular deHnition of a line. Please try to conceal your mirth.) 

Get Down and Boot Up. Much of the material in this column from 
now on will be easier for you to understand if you have the computer at 
hand and try things as we discuss them. First you have to get into Ap- 
plesoft. If you have an Apple II Hus or an Apple He with at least one 
disk drive, the most common Apple system, here's what you want to do: 

1 Insert the disk labeled DOS 3.3 System Master in your disk drive. 

2 Close the disk drive door. 

3 Turn on the computer and the monitor. 

4 Wait until the disk stops spinning and you have a right bracket ( ] ) on 
your screen followed by a flashing square. 



The "program" for getting Applesoft is shown as a four-step proc- 
ess. But what about people who have no disk drives? What about people 
who have older models of the Apple II without the Autostart ROM? 
They must follow different procedures. Let's look at a "program" for 
getting Applesoft that will work on a number of different systems: 

1 If you don't have a disk drive, go to step 4. 

2 Insert the disk marked DOS 3.3 System Master in the disk drive. 

3 Close the drive door. 

4 Turn on the computer and the monitor. 

5 If you don't have a disk drive, go to step 9. 

6 If you have an Apple II without the Autostart ROM, you will get the 
Monitor prompt ( * ). Type 6 followed by control-P (that is, hold down 
the control key while you hit the P key) and the return key. 

7 The light indicating that the disk drive's in use should come on and 
the drive will make some noise. Wait until it stops. 

8 If you have an Integer Basic prompt ( > ) on the screen, type FP fol- 
lowed by return. 

9 You should now see the Applesoft prompt ( ] ) on the screen followed 
by a flashing square. You are in Applesoft. 

This algorithm for getting into Applesoft will work on most versions 
of the Apple II. To keep it simple, some situations were not accounted 
for. (This is called a bug. You will get to know bugs intimately in the 
months to follow.) If you have an Apple He, make sure the key marked 
caps lock is in the down position. (Perhaps you'd want to put this into the 
"program" before line 1 .) If you have an older Integer Apple II without 
either a 16K RAM card or an Applesoft ROM card in slot 0, you can't 
use Applesoft Basic. If you have an Integer Apple with Applesoft on the 
ROM card, the procedure may be different; see the documentation that 
came with the ROM card. If you can't seem to get into Applesoft on 
your Apple, for whatever reason, consult your computer dealer. 

English as a Programming Language. This procedure is structured 
like an Applesoft program in order to demonstrate further how a com- 
puter program works. Look at the algorithm. Trace through it in your 
mind to determine what you would have to do if you had a different kind

Some Very Good 
Reasons to Buy 
an Echo Speech 
Synthesizer. 



We're confident we have the most intelHgible, 
versatile, and economical speech synthesizer 
on the market. Once you hear it, we're sure 
you'll be convinced too. All ECHOs are capable 
of speaking in four different voice modes 
which range from a robotic machine voice to 
natural female speech. (The fixed speech and 
custom modes are optional.) 

It's Easy To Use 

Unlike other speech systems, the ECHOs 
are very simple to use. It only takes a minute 
or two to get the ECHO talking. Any text 
which can be printed to the screen can be 
spoken. If you've written a BASIC program 
you can add speech with simple modifications. 

Software Compatibility 

Not only can you add speech to the programs 
you write yourself, over 25 top educational 
and adventure software manufacturers are 
currently designing programs to be compatible 
with the ECHO ][. Be watching for details. 




Value 

Each ECHO comes ready to use with a speaker 
and tutorial-style manual. The ECHO][, 
priced at $149.95, also comes with a variety 
of demonstration and utility programs . The new 
ECHO GP (General Purpose), priced at $199.95 
is a stand-alone unit with its own on-board 
microprocessor; it will interface with any 
computer through the serial port. All ECHOs 
have a two year warranty. 

Bells And Whisdes 

If you want bells, whistles, music and sound 
effects, plus state-of-the-art sprite graphics 
capabilities, the ECHO technology is available 
on Synetix Systems' new Supersprite Board. 

Check It Out 

Most Apple dealers have the ECHO][ available 
for demonstration as part of Street Electronics/ 
Orange Micro's unique Grappler+™, Buffer- 
board™, ECHO][™ Talking Demonstration.

of system. In some cases, some lines of the "program" will never be 
executed. 

Look at lines 1 through 3 of the original version. In the new version, 
lines 2 through 4 contain the same statements. Often when you are writ- 
ing an Applesoft program you will have to insert a line prior to one you 
have already typed, as we did with the new line 1 here. If the lines are 
numbered as we showed them, counting by ones, inserting a new line is a 
real pain. For that reason, it's a good idea to start with line 10 and incre- 
ment by tens: lines 10, 20, 30, and so on. That way, if you need to insert a 
new line between lines 20 and 30, all you'll have to do is call it line 25. 

Let's try some of these ideas out with some real commands. Get into 
Applesoft. When you see the ] and the flashing square, called a cursor, 
type: 

NEW 

The Soul of a New Command. Be sure it is all in capital letters. Even 
if you have an Apple He, Applesoft understands only those commands 
typed in upper case. When you have typed the word new, hit the return 
key. In Applesoft, hitting the return key tells the computer that you have 
finished typing a command. 

New is a verb in Applesoft. The new command tells the computer 
that any program in memory should be erased because the programmer 
wants to enter a new one. Depending on how you started up Applesoft, 
there probably was a program in memory. We don't want it there. 

You entered the new command without a line number. As such, it 
was not added to an existing program but executed as soon as you hit re- 
turn. This is called entering the command in the immediate mode, and 
new is most often used in this mode. If you had preceded the command 
with a line number, Applesoft would not have acted on it but would have 
inserted the line into whatever program was in memory at the time. This 
is almost never done with new because that would tell the computer to 
erase the program while it was running. Not good. 

You're now ready to do some simple programming. Type: 

10 PRINT "HELLO" 



Remember, whenever you type something, hitting return tells the 
computer to do something about it. There is now a program in memory, 
albeit a small one. To see it, type: 

LIST 

And there it is. Like the new command, list is most often used in im- 
mediate mode. It tells the computer to display the program in memory 
on the screen. 

You can probably guess what our program does. The print com- 
mand tells the computer to put something on the screen. Anything that 
follows print is printed on the screen, in one form or another. If what 
follows print is in quotes, it is printed as it appears in the program line. 
Something that is not in quotes will be interpreted in some way before 
being printed. 

The distinction is like the difference between saying to someone, 
"Tell me 'The sky is blue,' "and saying, "Tell me what day it is." In the 
first case, the likely response will be, "The sky is blue." In the second, 
however, the person may think about your request for a second and then 
say, "Tuesday." The request "Tell me" is the same both times, but the 
content of the rest of the sentence tells the listener whether you want a 
verbatim response or you are looking for information. So it is with the 
print command. 

Now you can run the program. This is done by typing: 

RUN 

Exciting, isn't it? Now try typing this: 

20 PRINT "I AM AN APPLE II" 

LIST 

RUN 

The first item you typed was a program line. The other two were im- 
mediate mode commands. When you finished typing the program line, 
Applesoft added it to the program. When you typed the first command, 
Applesoft listed what was now in the program: lines 10 and 20. When 
you typed the second command, the computer ran the program, print-

ing the messages. Let's try one more thing before we call it a month. 
Type: 

5 HOME 

Where do you thintc the line will go? List the program. Were you 
right? Whenever you enter a new line into an Applesoft program, Ap- 
plesoft puts it between the lines with the next higher and next lower line 
numbers. In this case, it put it at the beginning because there was no line 
with a line number lower than 5. If you use a line number that has al- 
ready been used, the old line will be erased when the new one is inserted. 
If you just want to erase a line without entering a new one, just type the 
line number and hit return. Now you know the basics of entering and 
editing an Applesoft program. 

Home Is Where the Cursor Is. Home is so simple a command that 
you can find out what it does for yourself. And don't look it up in a 
book: There'll be plenty of opportunity for that later. For now, experi- 
ment. Run the program. Add new lines. Nothing you can type will be 
able to damage the computer in any way, unless you type it really hard. It 
is sometimes possible to damage programs that are on the disk in the 
disk drive, so you might want to remove the disk if you plan to get more 
adventurous. The commands we've talked about this time are guaran- 
teed 100 percent harmless. 

Next month you'll get more stuff to play with. We've covered a lot of 
important conceptual ground that will help you understand things as we 
move along. As a review, you might want to look over the accompany- 
ing glossary, which lists the terms and commands covered this month. 

Try this little exercise. Write out an algorithm for some common task 
like setting the dinner table or sorting the mail for different members of 
the family. If you feel comfortable with the form, draw a flow chart of 
the task. If flow charts still look like Egyptian hieroglyphics to you, don't 
worry. We'll look more carefully at how to "think" a flow chart next 
month. 

Programming is more than just commands and syntax. If you learn 
the way of thinking — it's not hard, just different — learning to program 
becomes easy. 



GLOSSARY 

Algorithm: A systematic method for solving a specific problem. 

Command: A verb in the Applesoft language. 

Flow chart: A graphic outline of an algorithm or program that 
uses rectangular boxes to represent tasks, diamond-shaped 
boxes to represent decisions, and arrows to indicate flow of 
control. 

HOME: Command to clear the screen. Next character printed 
will be in the upper left corner. 

Immediate mode: The state of a command entered in Applesoft 
without a line number. Such a command is executed imme- 
diately rather than being inserted in an existing program. 

Line (program line): A statement or set of statements with a line 
number. 

Line number: A number that serves to identify a line of an 
Applesoft program by giving it a unique name and indicating 
its position relative to other lines. 

LIST: Command to show the program on-screen. Usually used in 
immediate mode. 

NEW: Command to erase the Applesoft program in memory. 
Usually used in the immediate mode. 

Parameter: The necessary and optional information that goes 
together with a command to make up a statement. Param- 
eters correspond loosely to parts of speech, such as direct and 
indirect objects, adverbs, and prepositional phrases in English. 

PRINT: Command to put information on-screen. Anything in 
quotes is printed verbatim. Data that is not in quotes is 
evaluated and its value printed. 

Statement: An Applesoft command combined with the required 
and optional parameters to tell Applesoft a specific thing to do. 

RUN: Command that executes the Applesoft program in 
memory. Usually immediate mode. 

Syntax: The rules governing the use of Applesoft commands.

MASTERMIND

liy Andrew Cliristie 



hat is the measure of a piece of educational software? 

It's whether it can teach the programmer who pro- 
grammed it what he programmed it to teach. 

Bruce Zweig downplays his educational career, but it 
has not been undistinguished. He spent his undergraduate 
days at MIT in the field of operational research — constructing mathematical models 
of business and social situations. After getting his d^ree, he spent a year as a substi- 
tute teacher in the Boston inner-city schools. After that, with the idea in mind that he 
wanted to work in education but with computers as well, he returned to his home 
town of Washington, D.C., intending possibly to work as a programmer for some 
governmental education agency. 

"There was at that time [the early seventies] a major move to improve the quality 
of education in socially disadvantaged or economically deprived areas," Zweig re- 
calls. Securing a position with a small consulting firm, he helped to program the model 
used by Congress to determine which schools had the greatest number of poor stu- 
dents and should get the most money. 

"Whoiever a new bill would come up relating to education. Congress would say, 
'Well, suppose we use this poverty cutoff and give $10 per kid to every school that has 
more than 20 percent disadvantaged kids. What'll happen if we approve this l^sla- 
tion?' " From 1975 to 1980, every proposed federal-aid-to-education bill would go

through Zweig's model. 

Not bad for a kid just out of college. And yet he continued to harbor 
a secret shame. 

"I couldn't type. I was a programmer; I had to type in my programs 
. . . but I had to look at the keys. I had never learned how not to." 

The obvious solution for a man who wanted to keep his educational 
and computer interests close together was to write a computer program 
that would teach him how to type. In those dark, pre-micro days, this 
was not a likely proposition. It would be a second or two before you 
found out how you did on a typing drill using a mainframe, and Zweig 
wanted instant feedback. 

Meanwhile, the entrepreneurial itch that would result in the found- 
ing of Lightning Software was beginning its nascent stirrings. Zwdg, like 
many others before and after him, was discovering that he wanted more 
creative freedom than one is generally allowed when programming for 
large companies. He left Washington in 1976, going to Stanford for his 
MBA, then signing up in the business school's Ph.D. program in 



marketing. 

Still, he yearned to type. And with the arrival on the scene of micro- 
computers — machines that knew you had pressed a key the moment you 
pressed it — his dream seemed closer to reality. He started sketching out 
his program. A friend bought an Apple, and he started spending a great 
deal of time at his friend's house. Then another friend. Trip Hawkins, a 
Stanford business school classmate and then director of marketing at 
Apple Computer, steered him into getting his own Apple. Then Zweig 
started putting some graphics into his basic typing tutorial, which now 
gauged how long it took him to type the keys and let him practice the 
ones he had trouble with. Just as he was thinking this might be a market- 
able idea, Mkn-osoft's Typi/^ Tutor hit the market WeU, that was that. 
He'd have to come up with a new approach. Something different. 

Getting up to Speed. At Stanford, he had occasion to hang out with 
Tom M alone, a psychology student who was then doing research for his 
book U^al Makes Things Fun To Learn?, a study of intrinsically moti- 
vating computer games. While hanging out with Malone, he also hung

WITH 
EVERYTHMG. 



Your best buy in modem history. The 
Networker™ a plug-in single-slot di- 
rect connect modem for your Apple II, 
II-I-, and He (or Franklin, Albert, or 
other Apple compatible computer). 
You are immediately linked to the 
vast network of computers — data 
bases like the Source® Compu- 
serve*' or Dow Jones'? friends, banks, 
businesses, and hundreds of local ' 'bulletin 
boards." For only $129. There's absolutely 
nothing else to buy. And it even comes with 
software. 

This is the modem that does it all, and does 
it for less. The Apple Communications Card is on 
board, so you won't need to buy one. That will 
save a bunch. It's 300 baud, the most commonly 
used type of modem. It comes complete with its 
own communications software on Apple compati- 
ble disk, giving you features no modem offers. 

Like "data capture" to lock the messages 
into your Apples' RAM, and then move the infor- 
mation onto a disk for easy reference and review. 
A terminal program that turns your computer into 
a communications command center, displaying 
on-screen "help" menus, continuous updates of 
memory usage, carrier presence, baud rate, 
communications status, all while taking in and 
displaying information from any computer. 

The Networker supports both originate and 
answer modes, so you can send and receive in- 
formation, in full or half duplex modes. And its 
all easily programmable right from the keyboard 
of your Apple computer. All you do is plug Net- 
worker into any slot (except 0) in your Apple 
computer. It'll even ask you what slot it's in. 
It's that easy to use. 




NETMASTER™ COMMUNICATIONS 
SOFTWARE 

For $179 we include the even more incredible 
Netmaster software for advanced users. Net- 
master is a "communications freeway" that 
lets you speed any Apple file to another Apple 
through noisy phone lines, without errors. Net- 
master even includes its own Disk Operating 
System to control the flow of information and 
leave you over 40K of "buffer" memory from 
your 64K RAM. And there's always help when 
you want it. On screen. Status indicators keep 
you fully updated. 

Netmaster will let you transfer games, 
computer graphics, programs, sales reports, 
documents, any DOS 3.3 file, all directly from 
disk to disk, all with computer (not telephone) 
accuracy. Netmaster is completely configurable 
to understand any computer, even mainframes. 
File size is unlimited. 

But Netmaster is not stuffy. It will talk to 
the other communications packages like Visi- 
term® or ASCII Express® Of course they don't 
support Netmaster's superb error checking, 
that guarantees you won't miss even a comma. 
It doesn't only talk to the Networker either. It 
will also talk to those more expensive modems 
from Hayes and Novation. 



And Netmaster is fast. It trans- 
fers information disk to disk three to 
five times faster than the others. Of 
course Netmaster is fully compatible 
with them. But if you want things to 
happen really fast, talk to another 
Netmaster. 
We sell Netmaster by itself for $79, 
and even if you have another modem for your 
Apple, Netmaster is an outstanding value. It will 
even support auto dial and auto answer. Net- 
master requires 48K of Apple memory, disk 
drive and DOS 3.3, and ZOOM'S Networker 
modem or another modem. It can also be used 
without a modem when two Apples are hard- 
wired together, using a 6850 or 6551 -based in- 
terface card. 

Networker, Netmaster, and Networker/ 
Netmaster combo are all produced in the USA 
by ZOOM Telephonies, producers of the popular 
DEMON DIALER. The Networker is FCC regis- 
tered, and all products come with a one-year 
warranty.

MasterType 1.0 was entirely ASCII, fired only one missile at a time, and didn't tell you your speed. Those were the days. 



out in the Stanford computer center. These two activities were to prove 
significant. 

"One day I was playing Robots on a DEC minicomputer, using a nu- 
meric keypad to move the robots around. I found that I was getting pret- 
ty adept with the keypad, and pretty soon I wasn't looking down to see 
where the numbers were. I figured, 'Hey, these robots could teach you 
how to type!' " 

And voila; MasterType. That's all there was to it. Practically. 

Just as Michelangelo created his statues by cutting away everything 
that didn't look like a statue, the basic design of the game just seemed to 
Zweig to be the way it should be designed. It has remained essentially un- 
changed. Four words appear in the four corners of the screen. When you 
select one word to type, each letter appears (or doesn't appear, in ad- 
vanced modes) in a box at center screen. As you type, missiles begin to 
converge on your center position from the four corners. One word suc- 
cessfully typed results in the destruction of that word's missile, and you 
immediately proceed to deal with the others in like manner, defending 
your position by typing as fast and accurately as possible. 

Back Straight; Fingers Arched; Feet on the Floor. . . . That was the 
basic conception. The first thing he decided to do was add learning rein- 
forcement. The best way, perhaps, was to give a reward, a congratula- 
tory message or words of encouragement, at the end of every correctly 
typed line. No, that would be too long to wait. Maybe at the end of ev- 
ery word . . . but when you're first learning, even that could mean long 
stretches of nothing. Then he thought of video games and how the sec- 
ond you zap the guy you get a colorful explosion and sound . . . and so it 
was decided that MasterType would have a beginner mode where at 
every single keystroke — kazoom, pow — you'd get reinforcement for 
doing it right. 

Zweig wrote the first version in Basic, using just characters for the 



graphics. It kept dropping keystrokes. He learned assembly language so 
he could get the keystroke response fast enough to keep up with the user. 
In September 1980 he made up his first ad and showed it to friends, ask- 
ing if they thought anybody would buy the thing. They said "maybe" 
and told him a lot of ads never get any results at all. He put the ad in a 
magazine in January 1981, selling through mail order only, and got 
about ten orders, enough to pay for the ad, all he had really been look- 
ing to do. 

March 1981 marked MasterType'^ public debut at the West Coast 
Computer Faire in San Francisco. That show and subsequent shows 
proved invaluable for field testing. When Zweig realized that everyone 
who came up to the booth was asking the same question, to which he 
was always giving the same answer — "Type the words in the corners be- 
fore the ships crash into you" — he put the answer in the program, mak- 
ing it one of the first things that come up on the screen, and there it re- 
mains to this day. 

There were other means of testing. He gave a copy to a friend, who 
gave it to his daughter. While he was over at their house for dinner some- 
time later, MasterType came up in conversation, though the daughter 
didn't make the connection between daddy's dinner guest and the au- 
thor of her computer game. 

"It stinks," she said cheerfully. "It's really ugly." 

"That," Zweig remembers, "is when I knew I had to do a hi-res 
version." 

Now Is the Time. Zweig was still a student at Stanford and still mak- 
ing updates for the Library of Congress to his mathematical model of 
disadvantaged schools. His studies were suffering. Publishers were con- 
tacting him. It was time to decide whether he wanted to be in software 
full-time or finish his Ph.D. He decided to start a company, and he knew 
he couldn't do so alone. 



"I had to write a full hi-res version of the program; that, plus distri- 
bution and advertising, was going to be a lot of work." At that time, Stu 
Berman, now with Broderbund, was trying to start his own company out 
of his living room. As Zweig was trying to start a company out of his liv- 
ing room, and Berman was spending a lot of time in Zweig's living room 
anyway (playing Space Invaders), they decided to join forces. They offi- 
cially formed Lightning Software in August 1981 . They worked until De- 
cember just to get the operation running, setting up production and dis- 
tribution. Zweig took each successive version of the new MasterType to 
George Johnson, product manager at Apple, who offered encourage- 
ment and criticism and suggested changes. 

"In those days you had to write all your utilities yourself," says 
Zweig. "I wrote a sound editor and all my own hi-res routines. I went to 
see Bill Budge, who was just starting his own company then. He said I 
needed to have preshifted bit maps. So I used preshifted bit maps. If I'd 
let someone else publish it, they probably would have given me all the 
utilities, but I was committed to starting my own company. That meant 
the programming was definitely more of a challenge." 

It was a challenge well met. The current product (officially, Master- 
Type 1 .7) is an intentionally nonpedagogical, self-paced, student-friendly 
program. "The main thing, I think," says its creator, "is that you get to 
choose which word you're going to type rather than having to go 
through a fixed rote order — though most people go clockwise anyway. 
You can use shields if it's too tough for you and just practice the words 
that are hard for you without having to start the whole sequence over." 

Every Good Boy Deserves Favor. Product testing has become more 
official lately with the addition to the staff of a testing consultant. Twenty 
copies of the program were donated to a Santa Barbara, California, 
school for a summer program for gifted minority children. Zweig appre- 
ciated the opportunity to get some idea of what constituted a reasonable 
rate of progress depending on age (all the students were sixth-graders), 
with an eye to including overall difficulty levels in later versions. He 



thinks testing will make future Lightning products more effective, al- 
though, to date, "nobody's ever complained. We've done minor touch- 
ups all along; people will write to us and say, 'Why don't you put this in?' 
and we will." 

Currently, Lightning Software is engaging in considerable market ex- 
pansion. Its single product is now on the Apple, Atari, IBM pc. Com- 
modore 64, and VIC- 20. Future products will use the tried and true Mas- 
terType format for teaching other subjects. ("This is a fun way to learn 
typing; using it to learn subjects that are actually interesting should be 
even more fun," Zweig predicts.) The company has long since moved 
from Zweig's living room. Its two-month-old Palo Alto headquarters 
houses shipping and receiving, a marketing division, and a staff of in- 
house programmers, as well as the company president and his five-dol- 
lar office chair, the first official business furniture he purchased when he 
started the company. 

Jump over the Lazy Dog. Having arrived at this point, the young 
president of the young company has come to ponder the issue that all 
those who have gone before him have had to face. "I wasn't sure I 
wanted to stop programming and start hiring authors, which seems to be 
the path you have to take when you start a software company," muses 
Zweig. "It was kind of depressing. But running a company is a full-time 
job and it takes all your concentration. I have a lot of ideas for programs 
and it bothers me that I haven't been able to execute any of them. It'll 
take me at least six months to do something new and different. Right 
now I have an idea for a program that would just be too hard to use and 
I'm trying to think of a way around that. 

"But mostly I work with the programmers on the conversions, or, if I 
want to put in some tricky little thing, I do it myself. I figure I've got a 
few good years of creativity left." 

All success has its price, but Bruce Zweig has definitely succeeded in 
what he set out to do. 

He doesn't have to look at the keys anymore.

CHECKBOOK FINANCIAL SYSTEM 

For Apple® II, II + , lie, III emulation, and Apple look-alikes 48K DOS 3.3 



526 SOLD 
ONLY 5 RETURNED! 

We were astounded! When we offered Money 
Street with a money back guarantee, we figured 
about 10% would be retumed. That's normal. 

But our retums run less than one percent! What's 
more, customers write enthusiastic letters daily 
about Money Street. For example: 

• Glen Rodkin, president of Oklahoma City Apple 
Users Group: "Tremendous! It's fast, reliable and 
covers all the contingencies a checkbook 
program should." 

• Chris Bayha, Portland, OFl: "I use it for my rental 
projjerties and for my business. It performs 
beautifully and is a great value." 

• Dan Thomas, Bgin, IL: "The program has proved 
the hype of the Money Street as really too 
modest. How many programs are there that you 
can't think of one thing you would do differ- 
ently?" 

One reason for this enthusiasm is that Money Street 
lets customers do their own books. Keeping records 
has always been a bother, and an expensive one, 
especially for small one-person business or the 
indeF)endent professional. But Money Street solves 
the problem. Here's what Weston Cotten of 
Highlands, Texas says: 

"I am an attomey with several business interests I 
run out of my office. I use nothing more complex 
than my checkbook to keep my financial records in 
shape for tax time. Your program has helped me to 
be a better record keeper and has allowed me to 
look forward to tax time with a better outlook." 

$99 For a checkbook program? Money 
Street isn't cheap, in fact it's one of the more costly 
checkbook programs. But with software, as with 
everything else, you get what you pay for: 

• Money Street is fast! Example: 9 seconds from 
boot to data entry. Example: 5 seconds from the 
main menu to any sub-section. Example: 18 
seconds start-up-to print time. 

• Money Street is easy to use! There are no 
complex set-ups; no monthly cut off. Gary 
Rominger of Sacramento, CA wrote: "Your 
claim of 30 minutes to learn rt is fully justified." 

• Money Street saves income taxes! It tracks 
deductions, credits, and income. Michael Salesin 
of West Bloomfield, Ml wrote: "When next 
year's tax season rolls around my accountant will 
send love and kisses." 

Saves money eight ways: 

1 . Rnds tax deductions and credits. 

2. Saves CPA write-up fees. 

3. Allows "before year-end" tax planning. 

4. Saves accounting time; provides input for 
journals, ledgers, and reports. The program also 
doubles as a mini-accounts receivable, inventory 
keeper, and job cost system. 

5. Saves interest expense by keeping exact 
balances. 

6. Saves NSF charges. 

7. Saves credit card interest charges. 

8. Changes your financial attitudes; puts you in 
control. 



Who can use it? Anyone using a checkbook: 
Lawyers, investors, doctors, general |3artners, 
professionals, small business, mini-corporations. It's 
ideal for people with multiple sources of income, 
trustee accounts, pension and profit sharing plans, 
and owners of real estate. 

Take farmers, for example: they can treat each crop 
or herd as a separate profit center. Stan Vasa of 
Lincoln, NE, says: "I use Money Street to keep my 
farm records and find the program to be excellent." 

Why not get the best? Sure, you can buy a 
cheap program just as you can buy a cheap clock. 
But is it really worth it? 

Many customers report that "home accounting" 
programs are difficult to learn, clumsy to use, and 
obsessed with budgeting; that only Money Street 
gives the speed, the ease of use, and the many 
reports needed. 

Bill Sampler, Fairfax Station, VA puts it this way: 
"One way I judge a program's worth is how easy it 
is to use after you have been away from it for a 
couple of weeks. Money Street is no problem, it 
runs like a fine jeweled watch." 

So, Money Street pleases customers just as a 
Porsche pleases drivers. Top quality costs more; 
that's a fact of life. But isn't quality always worth it? 

One of our customers. Buzz Buggerman of 
Oriando, FL said: "We use Money Street in our law 
office. We figure it's not the cost of the program 
that's important, but how much time it takes to set 
it up, learn it, and run it. Money Street's a breeze." 

How it works. On your computer screen, you 
create a facsimile of your checkbook. You see 17 
items per screen, and can scroll for more. As the 
computer balances your checking account, you give 
each check or deposit its own category code.

Mind Your 




BV PETER OLIVIER! 




Summer is rapidly fading away and the fall season is upon us. It's a 
time of changing weather, football games, reading, and new business 
opportunities. Perhaps it's also a time for thinking about your current 
computer system and applications and for considering new possibilities. 
Why not take a few minutes to consider the following questions; your re- 
sponses may help you decide what next steps are right for you. 

1. Have your needs outgrown your computer system? Could it be 
time to expand your system or to get an entirely new one? 

2. Are you using a lot of floppy disks for data storage? Does it take 
your system a long time to search through (or sort) your data? Might it 
be time to expand to a hard disk system? 

3. Have new versions of the programs you've been using been re- 
leased? Is it time to get the latest editions so you can take advantage of all 
those little extras that weren't included in the originals? 

4. Are there applications you haven't attempted yet? Is it time to 
purchase a project-scheduling program, a database management system, 
or a graphics package? 

If you find yourself nodding "yes" to some of these questions, it may 
be time for a change. Move carefully, though. Making a change to a new 
system or upgrading your present one is as serious a decision as it was to 
buy that first system. So do your homework. You may discover that the 
system you have can be expanded to accommodate all of your new 
requirements. Or you may find out that you'd be better off with an en- 
tirely new setup. 

The Business System — What Is It? Business users tend to fall into 
one of three categories. There are the experienced "computer people" 
who are comfortable around computers and actually write some of their 
own software, there are people who are less computer-literate from a 
technical standpoint who are nonetheless quite comfortable using canned 
software, and there are new system owners who are perhaps still getting 
their feet wet in the computer arena. There's probably a fourth category 
to consider, consisting of those who don't own or use a computer them- 
selves but who are around others who do. 

A variety of Apple computers out there could be called business sys- 
tems. In fact, most computer users would agree that the applications a 
computer system is used for dictate whether or not it is a business 
system. 

There's much to be said for a system that's been designed for a par- 
ticular market. A standalone word processing machine, such as a Dis- 
playWriter, a DECmate, or a Wangwriter, is a good deal easier to use 
than a microcomputer-based word processing system. In the same way, 
systems intended for the business environment include hard disks, inte- 
grated software, and design features that take advantage of the terminol- 
ogy and methods used in the day-to-day operations of the business. 

In most adequate business computer systems, you could expect to 
find the following hardware: 

1. A microcomputer with at least 48K of primary memory. (The 
minimum needed will soon be 64K.) 

2. A high-resolution color monitor capable of displaying eighty 
columns. 

3. A hard disk drive with at least five thousand megabytes of secon- 
dary storage. (This translates to about five thousand megabytes of addi- 
tional capacity — even this is not really enough.) The ability to back up to 
a removable cartridge is also necessary. 

4. A letter-quality printer with graphics capability (and probably a 



printer buffer so that the computer can be used for other tasks while 
printing is taking place). 

5. A keyboard that facilitates business applications — that is, one that 
has several programmable keys, a numeric keypad, word processing 
keys, upper- and lower-case capability, and so on. 

6. A modem to use in communicating with other computers. 

In a business computer system, you could also expect to find soft- 
ware designed to facilitate the backup of important files, a spreadsheet 
program, a database management package, a business graphics pack- 
age, a word processing package, and a telecommunications package. 
Depending on the specific situation, a business user might also need or 
wish to have a general ledger package, a "slide show" package for dis- 
playing graphics, the CP/M operating system to enhance software op- 
tions, or a statistical analysis package. 

Users who are taking advantage of a business computer system are 
likely to have an account with an information utility, such as the Source 
or CompuServe, subscriptions to various computer publications, and

Ihe reason you bought a 
computer 

in the firstidace. 



Too many 
scraps of paper. . . 

Too 
many 

files, too much in- 
formation to sift 
through: a night- 
mare of paperwork. 

So you took the first of two 
essential steps to pull in the 
reins of an out-of-control flow 
of information: you bought a 
computer. 

Now you're ready for the next 
step, The General Manager, the 
computerized filing system 
designed with you in mind. 

Gateway to the 
computer age. . . 

Most people don't hold 
degrees in computer program- 
ming or engineering. They have 
neither the time, money nor 
desire to return to a classroom 
just so their business or 
household can enter the com- 
puter age. 

If you're like most people, 
you want a system that's: 

- Easy to use. 

- Adaptable. 

- Valuable. 

- Powerful. 

You want The General Man- 
ager. 

Who can use it. . . 

You can! Whether you're a 
butcher, baker or candlestick 
maker. Doctor, lawyer or ac- 
countant. Merchant or 
housewife. Anyone who wants 
to organize their records can 
use The General Manager. 

Take a housewife, for exam- 
ple, and ail of the scraps of in- 
formation she handles: address 
book (names, addresses, phone 
numbers, Christmas cards, 
birthdays); recipes (ingredients, 
mixing and cooking instruc- 
tions, how many it feeds, where 
it came from); household 
budget (checking and savings 
accounts, food, taxes, 
household supplies); health 
records (hers, husband's, the 
children, the pets). 




The General Manager 



NOW fKPPl^ lie COAAPATIBLE 



She could use The General 
Manager. If you deal with the 
same or more paperwork, you 
need it, too. 

Its simple. . . 

By the time you've read two 
chapters of The General Man- 
ager's instruction manual, 
you'll have it up and running. 
That's how easy it is to learn. 

It's adaptable. . . 

Some personal recordkeep- 
ing systems require you to ad- 
just your thinking to fit the com- 
puter. 

Not The General Manager. It 
was built with the understand- 
ing that you know more about 
your recordkeeping needs than 
we do, and adapts to fit your 
needs. 

For example, here's a typical 
job application. 




If the small businessman is 
happy with the information re- 
quested and the way it's set up, 
he follows the step-by-step in- 



structions to make the com- 
puter screen look like the paper 
form, like this =

It's that simple. 

YOU, not some programmer, 
design all of your own forms on 
the computer screen with the 
information YOU need to effec- 
tively run your business or 
household. 

It's fast. . . 

Consider this: You need a list 
of everyone who's behind in 
their payments by more than 
three months, or who owes you 
more than $1 ,000. 

How long would it take a sec- 
retary to sift through the files, 
collate the information and then 
type it into a report? What are 
the chances of an error being 
made? What damage is done if 
an error is made? 

The General Manager sifts 
through its files at computer 



speed and can send the 
information directly to 
your computer screen or 
f printer - without error. 

It's a value . . . 

At $229.95, it's less expen- 
sive than other personal 
filing systems that make prom- 
ises they can't keep. 

Look at some of its features: 

- Uses 1 to 4 disk drives. 

- Includes utility programs that 
others charge hundreds extra 
for. 

- Upper and lower case lettering 
without additional, expensive 
hardware. 

- It prints out reports on paper 
the way you want them. 

- Available on a hard disk sys- 
tem for those with extensive 
memory needs. 

The reason you bought a com- 
puter in the first place. . . 

The General Manager brings 
your record-keeping system in- 
to the computer age - simply 
and cheaply. No personal filing 
system does more.

ness computer systems are implemented might differ considerably, but 
most of the applications probably fall into the listed categories. By the 
way, many B.U.G. members are interested in new software applications; 
perhaps some of you who are using software you particularly like will 
describe to the rest of us any business applications programs that you've 
found especially useful. 

It would also be interesting to hear from experienced B.U.G. s who 
plan to upgrade their systems. Finding out what "bells and whistles" 
some of you old-timers plan to add or have already added to your orig- 
inal systems will help new business users develop some perspective on the 
possibilities. So take a moment soon to jot down on a postcard or in a 
letter what you have now and what you plan to add. 

Microcomputers in the Office. Computers in the workplace are be- 
coming more and more common. In fact, the workplace is under attack 
by micros. 

The way it usually starts is that someone in a company has a micro- 
computer at home or has seen one demonstrated. The next thing that 
happens is that management somehow gets the idea that it would be 
worthwhile for key members of the staff to become more computer-liter- 
ate. This idea is often implemented by inviting someone to come into the 
workplace and describe the potential applications of microcomputers in 
the office. 

The application described most often is VisiCalc, and the typical 
training event is a one- or two-day seminar at which a dozen or so indi- 
viduals get hands-on experience with microcomputers and VisiCalc or 
some other spreadsheet program. Such sessions often go very well. Their 
success is dependent on two key ingredients: First, the instructor must be 
good — not merely knowledgeable about computers or about VisiCalc, 
but also very good at actually teaching others about how they work; and 
second, lab sessions must have plenty of helpers available to help first- 
time users over the stumbling blocks they often encounter. 

As mentioned, most such introductory instruction geared to busi- 
ness users involves spreadsheets. At present, there are far fewer oppor- 
tunities to learn about using database management systems, graphics, 
and word processing. For most managers, learning to use a spreadsheet 



program is not especially difficult. There are only a few do/.en spread- 
sheet commands and there is far less involved in learning to operate the 
computer. Where people begin to have difficulty is in the development of 
the spreadsheet model itself. Managers learning to u.se a database man- 
agement system often experience similar problems — learning the basics 
oi operating a database management system is not all that hard to do, but 
learning to use it and to think in terms of how the records and fields in a 
database should be designed is a more difficult proposition. 

What all this points to is the fact that there seem to be two types of 
applications-program users. When it comes to spreadsheet users, for 
example, there are those who will learn to build, use, and refine their own 
models and those who wouldn't build models but who could (and 
would) use models built by others. Thus, it would seem that an organi- 
zation that wishes to integrate the microcomputer into its facility would 
do well to do the following: 

1 . Provide managers with an overview of what the microcomputer 
can do (that is, of the major applications mentioned earlier). 

2. Identify those who would best be characterized as users and those 
who have or could acquire the skills that model-building requires. 

3. Provide model builders with two phases of instruction — the first 
should introduce all the aspects of the particular spreadsheet to be used, 
and the second should focus on the skills that the building of effective 
and correct spreadsheet models requires. 

4. Identify those areas and people in the organization that might 
benefit from using a spreadsheet model. Send in a knowledgeable, well- 
prepared instruction team to spend some time with the people you've 
identified and help them build a model for their use. In this way, areas 
within an organization that lack model-building skills can still benefit 
from this new tool. 

Many organizations are simply providing wholesale exposure of all 
their people to a hands-on spreadsheet seminar. It might really be better 
to take the time to identify what applications are likely to be designed us- 
ing a spreadsheet, where these applications will be located, who will be 
using them from day to day, and who might be able to design the models 
that drive the applications.

SEPTEMBER 1983* 



Ouch! Learning to use a computer can keep a person rather busy. 
Add in that magic word "statistics" and the prospect is enough to make 
a lot of folks shudder. After all, few of us had an easy time with statistics 
in school. 

Numbers are a major component of business decisions. Forecasts, 
budgets, and market shares are all based on numbers. And think for a 
moment how much we all depend on statistics. We're always asking 
questions like, "What percentage of the people who own Apples are over 
forty?" or "Can you show me a table that will display the educational 
level (high school, college, graduate school) achieved by all Apple own- 
ers, broken down according to the person's sex?" 

SoftCorp International's SpeedS TAT just may be your answer. Vol- 
ume 1 (the current program is the first package in a planned series) 
handles frequencies and crosstabs. 

Those of you who have some experience using statistical packages on 
a large mainframe computer are already familiar with frequency and 
crosstab options. The program is ^/'i'^'-like in its implementation of 
these features. There are, of course, limitations on the amount of data 
that may be analyzed, but SpeedSTAT performs many of the same 
analyses as SPSS. 

"Frequencies" is a procedure that produces frequency distributions. 
Suppose that you want to analyze the results of a questionnaire that was 
given to two hundred people and that one of the questions has four pos- 
sible answers numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. The frequencies program would 
print out the number of people who chose number 1, number 2, number 
3, and number 4. The answers given would tell how many people re- 
sponded a particular way and what percentage of the whole a particular 
group of respondents represents. In addition, the frequencies program 
can display a variety of statistical calculations, including mean, median, 
mode, minimum, maximum, range, skewness, kurtosis, sample standard 
deviation, sample variance, estimate of the population variance, stan- 
dard error, number of missing values, and number of valid cases. 

The crosstabs program produces tables, often called two-way tables, 
that show how one variable compares to another. In our example, we 
might want to know how many males and females responded to the 



question (how many males chose number 1, how many females chose 
number 1, and so on). The program would print out just such a table. 
The rows in our example table would list the sex of the respondents and 
the columns would list the numbers of the answers. Each cell of the table 
would contain a count of how many of the two hundred respondents met 
the specified criteria (for example, female and chose number 3). 

In addition, this program produces such statistics as the row, col- 
umn, and total percents for each category, chi-square, Cramer's V 
lambda, gamma, Kendall's tau C, Somer's D, contingency coefficient C, 
Spearman's rho, Pearson correlation, the number of missing values, 
and the number of valid cases. (By the way, you don't have to under- 
stand every one of the statistical measures in order to benefit from fre- 
quency distributions and crosstabs, so don't worry if, like most of us, you 
have no idea what a Somer's D might be. Certainly, one must be careful 
in making generalizations about data without a knowledge of the statis- 
tics. Many times the statistical measure tells the researcher that, al- 
though the data looks great, it occurred by chance and should not be re- 
lied upon.) 

Using SpeedSTA T requires a 48K Apple, two disk drives, a monitor 
or television set, and a supply of disks. A printer is not required but 
would certainly be useful in preserving hard copy of the reports. 

There are basically six parts to the package: data in, data out, edit, 
statistics, reports, and setup. 

Data in is used to get the data into the system. Data may be entered 
from the keyboard or from a data disk. This section is also used to iden- 
tify the design of the data. Essentially, a data set is made up of cases, such 
as a person's set of responses to a questionnaire. The cases are made up 
of variables, namely each question that a person was asked. The vari- 
ables have answers. These answers have labels (words that describe each 
answer) and values (the answers themselves). In addition, SpeedSTAT 
can access data stored in DIF files so that it is compatible with a variety 
of other products. 

Dala out is used to store the current data set on a data disk. Also, the 
entire data set must fit into main memory. This can be a limitation when 
it comes to some types of processing.

CjM^^ M^CjMJxJ CjM\ or small businesses operating out of the home. 



EZ-LEDGER uses the simplest form of bookkeeping possible. Single entry book- 
keeping requires only posting transactions either under INCOME or EXPENSE. 

EZ-LEDGER will keep track of expense items under any one of 99 user selected 
tax codes plus all year-to-date and monthly running totals for each of the 
selected items. Expense items may be entered under DEDUCTIBLE or NON- 
DEDUCTIBLE type codes. 

EZ-LEDGER is a strictly cash system, i.e. if you pay out monies (check, cash, 
credit cards etc.) then the transaction is posted under EXPENSE and if you 
receive monies then record them under INCOME. 

EZ-LEDGER will produce INVOICES with an automatically incremented Invoice 
number and then automatically post the data to an ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 
holding file or directly to INCOME and updates all totals. 

The accounts receivable and accounts payable files are "holding" files with their 
own running year to date totals. Transactions in these files may be automatically 
posted to INCOME or EXPENSE and all respective totals will be updated auto- 
matically. 

EZ-LEDGER will support 80 or 132 column printers and one or two disk drives. The 
printer is needed for producing invoices, but optional on all other reports. 




EZ-LEDGER requires 48K ram, APPLESOFT rom and DOS 3.3

Edit is one of the more powerful options available. It allows you to 
display any case, modify any case, add new cases, identify which cases 
should be included in a subsequent analysis, edit names given to vari- 
ables, enter or edit labels given to values, recede values (that is, to spec- 
ify code numbers to signify a particular range of values), and to search 
through the cases using a variety of search criteria. 

Statistics is used to select and execute a variety of statistical meas- 
ures. You can even do some sampling of the data before processing 
it fully. 

Report possibilities include a raw data report (all data is included), a 
raw data summary, frequency distributions of your choice with accom- 
panying statistics, and two frequency tables (crosstabs) with accompa- 
nying statistics. 

The setup section creates work disks and allows you to set the appro- 
priate printer parameters. 

One of the most impressive parts of this package is the documenta- 
tion. It is unusually readable, contains loads of actual screen illustra- 
tions, and is well organized. It covers using the computer, using a soft- 
ware package, and using statistics, so this is no small accomplishment. 
The manual was written by a user who wasn't a computer professional; 
perhaps that says it all. 

Since many people who are interested in statistics are accustomed to 
using large mainframe computers with very large main memories, how 
much data a program can process is a pertinent concern. The amount of 
data SpeedSTA T allows you to work with is a function of how many 
variables there are in each case. More specifically: 

Number of Cases 
Allowed

In Each Case

As you can see, the package can accommodate data sets of reasonablel 
size. It's important, of course, to have a good sense of your application 
before choosing a statistical analysis package. 

Statistical analysis can add a new dimension to your decision-mak- 
ing aids. If you are already a statistics user and you've been looking for a 
microcomputer-oriented package, this one should meet your needs. It 
will not teach you all about statistics; it does make it easier to work with 
them, however. You, as always, must do your homework ahead of time 
in order to determine what measures are important. SpeedSTAT pro- 
vides many capabilities that both the professional statistician and the 
novice will find useful. 

B.U.G. Advice. One of our Business User Group members wrote in 
to ask whether it would be okay to use both sides of a floppy disk. It 
seems she saw a device at a computer show that would cut a notch in the 
backside of a disk so it would no longer be write-protected, and she was 
hopeful that this procedure would double a disk's capacity. 

Before you decide to use both sides of a disk, consider these facts: 

1. When you use the opposite side of a disk, the disk itself rotates the 
opposite way. Since the purpose of the "dust jacket" is to wipe the disk 
surface, this opposite rotation may cause any collected particles to come 
loose and scratch the surface of the original side. 

2. Disk manufacturers test both sides of a disk for any defects. If a 
defect is found on one side, that side is often used as the underneath side 
when the disk is packaged and sold. 

3. Using both sides of a disk decreases the life of the disk. 

For these reasons, using both sides of a disk is certainly not recom-

The GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT is a new 
graphics system that combines five major 
graphics tools into one friendly, easy-to- 
learn HI-RES graphics package. All visuals 
produced are HI-RES pictures suitable for 
printing or turning into slides. 

1. The chart generator automatically 
creates colorful pie, bar, scatter, or line 
graphs from your tabular or Visicalc DIF 
files. Automatic labeling and direct loading 
from Visicalc help prevent errors and save 
time on multiple charts. Each graph may 
include up to 99 data points. 




You can even 
overlay multiple images. 

2. The lettering kit includes 20 character 
fonts.. .from Old English to Bold Modern, 
from headlines and shadow effects to tiny 
text. You may letter anywhere on a HI-RES 
picture with complete control over character 
size, color and direction. 

3. The graphics tools module lets you 
"cut and paste," overlay, merge, flip, shrink, 
invert, mask, change colors, or add patterns. 
You can use these graphic tools to edit and 
combine charts, or even to create pictures 
from scratch. 

4. The slide projector combines your 
graphics into a professional-looking 
presentation. You can move "slides" 
forward or backward with the game paddle 
or even automatically display them at preset 
intervals. It's a great way to beat "rush" 
presentation deadlines! 



5. Editors are available in both the 
charting kit and the slide projector to 
simplify your data entry. 

All these features are now combined into a 
single package for the first time. Now you 
can do your entire presentation with just 
one graphics program. All you need is the 
GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT program, an 




Apple computer (II, lie, or III), 48K, and 
Applesoft. 

GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT is available for 
only $124.95 at your local computer store. Or 
directly by mail (please add $1.25 for ship- 
ping). Visa, Mastercard, COD, and checks 
welcome. For more information or to order:

What sqjarates a successful business from a 
blockbuster? VisiCorp, nee Personal Software, 
presents an example of the latter. Its superstar 
product, VisiCalc, became such a hit that man- 
agement decided to change the name of the 
company to reflect the product's name. Was 
this success all due only to the merits of a soft- 
ware concept whose moment had come, or was 
the foresight and willingness of the manage- 
ment to take risks — from the word go — also a 
crucial ingredient? 

So/talk first introduced its readers to the 
VisiCorp people and their forward-thinking ap- 
proach back in October 1980. The company 
was still doing business as Personal Software 
then. Here was a firm whose growth became the 
archetype of the Silicon Valley success story. 

VisiCorp's Dan Fylstra and his wife op- 
erated a software mail order operation out of 
their apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
That was in 1978, and their product line con- 
tained many games one might consider collecti- 
ble today, some by nature of their obscurity, 
others by nature of the huge popularity they've 
enjoyed since they were originally released. 

One such collectible hit program was devel- 
oped by Canadian Peter Jennings, the cofound- 
er with Fylstra of Personal Software, toward the 
end of 1978. This popular chess program, Mi- 
crochess, along with the marketing savvy of Fyl- 
stra, made possible all that would follow for 
Personal. 



With the success of this program under their 
belts, Jennings and Fylstra were in a position to 




begin parlaying the company, which started 
with an initial investment of $500, into one 
whose worth is now appraised to run some- 
where in the area of $125 million. Armed with 
an understanding of the necessity to take risks, 
they felt compelled in late 1978 to embark on a 
course of action that could make or break the 
company. 

They decided to go for broke, funding MIT 
grads Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston with 
$100,000 worth of the profits from Microchess 
to develop what was envisioned to be a busi- 
ness forecasting tool or spreadsheet. The gam- 
ble paid off: VisiCalc became a long-running 
top seller, setting a standard that all competi- 
tors addressing the business software market 
would have to acknowledge. 

By 1980 Personal Software had received 
$500,000 in private placement ftmds from a ven- 
ture capital arm of the Rockefeller family, as 
well as all the management expertise that went 
along with the association. A few months be- 
fore the Exec feature Softalk presented on the 
company in the latter part of 1980, Terry Opn 
dendyk, formerly of Intel and, before that, of 
Hewlett-Packard, had been recruited to fill the 
position of president and chief operating of- 
ficer. Jennings had begun to concentrate his ef- 
forts in advanced research and development, 
and Fylstra, now chairman of the board, con- 
tinued to concentrate on what he then referred 
to as "doing an Apple." 

"We looked around the industry and liked 
what we saw at Apple, so we applied those ele- 
ments of success that were germane to our busi- 
ness and made them our own," says Fylstra. 
One of these elements was, by traditional stan- 
dards, the premature installation in executive 
positions of people that appeared to be over- 
qualified, thus allowing the company room to 
grow into the capabilities of its management. 

And grow the company did. With its change 
of name to VisiCorp and of residence to Silicon 
Valley, all the entertainment software that was 
part of its line early on was eschewed in favor of 
a complete line of business packages. Every one 
was called VisiSomething and was supported by 
a full-time staff of more than three hundred em- 
ployees. 

Left, chairman Dan Fylstra, and right, president 
Terry Opdendyk, VisiCorp's visionary helmsmen. 



In the spring of 198 1 , it became obvious that 
if hardware trends continued evolving as rapid- \\ 
ly as they were, certain things would be inevita- 
ble in the area of software marketing. Fylstra 
says, "One of our maxims is that user expecta- 1 
tions always rise to a point just beyond what i 
can currently be delivered." 

Plans wCTe laid to develop a series of inte- - 
grated multipurpose software packages that i 
would complement VisiCalc and take advan- I 
tage of the more powerful computer systems 
that consumers would be buying. 

Now, two years later, VisiCorp is about to 
unveil VisiOn. Though analogous in many ways 
to the approach taken by Apple with the Lisa, 
VisiOn is distinctively software-based, allowing 
it to run on various machines, above the level of 
the operating system. 

VisiOn and Lisa share a distinctive window i 
approach to interacting with various data struc- 
tures and a mouse that makes control keys and 
complex command codes a thing of the past. 
The VisiOn programs opt for a more verbal ap- 
proach to menu selection, instead of the graph- 
ic icons that Lisa provides to represent various 
tasks. 

VisiOn is scheduled to be in users' hands by 
October. The package will run on sixteen-bit 
machines (eight-bit machines not being power- 
fijl enough to accommodate it) and will use ex- 
panded monory and hard-disk-storage capa- 
bilities. The approach is modular Each appli- 
cation can be purchased separately. The initial 
release will offer three core programs, VisiOn

Calc, VisiOn Word, and VisiOn Graph, each in- 
tegrating substantial improvements over other 
similar applications already offered in Visi- 
Qjrp's product line. 

In such a period of rapid technological 
growth as the present, when the nature of the 
workplace is being redefined by burgeoning 
technology, the nature of the relationship be- 
tween labor and management must also be re- 
defined. The awareness of this essential connec- 
tion is reflected at VisiCorp in the share-the- 
wealth attitude toward employees that's con- 
cretely implemented in the company's profit- 
sharing and stock-option policies. The majority 
of VisiCorp stock is held by its employees in 
spite of successive rounds with outside venture 
capital investors — a little more than nine mil- 
lion dollars' worth — that the company has en- 
joyed to date. Management at VisiCorp stands 
committed to this approach that views worker 
participation as an essential ingredient for in- 
creased productivity and continued success. 

AnothCT solid commitment at VisiCorp, 
continued from the early days when Personal 
Software was just beginning in Boston, is the 
employ of the handicapped for product assem- 
bly. Last year VisiCorp was selected Handi- 
capped Employer of the Year for the San Fran- 
dsco Bay Area. The company currently em- 
ploys hundreds of handicapped people from 
various organizations, including a disabled vet- 
erans' group. 

Looking always toward the future, Opden- 
dyk sees the next frontier for VisiCorp to be in 
the area of communications and networking; he 
predicts a proliferation of local-area networks 
over the next few years. In consideration of this, 
all of the VisiOn line has the ability to com- 
municate with mainframes and other micros. 

The meteoric success of VisiOn, made pos- 
sible by the powerhouse team of Fylstra, Op- 
dendyk, and Jennings and backed by the sup- 
port of those in their employ, bears witness to 
the viability of risk-taking in the area of mar- 
keting as well as in the area of organizational 
structure and policy. Most companies that en- 
dure and become giants in their fields achieve 
success because the motivating people who 
make the decisions are risk-takers. 

But the nature of risks is that, sometimes, 
they don't pay off. 

Taking Chances. A man like Howard 
Hu^es predkated his life on taking risks, in 
business and pCTsonally. Plenty didn't pay off 
for him, but most of the crucial ones did. Be- 
sides that eccentric and monumental souvenir, 
the Spruce Goose (flown only once, and only 
for moments, with Hughes himself in the cock- 
pit), the giant and now diversified Hughes Air- 
craft Corporation remains a living monument 
to this innovator's risk-taking prowess. At the 
helm today is Dr. Allen E. Puckett, chairman of 
the board and chief executive officer. He bought 
himself an Apple in 1979 as a tool to help him 
understand better the implications of increased 
computing power on the flow of information at 
Hughes. Softalk told his story in September 
1981. 

At that time, Puckett had taught himself

their computer workstation at home. 



programming from the manual that came with 
his Apple and had devised some programs for 
his personal use to keep track of tax records and 
stock transactions. An enthusiastic yachtsman, 
Puckett wrote a program used in the Mazatlan 
Regatta to keep an up-to-the-minute account of 
each yacht in the race. The information that the 
program tracked, on each vessel's position and 
current standing, during the race kept the par- 
ticipants and the media who were covering the 
event well abreast of each yacht's progress. 

In his position at Hughes, Puckett was pre- 
occupied with a different kind of progress, that 
of adjusting company personnel to the elec- 
tronic revolution. The chief executive officer 
had come to understand the coming computer 
age as an electronic triangle: data processing, 
data storage, and communication. "Group all 
three and you have a totally new capability in 
excess of human capability," he said. 

Convinced at the time that computers 
would never replace the necessity of human in- 
teraction — such as the team effort he saw as 
fundamental at Hughes — Puckett believed that 
decCTitralizing the job site through the use of 
personal computers at home would probably 
not be conducive to his company's progress. 

But nowadays, things are changing. Based 
on his expoience of having the Apple at home, 
Puckett decided to risk an experiment. At the 
end of last year he picked the top fifty execu- 
tives at Hughes, most of whom had no com- 
puter experience whatsoever, and provided 
them with micros for their own use at home. 
Puckett hoped to enable those in management 
to gain a better understanding of, and commu- 
nicate more intelligently with, the computer 
professionals who are shaping the information 



revolution. 

The chairman now predicts that more and 
more home computers may become extended 
workstations, operating as terminals net- 
worked into company mainframes. At Hughes, 
this would be especially apt in the area of soft- 
ware design, which absorbs an increasing 
amount of development time on complex engi- 
neering projects, such as the engineering and de- 
sign of a satellite. 

On the home front, Puckett now has an 
IBM pc sitting adjacent to his tried-and-true 
Apple. And this new acquisition was good news 
to his fourteen-year-old son, Jimmy, who's been 
writing his own Basic programs for some 
time — having another computer around gives 
Jimmy more uninterrupted time on the Apple 
for programming and for playing Axis Assas- 
sin, his current favorite. The elder Puckett wor- 
ries about the preoccupation with game play- 
ing by Jimmy and his schoolmates, many of 
whom have Apples at home, too. Reassuringly, 
Jimmy praises WordStar for the ease with 
which he has applied it to school projects re- 
quiring word processing. 

Whether you're chairman of the board or 
merely a Hedgling hacker, the Apple you spend 
your time with can be an essential partner in 
your personal formula for success. It sure helps 
to have something you can rely on when ven- 
turing into uncharted territory — always a risky 
business. ~M 



One of the greatest thinkers of our time. R. Buckminster 
Fuller, passed away on July /, 1983. Softalk was priv- 
ileged to have visited with him for our January 1982 cov- 
er story. Fuller's enthusiasm for microcomputers will 
not be forgotten: the implementation of his World 
Game concept on an Apple continues at full pace. 




The ONLY BUFFER that let's your Apple & lie ' 

"PRINT PARALLEL! 
"PRINT SERIAL! 
*PROCESS/COMPUTE/ENTER DATA! 



No more waiting for your printer or other 
peripherals to finish with your Apple before 
you can use it again. Just plug the P/S 
Buffer Card into any slot and cable-connect 
to your parallel output card. After trans- 
fering your data to buffer (it takes only 
seconds), you'll be able to continue using 
your Apple in a normal fashion while print- 
ing parallel, or serial ... or both parallel and 
serial - all at the same time. 

In the dual printing mode, data to be 
printed parallel and serial are stored sepa- 
rately in the buffer memory. The memory is 
divided between them by intelligent firm- 
ware, proportional to the storage require- 
ments of each. The memory is expandable 
to 64K maximum in increments of 1 6K with 
plug-in RAM modules available from your 
dealer. 

P/S Buffer Card has both a parallel out- 
put port and an RS-232C standard serial 
output port. When you need to change from 
parallel to serial, serial to parallel, or out- 
put both simultaneously, you don't have to 
physically change cards. The intelligent 
firmware lets you do it by either software 
command or (optional) hardware switch. 



EXPANDABLE TO 64K 

P/S Buffer Card interfaces with most 
popular parallel printer cards including 
Apple,- Epson,-" Gr^appler,"' Graphitti,"^ 
PRT-1 and Tymac- If you don't already 
have a parallel card, order the P/S Buffer 
"Stand-Alone" Card. It includes a built-in 
parallel interface. An optional graphitti plug- 
in ROM allows you to dump the Apple hi-res 
graphic screens with a few simple i<eyboard 
commands.

This month we'll look at a few more new products for the Apple that 
should be of some interest. > 
Print Buffers. The Consohnk Corporation (formerly Compuhnk) 
offers two standalone print buffers. The first is SooperSpooler, a full-fea- 
tured, parallel/serial unit with up to 62K of memory. The Sooper- 
Spooler is completely self-contained, with its own power supply, cabi- 
net, and internal microprocessor. In addition to the power switch, the 
front panel sports a two-digit LED display, a reset button, and two sets 
of push button/LED indicators. The buttons control the space com- 
pression and pagination features of the SooperSpooler. The back of the 
unit provides input /output connectors, a "hard" reset button, and ac- 
cess to several DIP switches used to select the default configuration. 

The basic model of this print buffer includes 16K of RAM, a paral- 
lel input port, and a parallel output port. A memory expansion module is 
also available, as is a pair of serial ports. Besides functioning in its nor- 
mal fashion as an on-line buffer, the SooperSpooler can convert serial 
input to parallel output or vice versa. 

Connecting the SooperSpooler is as simple as removing the cable 
from your printer and plugging it into the spooler. Another cable con- 
nects the spooler to your printer. Several DIP switches for configuring 
the SooperSpooler to your system are accessible from the rear of the unit. 
Two of these set up the "line-feed-on-carriage-return" control param- 
eters for both the computer and the printer. Another switch controls the 
type of form feed used to advance the printer to the start of a new page. 

If the form-feed feature is enabled, the SooperSpooler automatically 
keeps track of the number of Unes printed on each page. When the form- 
feed command is encountered on the input stream from the computer (or 
generated internally by the SooperS pooler's pagination feature), the unit 
translates this command into the proper number of line-feed characters 
to bring the printer to the start of the next page. 

If the serial port option is installed, another bank of switches selects 
baud rates (both incoming and outgoing), character length, stop bits, 
and parity. Since the baud rates can be adjusted separately, input is nor- 
mally set to the highest rate common to the SooperSpooler and the com- 
puter. If the printer supports some form of handshaking, the output rate 
will usually be set to the highest rate available on the printer. If the 
printer does not support handshaking, the rate must be lowered until the 
printer operates reliably without dropping characters. SooperSpooler 
supports both XON/XOFF and ETX/ACK software handshaking, as 
well as the hardware RDY/BUSY control. 

The two-digit LED readout on the front panel continuously displays 
the amount of internal memory being used. Thus when a SooperSpooler 
with extra memory installed has become full, the readout displays the 
number 62. 

Pressing the space compression button toggles the space compres- 
sion mode on or off. The status of this mode is indicated by an LED 
above the push button. When this mode is active, the SooperSpooler at- 
tempts to conserve memory by compressing any number of consecutive 
spaces from 1 to 127 into one byte. This can make the buffer appear to be 
much larger, especially if the file contains large blocks of tabular data. To 
achieve this, the SooperSpooler examines each character that comes 
from the computer. If the character is not a space, it is placed into the 
input stream of the FIFO buffer. When the computer receives a space 
character, the spooler temporarily stops filling the buffer and begins 
counting characters. If the next character coming in is another space, the 
counter is incremented by one. Each consecutive space character re- 



ceived is counted until a nonspace character is received. At that point, the 
Spooler puts a special character into the buffer, followed, of course, by 
the current nonspace character that just came in. This special character 
consists of the number of spaces that were counted with the high-order 
bit set. Normal characters do not have the high-order bit set. 

When data is being read out for transmission to the printer, the pro- 
cedure is reversed. All characters emerging from the buffer with their 
high bits not set are sent to the printer as expected. But whenever a char- 
acter comes out with its high bit set, the Spooler automatically converts it 
into the number of space characters indicated by the lower seven bits of 
the code. Since this scheme for space compression uses the high-order bit 
as a flag, it cannot compress data that uses codes above 127; this means 
that this mode cannot be used when graphics, an alternate character set, 
or other eight-bit data are being printed. 

The page button toggles the SoopeiSpooler's automatic pagination 
mode. An LED above the switch confirms the present status of this fea- 
ture. When activated, the Spooler prints a predetermined number of lines 
on each page and then advances to the start of the next page. Most often, 
this feature is used to prevent printing on or near the perforations be- 
tween sheets of fan-fold paper. For this reason, this function is also re- 
ferred to as "skip-over-perf" 

The page button also performs a second function. If it is pushed while 
the Spooler is still outputting to the printer, printing halts temporarily at 
the end of the current line unless the printer has its own internal buffer. 
When the page button is reactivated, printing resumes. 

The soft reset button on the front panel affects only the buffer condi- 
tion of the SooperSpooler. A brief press of this button causes the buffer 
to clear and the status display to return to 00. The soft reset button is 
useful when you want to terminate a printout. It does not affect any of 
the other software or hardware parameters that have been set up. 

Several other features of the SooperSpooler are controlled by press- 
ing combinations of the above buttons. For example, pressing the soft 
reset and page buttons simultaneously turns on the single-sheet mode. 
This function makes the SooperSpooler easier to use with single-sheet, 
friction-feed printers. 

In some cases, the intelligent features of the SooperSpooler may need 
to be disabled so the unit can be used simply as a straight-through print 
buffer. This is easily done by pressing the soft reset and spac?-compres- 
sion buttons on the front panel. In this mode, incoming data is simply 
stored in memory and passed along to the printer; software commands 
are not checked for. 

Pressing the space compression and page buttons together initiates a 
self-test mode. In this mode, a software check of both ROM and RAM is 
performed and the results are displayed on the printer. 

The hard reset button on the rear of the unit performs a complete 
cold start (similar to turning the SooperSpooler off and then on again). 
This clears the buffer and returns all software-controlled features to their 
default values. 

Besides buffering data to the printer, the SooperSpooler offers a 
wealth of intelligent capabilities to enhance your hard copy, most of 
which can be accessed by means of software commands to the Sooper- 
Spooler. Each command is simply a string of characters, starting with a 
special "lead-in" character that is sent out by the computer. When the 
Spooler sees this special character, it stops filling the buffer and instead 
interprets the next character or characters as a control sequence. The de- 
fault lead-in character used by the SooperSpooler is the ASCII code 28,

but it can be changed to any control character. 

A number of useful commands can be sent to the SooperS pooler. 
Through them, you can accomplish pagination, line formatting, re- 
definition of the form-feed character, and redefinition of the lead-in char- 
acter. You can also disable the SooperSpooier's intelligent features so 
that all data is passed directly to the printer, embed a command to stop 
printer output, and turn space compression on or off. Each of the com- 
mands can be initiated directly from the keyboard (immediate mode) or 
from within a program (deferred mode). 

MicroSpooler. The MicroSpooler is SooperSpooier's little brother. 
For starters, the basic unit is about one-third the size of its full-featured 
sibling and contains only one input and one output port. Several models 
of the MicroSpooler are available, covering all the possible combi- 
nations of parallel/serial input/output. Like SooperSpooler, Micro- 
Spooler displays memory status by means of a digital readout. 

MicroSpooler has two push buttons, copy/pause and reset. De- 
pending on when it is pressed, pushing the first button activates one of 
several functions. If the Spooler is currently outputting data to the 
printer, then pressing this button halts, or pauses, printing. This button 
can also be used in creating multiple copies of the data sent by the com- 
puter. You can do this as an afterthought ("one more copy") or by pre- 
programming the unit to produce from one to ninety-nine copies. The 
former function is activated by pressing the copy button anytime after a 
printout has been passed through the MicroSpooler. 

After the complete document has been transmitted to the Micro- 
Spooler (note, of course, that the entire document must fit within the 
buffer), the Spooler automatically takes care of producing the exact 
number of copies requested. A pause between copies to allow for insert- 
ing new paper for each copy can also be activated. When multiple copies 
are being produced, the digital readout changes to display the number of 
copies remaining. Pressing both buttons together causes the Micro- 
Spooler to perform a self-test. 

Bufferboard. Provided that you still have an empty slot in your com- 



puter, you might find the Bufferboard from Orange Micro a useful addi- 
tion. This device, which connects to most printer interface cards via a 
short "docking cable," provides up to 64K of buffered printing. Its con- 
necting cable plugs onto the double-row header pins used by most 
printer cards, and the printer cable can then be attached to the 
Bufferboard. 

The standard Bufferboard comes with 16K of RAM using the popu- 
lar 64K (bit) dynamic RAM ICs. These chips are usually organized as 
64K by 1 bit and require a minimum of eight chips to store "bytes" of 
data. By contrast, the microprocessor on the Bufferboard is pro- 
grammed to operate with as few as two RAM ICs — making the 64K-by- 
2 memory array appear like I6K by 8. Simply adding the extra memory 
chips will increase the buffer size to 32 K or 64K. 

The Bufferboard uses the Apple's reset key to perform two func- 
tions. If the reset key is held down while the computer is turned on, the 
Bufferboard will perform a self-test of its RAM memory. After less than a 
minute, the results of the test will be displayed on the printer, and each of the 
eight possible RAM ICs will be identified as being good, bad, or missing. 

The reset key can also be used to clear the buffer; however, this func- 
tion will be performed only if the reset key is held down for more than 
two seconds. Briefly pressing this key resets the computer but does not 
disturb the Bufferboard's operation. 

If you already have an interface board you're satisfied with, the 
Bufferboard is an economical way to obtain printer buffering. Its major 
disadvantage is that it takes up another peripheral slot, something you 
may be running short of If you've just bought a printer and are looking 
for an interface board, Orange Micro's Buffered Grappler is a better 
choice. This board combines the Grappler interface and Bufferboard 
functions onto one board.

Printer), and Okidata. This year, we've seen ail three of these companies 
bring out their next generation of printers. The good news about these 
printers is that they offer faster speed, muitimode operation, and addi- 
tional features. For Okidata, this trend is represented by the Micro- 
line 92. 

The Microiine 92 has two basic modes of operation: the data process- 
ing mode and the correspondence-quality mode. In data processing 
mode, the printer works like any other dot-matrix printer. Using bidi- 
rectional printing with short-line logic-seeking, the printer attains speeds 
up to 160 cps (characters per second). In this mode, it uses a nine-by-nine 
character matrix to obtain draft-quality characters with descenders. In 
the correspondence, or near-letter-quality (NLQ), mode, the printer uses 
a nine-by-seventeen matrix and prints at 40 cps. The drastic cut in speed 
results from the fact that the printhead must make two passes on each 
line, both in the same direction. That is, the printhead prints a complete 
line, backs up, and then prints the entire line again. On the second pass, 
the paper advances slightly so that the printhead places dots in between 
the existing dots from the first pass. Note, however, that the dots printed 
on the second pass are not necessarily the same as those printed the first 
time — each character truly has a nine-by-seventeen dot pattern. The 
NLQ mode still uses logic-seeking to determine the best direction for 
printing each line, however. 

The Microiine 92 has three major font sizes: 10 cpi, 12 cpi, and 17 cpi 
(characters per inch). These correspond to pica, elite, and compressed 
character pitches. All of these fonts can be printed in double width, giv- 
ing three more sizes of 5, 6, and 8.5 cpi. Two forms of special printing are 
also supported. Emphasized printing causes each dot to be printed twice, 
one right next to the other. This gives the print a darker appearance and 
makes horizontal lines more continuous. Enhanced printing, whereby 
the paper is advanced by a one-half-dot width in between the two passes, 
is also available. This gives the print an even darker and thicker look, at 
the expense of a little clarity. There's a difference between enhanced 
mode and the NLQ mode. In enhanced mode, the very same dots are 
printed during both passes. The NLQ mode also allows proportional

spacing between characters. Proportional spacing must be done through 
software, however, by constantly supplying a new "space between char- 
acters" value. This is different from the NEC, C. Itoh, and Apple print- 
ers, all of which can proportionally space automatically. 

The Microiine 92 is also capable of printing slightly above or below 
the normal printing line. This makes it possible to print superscripts or 
subscripts for such things as chemical formulas or mathematical nota- 
tions. A continuous underlining feature allows the printing and under- 
lining of text in one pass. 

Line spacing can also be set to either six or eight lines per inch. 
Actually, any line height between 1/144-inch and 127/144-inch can be 
specified from software. Also selectable from software are page length, 
top of form, and right and left margins. Horizontal tabs and a vertical 
format unit complete the repertoire of the Microiine 92's page format- 
ting. Two other features of this printer are worth mentioning: down- 
loadable characters and graphics printing. 

Each ASCII character has three dot patterns stored in the Microiine 
92: one for the draft-quality mode (nine by nine), another for the NLQ 
mode (nine by seventeen), and the third for patterns the user defines. 
Characters are defined within a seven-by-eleven-dot field, and pat- 
tern information is sent to the printer using a special sequence of charac- 
ters. Once the "start loading" command has been sent, the code for the 
character being defined is sent, followed by the bit map for the char- 
acter. It takes eleven more bytes to specify this map — each byte repre- 
sents the dots to be printed in one vertical column of the character. 
Within each byte, a one signifies printing of a dot in the corresponding 
row, while a zero means no dot. Of course, when the printer is turned off, 
any downloaded character definitions are lost. 

For dumping pictures of the Apple's hi-res screens, the Microiine 92 
supports Okigraph dot-addressable graphics. This means that with the 
appropriate software, hi-res dumps can be accomplished with ease. Up 
to seventy-two dots per inch can be printed either vertically or horizon- 
tally. For the ultimate convenience, a printer interface card with on- 
board graphics dump routines should be used; just make sure your card 
has the appropriate firmware to work with the Microiine 92. 

The Microiine 92 appears to be sturdy and well built. It weighs 
almost twenty pounds. Most similar printers are lighter (an Epson MX- 
80, for example, weighs about twelve pounds). i 

A small lever on the right side of the unit is used to select either fric-m 
tion feed or pin/tractor feed. The standard printer is equipped with pin 
feed rollers for nine-inch paper. A tractor assembly, available separately, 
can be attached on top of the printer for full four-point tractor feed. This 
unit is adjustable on both sides down to a minimum spacing of three 
inches. A roll-paper holder is also available. 

Paper is usually fed into this printer from the top or back. When the 
tractors are used, however, paper can also be fed in through a slot in the 
bottom of the printer. This is a feature usually found only on higher- 
priced machines; of course, it requires that the printer be placed on a 
special printer stand that has a similar slot for bottom feed. 

On the front of the printer is a small control panel with five switches 
and three indicator LEDs. The switches perform line feeds and form 
feeds, select/deselect the printer, and set top-of-form. The last switch 
works in conjunction with a ten-position rotary switch that selects the 
form length. These controls make it easy to set up for the printing of con- 
tinuous-feed invoices, checks, or envelopes. The three LEDs indicate 
when the power is on, when the printer is selected (enabled), and when 
the printer has run out of paper. Also on this panel (behind the front cov- 
er) is a row of DIP switches that select various default parameters such as 
line feed on carriage return and foreign language character sets.

THE BASIC 




By Wm. Y R. Smith 



This month's Basic Solution presents a very 
fast circle-drawing subroutine. The subroutine 
requires that the hi-res screen be turned on and 
a color be set for line drawing. 

This subroutine was written and developed 
by Bill Depew. The logic of the circle algorithm 
requires a knowledge of advanced calculus and 
will not be discussed in this article. 

A circle is defined by the location of its cen- 
ter and the size of its radius. The subroutine 
requires you to specify the radius of the circle in 
the variable R and the screen coordinates of the 
center of the circle in X and Y. 

Another subroutine checks the radius and 
coordinates to make sure that the entire circle 
can be drawn on the screen. In the event the cir- 
cle cannot be drawn, the variable ER is set to 
one, indicating an error. This means that the 
circle goes off the screen and you should not at- 
tempt to draw the circle with the current 
parameters. 

A sample program is provided that draws 
various-size circles randomly on the screen to 
show how the routines are used in a program. 
Looking over the sample control program 
should give you an understanding of how to use 
the circle-drawing subroutio©- and the param- 
eter testing routine. 

After you have entered the subroutines and 
the control program and are satisfied that it 
runs correctly, you can edit the circle subrou- 
tine. You can change the way the circle is drawn 
in line 320. The current line 320 will draw a 
filled-in circle. Enter the following line 320 to 
draw a circle outline. 

320 HPLOT CX+X,CY+Y 

Here is an example of a different way to fill 
in a circle. 

320 HPLOT CX,CY + Y TO CX + X,GY+Y 



By changing this line you can even create 
cones. 

We will be using this subroutine in future 
Basic Solution articles so save it on disk for later 
use. Good luck with your programming.

space by the Mass-Driver. 



Civilization on Earth has been allowed to develop. Therefore, we can be 
quite sure that no civilization hostile to other life is in command of the 
galaxy- Either there has never been such a killer life form, or any that de- 
veloped were contained by earlier civilizations with peaceful intentions, or 
we are, in fact, alone in the galaxy. All three alternatives lead to a single, 
profound, and positive conclusion. 

Our galaxy is friendly, and it is waiting for us. 

— from 2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future 

Dr. Gerard K. O'Neill is optimistic about the future of the human 
race. Author, professor of physics, researcher, Apple owner, program- 
mer, president of both a high-tech startup company and a nonprofit 
foundation, pilot, and father, O'Neill is a man with a message: space. 

In his two-year-old treatise on the future, 2081 (Simon and Schus- 
ter), O'Neill proposes that when a civilization reaches the level of tech- 
nology we have today, there are only three paths its future history may 
take: self-destruction, stagnation, and the colonization of space. 

Making a Path under Surges That Threaten To Engulf Us. It's no 
secret that there are enough nuclear warheads in the arsenals of the world 
to bomb the human race back to the Stone Age, if not right out of exis- 
tence. And by stagnation, O'Neill means that the civilization might never 
grow beyond its own solar system. "A civilization could freeze its techni- 
cal progress at a modest level and could devote the rest of time to the 
arts, to philosophy, or to contemplation." 

O'Neill refers to the first two paths as "dead ends," though he does 
acknowledge that stagnation "could be perfectly satisfactory. After all, 
the oyster fills its ecological niche so well that it hasn't changed for a mil- 
lion years." But it's the third path, colonizing space, that he feels is the 
best one for our civilization. 

The idea of building human colonies in space is an old one. As far 
back as the writings of Cicero and Lucian it's possible to find fanciful 
speculations about space. The acknowledged modern-day father of space 
colonies is Konstantin Tsiolkowski, a Russian schoolteacher who pro- 
posed that a space colony requires only an air-enclosing shell and could 
make use of solar power and raw materials found in space. Tsiolkowski 
first developed his ideas in the early years of this century; he was way 
ahead of his fime. 

Several decades later the idea of colonies in space — as opposed to 
colonies on the moon and planets, which have always been popular no- 
tions — was revived by individuals like Robert Goddard, John Stroud, 
J.D. Bernal, and Dandridge Cole. O'Neill is the latest champion of the 



232 




cause of breaking through what he calls our "myopia, our inborn auto- 
matic assumption that all human beings, even centuries from now, will 
be born and live out their lives on planets, even if they venture briefly 
into space to travel from one planet to another." 

In 2081 , Gerard K. O'Neill takes us on a whirlwind journey through a 
world of ideas, a future that some of us may be around to see. Right 
now, he's heavily involved with the down-to-earth process of developing 
some of these technologies, including a curious piece of hardware called 
a "Mass-Driver." One of his hardworking colleagues, helping with the 
research and design of the Mass-Driver and numerous other tasks, is an 
Apple II Plus. 

New Jersey, the Final Frontier. O'Neill is currently a professor of 
physics at Princeton University and president of the Space Studies Insti- 
tute and Geostar Corporation. A native of New York state, raised in 
Connecticut and upstate New York, O'Neill received a B.A. from 
Swarthmore College in 1950 and a Ph.D. in physics from Cornell Uni- 
versity in 1954. Since 1954 he has been a faculty member at Princeton, 
teaching both graduate and undergraduate courses. 

O'Neill has conducted numerous research projects, especially in ele- 
mentary particle physics. In 1979, he published a graduate textbook on 
that subject with one of his graduate students. O'Neill is perhaps best 
known in particle physics circles for the concept of colliding-beam stor- 
age rings and for implementing this concept in the first high-energy col- 
liding-beam experiment. 

In 1969, O'Neill took an idea that had been around in various forms 
for decades — colonies in space — and promoted it as a realistic plan 
within the limits of existing technology. The early seventies were a frus- 
trating but exciting time, says O'Neill. It was difficult to gain support in 
the scientific community for his ideas, because they were so "threatening 
to 'establishment' thinking." He had to resist the temptation to give up 
and turn his work into science fiction. 

By the mid-seventies, O'Neill had stirred up more than passing inter- 
est among the scientific community and the aerospace industry with his 
conclusions "that we could build space colonies relatively soon, within 




Dr. Gerard K. O'Neill, president of tine Space Studies Institute and Geostar, 



the limits of known engineering pracfice, out of ordinary materials; that 
the colonies could be large, as much as a hundred square miles in land 
area; and that they could be, if we so desired, very 'Earthlike.' " 

In 1977, O'Neill wrote The High Frontier in which he worked out his 
version of a consistent, practical plan for building space colonies. He at- 
tempted to do what must be done with any new technical construct, forg- 
ing a chain of many links so that every link is correctly identified and 
proven feasible. One possible space colony design O'Neill wrote about in 
The High Frontier is what he calls a "Bernal Sphere" — named after 
J.D. Bernal, who wrote about the human habitation of space more than fifty 
year^ ago. 

The Bernal Sphere actually contains two spheres, one inside the 
other. The outermost sphere is stationary and made of lunar soil to shield 
the interior sphere from cosmic rays. The inner sphere has an 
atmosphere and slowly rotates, simulating the Earth's gravity near its 
equator. Solar energy provides power and light, with greenhouses pro- 
viding food. The interior could be lush with vegetation, while the area 
near the "Earth-normal" equator would be a good place to enjoy such 
sports as swimming and tennis. More esoteric athletic activities, such as 
zero-gravity soccer and human-powered flight, would be possible near 
the sphere's axis of rotation. 

In 1977, O'Neill directed a second study (the first was in 1976) on 
space manufacturing at NASA's Ames Research Center. That study re-

rial has escaped from the moon's gravitational well and is picked up by a 
"catcher" in high orbit. 

The rationale behind a device like the Mass-Driver is didated by eco- 
nomics. In order to build structures in space, material is needed. The 
power — and its cost — required to lift materials from the earth to high 
orbit (outside the earth's gravitational well) is enormous. 

Launching materials into high orbit from the earth requires about 
eighty tons of fuel to transport one ton of payload. O'Neill claims that 
for each ton of the weight of a Mass-Driver you'll get eighty tons of lunar 
material a year, 

O'Neill and others have argued convincingly that large- or small-scale 
colonizing of space could be accomplished faster and cheaper with space 
materials. The solar system is well-stocked with raw materials — chiefly 
asteroids and the moon, in our general vicinity. Devices like the Mass- 
Driver would provide an efficient way to transport these materials to an 
orbiting manufacturing site. As such, the Mass-Driver agrees with 
another underlying concept in an economical approach to space 
colonization — automation. 

It was much cheaper and safer to send an automated craft to Mars 
than it was to send a manned exploratory flight. The same kind of think- 
ing, according to O'Neill and his colleagues, will govern our future ef- 
forts in space. There will be many situations in which having automated 
devices like the Mass-Driver will be cheaper and more efficient than hav- 
ing human beings doing the work. 

O'Neill was the first to write about the concept of Mass-Drivers in a 
technical article — "The Colonization of Space" — published in Physics 
Today (September 1974). For the NASA study — Space Resources and 
Space Settlements — O'Neill worked with nine other researchers on three 
papers covering the electrical design, structural dynamics, and engineer- 
ing of Mass-Drivers. 

Primitive Drivers. Through the late seventies, O'Neill and his col- 
leagues at Princeton developed a working model of a Mass-Driver. The 
research, which was made possible through NASA funding, resulted in 
two scaled-down prototypes, MDI and MDII.

suited in a collection of technical papers dubbed Space Resources and 
Space Settlements (NASA SP-428), and it narrows down the problems of 
space manufacturing and building self-contained space colonies to five 
main areas: research needs for regenerative life-support systems, habitat 
design, dynamics and design of electromagnetic Mass-Drivers, asteroids 
as resources for space manufacturing, and processing of n on terrestrial 
materials. 

After completing the NASA study, O'Neill founded the Space Studies 
Institute (SSI), a nonprofit organization dedicated to funding research 
through popular subscription. He also got funding from NASA to begin 
work on a prototype Mass-Driver. 

What's a Mass-Driver? 

A Mass-Driver is an electrical device used to accelerate payloads of 
any material to a high velocity. This is accomplished by accelerating a 
small receptacle, known as a "bucket," containing superconducting coils 
through pulsed magnetic fields. The bucket is guided by induced mag- 
netic fields set up in a surrounding guideway. 

Lunar Rocks on the Rise. Imagine a one-hundred-sixty-meter-long 
tubular machine on the surface of the moon. Mined materials are put in 
an open-ended container at one end of the machine. A fraction of a sec- 
ond later the container races to the other side of the tubular machine and 
ejects the material into the thin atmosphere of the moon at a greater 
speed than the moon's escape velocity. Sixty or so hours later, the mate-

The basic driver design of a tunnel of electromagnetic coils, fired in 
sequence to accelerate a bucket likewise equipped with magnetic coils, 
has not changed from MDI and MDII to the most current Mass-Driver 
prototype, MDI II. 

What has changed is the speed to which the bucket can be accel- 
erated. MDI achieved a speed of 35 gravities and MDII reached a speed 
of 500 gravities. The hoped-for speed of 1,800 gravities (around two hun- 
dred fifty miles an hour) is possible with the MDIII. 

After the MDII project was completed, O'Neill realized that one 
minor change in the design of the Mass-Driver would significantly sim- 
plify the device and at the same time provide improved performance. 
This involved the change from a "push-pull" operation to a "pull-only" 
design. 

MDI and MDII, with their push-pull design, employed magnetic 
strips for dynamic guidance of the bucket through the driver coils. Those 




strips reduced the amount of the space available for the bucket. Using 
the pull-only design makes the driver self-guiding, or self-centering. Also, 
by increasing the diameter of the drive coils, the ratio of bucket coil diam- 
eter to drive coil diameter could be made quite large. It's that ratio that 
mostly determines the strength of the electromagnetic interaction be- 
tween the coils and the magnitude of acceleration the Mass-Driver can 
achieve. 

While O'Neill worked on the design, his colleague. Dr. Les Snively, 
received a postdoctoral appointment in Princeton's Physics Depart- 
ment to work on the construction of MDIII under a grant from SSI. Be- 
fore coming to Princeton, Snively did research at Montana State Uni- 
versity on low-dimensional magnetic interactions. MDIII was unveiled 
this spring and has gone through numerous test-firings, with full power 
tests planned for this fall. 

MDIII is a test section — the first twenty coils of a full-scale lunar

Mass-Driver. The diameter of the drive coils is forty centimeters and 
the diameter of the bucicet coil is thirty-eight centimeters — the nominal 
diameters of the proposed lunar model. The only part of the prototype 
that is not to lunar scale is the mass of the bucket. Due to a limited 
amount of energy-storage capability, MDIH's bucket mass is only one- 
tenth (40 grams) that of a lunar bucket-payload mass. 

Apple Driver. Over the course of a year, O'Neill wrote a program in 
Applesoft to calculate the whole operation of MDIII — all twenty drive 
coils and their interactions with the bucket coil. O'Neill has worked with 
all sizes and varieties of computers since the fifties and has found the 
Apple very useful in his research. 

Simulating the interactions between the changing currents and fields 
of the bucket coil with the other coils required twenty-one simulated dif- 
ferential equations in O'Neill's program. The final Applesoft program 
was rather large and ran very slowly, says O'Neill, due to the number of 




iterations the program had to go through. 

Using the TASC compiler, O'Neill compiled the Applesoft program 
into machine language and the simulation ran five to six times as fast. 
Still, tracking the movement of the bucket from rest to full speed in the 
scaled-down, nineteen-inch MDIII requires about fourteen hours. By 
contrast, when the actual MDIII is fired, the bucket moves from rest to 
full speed in seven-thousandths of a second. 

O'Neill calls the simulated program he wrote on the Apple M31 and 
says it will be run on a bigger, faster computer soon. M3I helped im- 
mensely in the construction of MDIII. When the performance of the ac- 
tual model and the computer model are compared, they agree closely, 
says O'Neill, differing at the most by only 2 percent. 

Snively and crew arranged several low-power test firings of MDIII 
this May at the Sixth Princeton/SSI Conference on Space Manufactur- 
ing. The demonstrations were very fast — starting and finishing faster

than you can blink. The spoke-wheel-hke bucket would be standing still 
one moment and then, suddenly, it would be at the other end of the 
twenty-inch drive chamber. The bucket travels so fast that its movement 
is virtually undetectable. 

In 2081 , O'Neill talks about another application utilizing the electro- 
magnetic technology found in the Mass- Driver. He predicts that high- 
speed, wingless "floaters" — which ride a cushion of magnetic fields — 
could be the most desirable form of short-distance ground travel in the 
next century. These devices would operate underground in airless tubes 
lined with magnetic coils that would accelerate thin, cylindrical pas- 
senger compartments to speeds as high as eight hundred miles an hour. 

A "floater" ride from New York City to Washington, D.C., would 
take about eight minutes. O'Neill sees this kind of ground transporta- 
tion replacing the current short intercity runs by commercial airlines, 
which are traditionally more economical for longer flights. Several 
decades from now, you or your children may be the "mass" in a kind of 
Mass-Driver system. 

Twenty-first Century Drivers. O'Neill identifies what he calls the 
five "drivers of change" early on in 2081. Computers, automation, space 
colonies, energy, and communications are the five developments that 
O'Neill believes will determine, alone and in combination, the course of 
the next hundred years. 

"As with any technology," O'Neill writes, "that of computers can be 
used either for good or evil, and, unfortunately, some of its applications 
will certainly be evil." Despite this unsettling conclusion, O'Neill does 
not see all dark things for computers in the future. He believes that com- 
puters will become integral to the home and will be much smarter and 
more communicative. 

O'Neill has had nothing but good experiences with the Apple. He 
first became familiar with the machine in the autumn of 1980, when one 
was purchased by the institute for use in keeping track of SSI's members 
and their contributions. O'Neill wrote a program in Applesoft for keep- 
ing track of the foundation's senior associates, those individuals who 
donate between one hundred dollars and five hundred dollars a

year to SSI for five years. 

SSI used O'Neill's program for about eighteen months before one of 
SSI's senior associates donated a commercial program for the task — 
Stoneware's DB Master. That senior associate was, by no mere coinci- 
dence, Barney Stone, one of the coauthors of DB Master. 

O'Neill says the Apple is also used at SSI for general record keeping 
and accounting (via VisiCalc) and word processing (with PIE Writer). 
After trying many different word processing programs, O'Neill settled on 
PIE Writer and has been using it for years. He has just finished another 
book for Simon and Schuster, written entirely on his Apple at home. The 
book, as yet untitled, concerns competition among high-technology com- 
panies and the future of the U.S. economy. It's due out later this year. 

Phoney Apples. The Apple also facilitates telecommunications be- 
tween O'Neill and SSI and his other company, Geostar. O'Neill lives 
both in Palo Alto, California (about 25 percent of the time), and Prince- 
ton. Recently, he took a fourteen-month sabbatical from teaching at 
Princeton to work with a high-energy physics group at Stanford. He took 
his Apple along to fulfill his responsibilities of running SSI, using 
Micro/Courier to communicate with the institute's office in Princeton. 

Geostar is another ambitious project that O'Neill is the driving force 
behind. In late March, Geostar filed an application with the FCC to con- 
struct, launch, and operate a "position location system" based on satel- 
lites in geostationary orbit. 

The Geostar satellite system is based on three satellites orbiting 22,300 
miles above the equator, supercomputers at a single ground location, and 
inexpensive calculator-size transceivers, one for each user. The three satel- 
lites provide the ability to pinpoint accurately within a few meters the 
location of someone carrying a transceiver. The supercomputers accom- 
plish this by comparing the slightly different fimes at which transceiver 



signals are received by each of the satellites. 

Geostar has already raised $1.8 million for the building of the three 
satellites by making a private stock offering, and O'Neill says RCA's 
Astro Electronics division has given the thumbs up on Geostar's design 
after a recent study. The FCC has also awarded the company a fre- 
quency for microwave transmissions. O'Neill sees Geostar being espe- 
cially useful to the trucking industry, airlines, railroads, and public safety 
agencies. The system could also allow transference of data between users 
with portable computers. 

The earliest that we could expect to see the Geostar system in opera- 
tion would be 1987. O'Neill says the time required to build one of the 
satellites is thirty-nine months, once there is enough money. 

The Time Machine. 2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future is a 
fascinating trip through one man's projection of what life in the year 
2081 will be like. 

After going through his p>oLnt-by-point treatise of future life, O'Neill 
reserves a section of his book for "wild cards" — potential developments 
currently on the fringes of known science (psionic powers, time travel, 
contact with extraterrestrials, the harnessing of antimatter, and other 
goodies usually relegated to the realm of science-fiction literature). 

While O'Neill makes passing menfion of these potential break- 
throughs, he spends the majority of his time discussing existing technol- 
ogies — the five drivers of change — and the most likely improvements ; 
we'll see in these technologies in the next one hundred years. 

Trying to predict how we'll travel, and work, and play, and where 
we'll live a hundred years from now is an ambitious task. It's an exercise 
in manipulating ideas, made more palatable by the efforts of O'Neill 
and his colleagues to realize today some of the wonders described 
m 2081. Dl

Jungle Fever, Part 7 



Primary memory — usually in the form of RAM (random access 
memory) — is arguably the most critical resource in your computer sys- 
tem. The Apple Pascal p-machine can access only that program code and 
data that occupy primary memory. Until copied into primary memory, 
material stored on disk or any other form of secondary memory remains 
invisible to the p-machine. 

A computer that contains a large amount of primary memory can ac- 
commodate larger programs and can manipulate more data at high 
speed than can a less generously endowed machine. In the Apple II 
computer equipped with a language card, around 36K of primary 
memory is free to hold your Pascal programs and data. The memory that 
remains is occupied by the p-machine simulator program and the Apple 
Pascal operating system. 

To get a more precise estimate of the amount of primary memory 
available to you (whether you are using an Apple II, He, or III), compile 
and execute the following one-line program: 

PROGRAM Free; BEGIN WriteLn(MemAvail) END. 

As we have seen in previous months, MemAvail is a built-in function that 
returns a reasonably accurate approximation of the number of memory 
words (half the number of bytes) that remain unused at the time 
of the function call. (Why MemAvail can never be exact is properly the 
concern of a course in the design and implementation of computer op- 
erating systems; we are not yet ready to consider such matters.) 

No Apple computer that runs unabridged Apple Pascal offers less 
than about 36K of primary memory for your programs and data. Un- 
fortunately, while this may sound like an impressive amount of memory 
at first blush, it can be filled rather quickly by even a modest program, 
especially one that employs a good-sized ARRAY OF RECORD. 

At some point, then, you will certainly write a program that needs 
more primary memory than you have. Most often, you'll become aware 
of this situation when your program causes a "stack overflow," which is 
Apple Pascal's unfortunate (and rude) way of saying, "Enough is 
enough!" Sometimes, the system indicates a "stack overflow" condition 
by putting a special error message on-screen. At other times, the com- 
puter simply has what appears to be a spontaneous seizure, character- 
ized by an automatic reset of the equipment. 

If your program and its data together consume more memory space 
than your computer provides, don't despair; Apple Pascal supports two 
techniques you may use to squeeze your program into thg~avail- 
able space. These techniques are data segmentation and program 
segmentation. 

In data segmentation, you leave all the program code in primary 
memory but process only a small amount of data at a time. The inactive 
portion of the data is stored until needed in a FILE that is maintained on 
a secondary memory device, such as a floppy disk. A program that uses 
data segmentation must shufile data between primary and secondary 
memory as often as is necessary to expedite processing. In some com- 



puter environments, data shuffling is handled by the operating system 
through a so-called "virtual memory" scheme, whereby a secondary 
memory file is used to simulate a larger primary memory. In Apple Pas- 
cal, however, your program must handle data segmentation through ex- 
plicit data structures and FILE access. 

Program segmentation permits you to maintain large amounts of da- 
ta in primary memory by reducing the amount of memory needed for 
program code. With this method, you divide the program into smaller, 
semi-independent subprograms, called code segments. Apple Pascal auto- 
matically ensures that each code segment occupies primary memory on- 
ly while it is being executed. When one segment finishes its work, it is re- 
placed in primary memory by another. Thus, a segmented program tends 
to occupy much less memory at execution time than an unsegmented 
program of similar size and complexity. This leaves more room for data. 

Data and program segmentation techniques enable your Apple to ac- 
commodate larger programs and greater amounts of data than would 
normally fit into its primary memory. There's a price to be paid, how- 
ever. Programs that use secondary memory generally run much more 
slowly than programs that do not. Secondary memory is more sluggish 
than primary memory, usually because primary memory is completely 
electronic and involves no moving parts (other than electrons, which 
move at almost the speed of light), while secondary memory — a disk 
drive, for example — often incorporates mechanical devices that are rela- 
tively slow. For instance, the Apple's p-machine can acquire a piece of 
data from its primary memory in a few thousandths of a second. Get- 
ting the same data from a dormant floppy disk drive may take a second 
or so, especially when drive start-up time is taken into consideration. As 
you can well imagine, the more a program must rely on segmentation 
techniques and secondary memory, the slower it will be. 

While some programs use either data or program segmentation ex- 
clusively, most serious programs involve a combination of the two tech- 
niques. Therefore, we will examine them both over the next few months. 
We'll start with a look at Apple Pascal's facilities for program segmenta- 
tion, progressing in later months to data segmentation and advanced 
FI LE access. 

Program Segmentation. From previous discussions, you know that 
Pascal programs are kept on disks or other secondary storage media in 
the form of p-code files until you choose to execute them. At your com- 
mand, the Pascal system retrieves an executable program from the code 
file in which it resides and then copies the p-codes into primary memory. 
Usually, an entire program is copied into memory at once, but you may 
elect to divide your programs into two or more code segments if you 
prefer. 

The Pascal system loads a code segment into primary memory only 
when it is needed. So long as a segment resides in primary memory, it is 
said to be "swapped in." Idle segments remain on disk until they are 
summoned during execution, in the process replacing one or more seg- 
ments that are no longer in use. A discarded segment is said to be 
"swapped out," even though the copy of it in primary memory actually 



242 



SEPTEMBER 1983 



goes nowhere. Instead, that code is simply destroyed — overwritten by in- 
coming segments, perhaps. After ail, an inactive segment may always be 
reloaded from disk whenever it is needed again. 

In Apple Pascal, the keyword SEGMENT may precede a PROCE- 
DURE or FUNCTION heading, and it designates the following sub- 
routine as a code segment. The p-code for this subroutine remains on 
disk until the subroutine is called. The code for any procedure or func- 
tion declared within a segment subroutine is also part of that segment. 
Thus, a code segment may include a bundle of related subroutines. The 
entire aggregate stays in secondary memory until the segment's primary 
(outermost) subroutine is called. 

An Example of Segmentation: The Screen Editor. The Apple Pas- 
cal screen editor is divided into seven segments, as shown in the accom- 
panying figure. The designers of Apple Pascal knew that quick, conven- 
ient text editing would be possible on a microprocessor-based system only 
if all the text being edited could be stored and manipulated in primary 
memory at once. Thus, the editor had to provide for an extensive text 
buffer (on the order of several thousand characters at least). The larger 
the buffer, the larger the text file that could be created and modified us- 
ing the editor. On the other hand, a large text buffer left little primary 
memory for the editor program itself! In the end, a balance had to be 
struck. The most convenient, commonly used editor functions were 
grouped together in one large code segment, so that switching between 
them would not involve any time-consuming disk accesses that would de- 
grade the editor's performance. This crucial segment was named the 
EDITCORE. 

In addition to EDITCORE, other segments were established to han- 
dle less frequently used aspects of the editor. For instance, when you elect 
to Set the Environment (as described in Chapter 4 of the Apple Pascal 
Operating System Reference Manual), the EDITCORE segment is 
swapped out and the ENVIRONMENT segment is swapped in. When 
you regain the editor main prompt line, you reverse this process. When 
you Quit the editor, the EDITCORE segment is again swapped out, and 
the segment named OUT is swapped in. Whenever you see the editor 
prompt line or are using any of the common editing commands, such as

TEXT BUFFER 



Insert, Delete, or eXchange, the EDITCORE segment is executing in pri- 
mary memory and tiie otiier segments are swapped out, awaiting their 
turn to be loaded in and executed. The editor's huge text buffer, how- 
ever, remains in primary memory at ail times and is always available to 
the code segment that happens to be swapped in at any particular 
moment. 

EDITCORE is much larger than any of the editor's other code seg- 
ments, primarily because the complement of functions deemed essential 
by the system designers could be realized only by using hundreds of lines 
of Pascal code. The size of EDITCORE has always set an uncomfort- 
ably confining upper bound on the amount of text you can manipulate 
with the editor at one sitting. On the other hand, the text buffer would be 
only about half its current size if it had to share primary memory with all 
of the editor's code segments simultaneously.

Experiment with two versions of this program: one that includes the 
SEGMENT iceywords as shown here, and one that does not. Time the 
two programs to see how crippling arbitrary segmentation can be. Obvi- 
ously, it is generally a bad idea to initiate frequent segment swaps during 
periods of heavy computation! Instead, you should organize your code 
so that segment swaps occur infrequently and at times when a slight 
pause is psychologically acceptable to the human beings that use your 
programs. In the screen editor, for example, segment swaps occur when- 
ever you want to Set the Environment or Quit the editor, but not while 
you are using the common text-manipulation commands. There is a kind 
of "mental pause" implied by someone's decision to change the editor's 
internal settings, or to quit editing altogether. In such situations, the user 
may very well notice the delay in program response that is engendered by 
a segment swap, but she will probably find it easy to ignore the brief in- 
terruption. On the other hand, she is likely to be acutely conscious of un- 
comfortable delays in the editing process if segment swaps occur while she 
tries to use the most common text-manipulation commands, such as In- 
sert, Delete, and eXchange. 

FORWARD Declarations. According to the rules of Apple Pascal, 
no "regular" subroutine may be defined at any given level of procedure 
nesting within a program until any and all segment subroutines at that 
same level have been defined. This means, for instance, that the follow- 
ing skeleton describes an illegal program: 

PROGRAM 
BadOrder; 

(* Utility function— used almost everywhere *) 
FUNCTION 
Capital(Gh: Char) 

:Char; 
BEGIN (* Capital ') 
IF (Ch IN ['a' . . 'z']) 
THEN 

Capital : =Chr(0rd(Ch)-0rd('a') + 0rdCA')) 
ELSE 

Capital : = Ch; 
END (* Capital *); 

SEGMENT PROCEDURE (* Compiler will complain at this line *) 

Activelngredient; 
BEGIN (* Activelngredient *) 

(* Some useful code goes here— presumably, it uses Capital. *) 
END (* Activelngredient *); 

(* Perhaps some other regular subroutines and maybe 
even some more SEGMENT routines, as well ...'*) 

BEGIN (* BadOrder *) 

(* Some useful code goes here — presumably^ 

it uses Capital, too! *) 
END (* BadOrder *). 

Attempts to compile programs modeled after BadOrder will fail. The 
compiler will refuse to generate a code file, complaining of error condi- 
tion 399 ("implementation restriction"). 

We could solve the problem by moving Capital below Activelngre- 
dient in the source text. However, Activelngredient could not then use

SEPTEMBER 1983 

Capital, unless it included its own redundant copy of that routine within 
its local declaration area. This would be a sloppy and wasteful way of re- 
solving our difficulty, since an unnecessary duplicate of Capital would 
occupy precious primary memory at execution time whenever Activeln- 
gredient was swapped in. 

Nothing keeps a segment subroutine from calling and using a regu- 
lar subroutine such as Capital except the rule that segment subroutines 
must be defined before regular ones. 

Fortunately, Apple Pascal draws an important distinction between 
the declaration of a subroutine and its definition. Usually, declaration and 
definition happen simultaneously. The heading of a PROCEDURE or 
FUNCTION declares your intention to define and use a particular sub- 
routine and is customarily followed by the (optional) declaration section 
and by a main body. These last two items constitute the definition of a 
subroutine. 

The Pascal keyword FORWARD enables you to separate subrou- 
tine declaration from definition. To declare a subroutine using this meth- 
od, you specify its PROCEDURE or FUNCTION heading, including 
any parameter list and FUNCTION result type, just as you would nor- 
mally. Instead of following this heading with a declaration section and a 
body of code, however, you write the keyword FORWARD and follow 
that with a semicolon. 

To define a subroutine that has already been declared FORWARD, 
you issue an abbreviated heading that consists only of one of the key- 
words, PROCEDURE or FUNCTION (whichever is appropriate), fol- 
lowed by the identifier that names the subroutine and then by a semi- 
colon. After this comes the postponed declaration section (if any) and, of 
course, the complete subroutine body. Note that if you fail to provide a 
definition that matches a FORWARD declaration, the compiler will 
complain of error condition 117 ("unsafisfied forward reference"). 

Now, we can place the declaration of Capital before Activelngredient 
and the definition afterward: 

PROGRAM 
GoodOrder; 

(* Utility function — used almost everywhere *) 



FUNCTION 
Capital(Ch: Char) 
:Char; 

FORWARD;(* Notice that the full subroutine heading, including 
parameter list and function result type, are used 
in the DECLARATION.*) 
SEGMENT PROCEDURE 

Activelngredient: 
BEGIN (* Activelngredient *) 

(*Some useful code goes here— presumably, it uses Capital, *) 
END (' Activelngredient *); 
(* Any other SEGMENT routines go here . . . *) 
FUNCTION 

Capital; (* Notice the abbreviated form of subroutine heading 
that is used in the DEFINITION. *) 
BEGIN (* Capital *) 
IF (Ch IN ['a' . . 'z']) 
THEN 

Capital :=Chr(Ord(Ch)-Ord('a')+OrdCA')) 
ELSE 
Capital : = Ch; 
END (* Capital *); 

(* Any other regular routines that may need to use Capital go 

here . . . *) 
BEGIN (* GoodOrder *) 
(* Some useful code goes here — presumably, it uses Capital, too! *) 
END (* GoodOrder*). 
By using the FORWARD declaration, we manage to obey the rule 
requiring that "segment definitions come first," while at the same time 
we permit Capital to be global to the enfire program, including segment 
subroutines. 

A Digression: Mutual Recursion. Not only does the FORWARD 
declaration allow you to establish regular subroutines that can be called 
by segment subroutines without violating the "segments come first" rule, 
it also enables you to write mutually recursive subroutines. That is, using 
the FORWARD declaration, you can write a subroutine A, which calls a 
subroutine B, which calls a subroutine A, which calls a subroutine B, and 
so on. 

Consider, for example, the task of recognizing a statement in a com- 



The"HowTo's"of Software Production 



How to double your 
revenues 

Believe it or not, there are five to ten 
bootlegged copies for every program disk- 
ette sold legally. An effective, hardware- 
based copy protection method is the best 
way to convert freeloaders into customers. 

How to protect your 
reputation 

Every diskette you ship should work 
under even marginal conditions. Special- 
purpose equipment designed for high- 
precision recording and verification will 
give you the edge in product quality. 

How to reduce your 
costs 

Rugged, high-performance diskette dupli- 
cation equipment is mandatory for high- 
volume software production. Look for 
speed, reliability, and foolproof operator 
simplicity. 




The FORMASTER Series One Intelligent 
diskette duplicator produces up to 326 
fully verified copies per hour, with Copy- 
Lock™ piracy protection and copy serial- 
ization added automatically. 



How to expand your 
business 

As your programs become more suc- 
cessful, you'll want to develop versions for 
different computers. Your duplication 
equipment should handle all diskette for- 
mats, including complex GCR encodings 
such as Apple, Commodore, and Victor.

puter programming language like Pascal. Perhaps a general routine that 
validates a "statement" does its work by calling specialized routines that 
recognize different types of statements. One such subroutine would recog- 
nize an IF statement, another would recognize an assignment statement, 
while still another would handle a compound statement, and so on. Yet in 
Pascal-like languages, IF statements and compound statements can 
usually themselves contain statements. Consequently, the subroutines 
that handled such specialized constructs would have to call the general 
statement-recognition routine. Computer scientists would say that the 
generalized subroutine and its specialized subordinate routines are mu- 
tually recursive. 

You could not write mutually recursive subroutines in Apple Pas- 
cal were it not for the FORWARD-declaration facility. At any point 
during the compilation process, the compiler prevents your program 
from calling any subroutine that has not already been declared. In such 
situations, you'll be notified of error condition 104 ("undeclared identi- 
fier"). Given this restriction, it is clearly impossible io define the bodies of 
two routines that call each other without first declaring at least one of 
them. If you could not postpone the definition of one of the routines, you 
could not define its partner. 

Segment Nesting. Segment subroutines may be declared and de- 
fined within the declaration sections of other segment subroutines. Of 
course, segment procedures and functions must be the first subroutines 
defined in any declaration area, in keeping with the "segments first" rule 
we have already discussed. 

Suppose, though, that SEGMENT PROCEDURE B is nested with- 
in SEGMENT PROCEDURE A. In other words, suppose that the 
definition for B is contained within A's declaration section. This does not 
imply that the code for B is also loaded into primary memory when A is 
called. Instead, B is treated as the independent code segment that it is. B's 
code is left on disk until such time as B is called by A (or by one of the 
subroutines that are local to A and global to B). 

Segment Number Assignments. We have long acknowledged that the 
Apple speaks a language of numbers that is almost wholly divorced from 
more commonly understood languages such as English. So, it should 



come as no surprise that the compiler automatically assigns a unique 
number to each code segment, for purposes of identification at the level of 
the p-machine. The main program body and all regular subroutines as- 
sociated with it are collected in segment 1. This s^ment is always resi- 
dent in primary memory. Other segments are assigned numbers on a 
"first-come, first-served basis," in ascending order beginning at 7 and. 
ending at 31. (Segment numbers 2 through 6 are reserved for system com-' 
ponents.) Although this implies that your programs may be divided into 
twenty-six separate code segments, limitations of Apple Pascal system 
design restrict the number of explicit segment subroutines in any one 
program to sixteen. Thus, the numbers assigned to code segments in your 
programs will normally range from 7 to 21. (This numbering scheme is 
upset if you use any UNITs, but we won't discuss this aspect of the sys- 
tem for some time.) You can see graphic evidence of the compiler's seg- 
ment-numbering policy by looking back to the compiler-generated list- 
ing for Sluggish. Notice that the main program body is associated with 
segment number 1, SEGMENT PROCEDURE P with the number 7, 
and SEGMENT FUNCTION F with the number 8. 

A "New" Compiler Directive. The $R compiler directive instruc- 
tion, which has up to now been used with a "switch" argument (-1- or -) 
to control the automatic generation of range-checking code, may also be 
given an arbitrary character string as an argument. The compiler inter- 
prets this string as the name of a SEGMENT PROCEDURE or SEG- 
MENT FUNCTION. The $R instruction must occur at the beginning ofi 
a body of code, immediately following the keyword BEGIN and ahead of' 
any Pascal statements that the compiler would translate into p-code. $R i 
forces the Pascal system to load the specified code segment into primary 
memory and to leave it there until the subroutine containing the $R in- 
struction completes its execution. In other words, the $R instruction tem-i 
porarily "freezes" a code segment in primary memory, defeating the Pas- 
cal system's automatic segment-swapping behavior. Thus, this compiler 
directive instruction enables a particular subroutine to call a segment 
subroutine as often as necessary without incurring segment-swapping 
delays. 

Earlier, we examined the inefficient use of segmentation in the pro- 
gram Sluggish. Here is another version of that program, which executes 
almost as quickly as the unsegmented one by virtue of including a strate- 
gically placed $R compiler directive instruction:

In NSIuggish, two separate compiler directives were used to control 
the "residency" of the code segments P and F. The addendum to iht Ap- 
ple Pascal Language Reference Manual implies that the two directives 
could have been combined into the single directive "(*$R P,F*)", and

this is certainly the case in Apple II Pascal, where one $R instruction may 
be used to control the swapping behavior of any number of code seg- 
ments. The argument to $R in Apple I! Pascal may be either a single 
name or a list of names such that each item is separated from its suc- 
cessor by a comma. However, the Pascal compiler for the Apple III per- 
mits only one name to follow the $R instruction. Thus, the "(*$R P,F*)" 
directive is perceived by the Apple III compiler as containing two sepa- 
rate instructions, $R and $F. The latter instruction is undocumented in 
the Apple III Pascal manuals and forces the Apple III compiler to gen- 
erate code for a p-machine that runs on a different computer system. 
Quite understandably, Apple III Pascal would refuse to execute the alien 
product of such a compilation. Use of two separate compiler directives 
renders the source text compatible with both the Apple II and Apple III 
Pascal compilers. 

The $R instruction allows you to optimize both memory usage and 
execution speed. You may declare procedures and functions as code seg- 
ments, then rely on the automatic mechanisms of Apple Pascal to swap 
these segments in and out of primary memory as appropriate during pro- 
gram execution, thus conserving primary memory at the cost of execu- 
tion speed. However, at points where memory is not so crowded and 
quicker execution is desirable, $R can disable segment swaps, thereby 
providing marked improvement in a program's performance. 

Note that you need not issue the $R compiler directive instruction in 
a recursive segment subroutine — that is, in a segment subroutine that 
calls itself, either directly or indirectly (through mutual recursion). A 
code segment remains in primary memory until the original call to it is 
resolved. It does not need to be reloaded for subsequent recursive calls; 
instead, the original copy of the subroutine code is used (as is always the 
case with recursive execution, whether or not program segmentation is 
involved). 

Programmed Control of Segment Swapping. It may not be immedi- 
ately obvious, but the $R instruction may also be used to enable or dis- 
able code segment swapping under program control. Here is yet another 
version of the Sluggish program that demonstrates the proper technique:

LOCK-IT-UP 

DISKETTE COPY-PROTECTION 
AND DUPLICATION SYSTEMS 
FOR THE APPLE COMPUTER 

The Lock-lt-Up systems are sophisticated, menu driven 
copy-protection and duplication utilities for the Apple II 
Computer. They feature several levels of protection which 
make standard diskettes uncopyable by even the most 
sophisticated nibble copy programs currently available. 

• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Data files can be loaded and/or saved to either the protected diskette 
or an unprotected diskette. 

• Memory will be cleared and the disk will reboot If the reset key is 
pushed. 

• The copying systems support up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data-verification is optional during copy. 

• Sequential serial numbers are assigned to each diskette produced by 
the system 

• Master diskettes created with the system contain an I.D. stamp that 
you select. The I.D. stamp must be correctly specified before any 
diskettes can be duplicated. This prevents other Lock-lt-Up owners 
from copying your diskettes. 

• Extensive support is provided should you have any problems or 
special needs. 

• Our system is supported by numerous disk copying services should 
you need a large quantity of diskettes duplicated. 

Either system is available for $225, which includes three diskettes, an 
informative manual, and a non-exclusive license to copy as many 
diskettes as needed.

Remember, $R forces the specified code segment(s) to reside in pri- 
mary memory until tiie subroutine in which the $R instruction occurs 
finishes its execution. The procedure NoSwapCompute includes an $R 
instruction that fixes P and F in primary memory. It then calls Compute 
to do the program's real work. If the user selects nonswapping opera- 
tion. Compute is called through NoSwapCompute. Otherwise, Compute 
is called directly. A more complex version of this scheme was used in 
writing the Pascal compiler, permitting you to control the compiler's 
code-swapping behavior by means of the $S compiler directive instruc- 
tion. As far as your own work is concerned, you may even couple the 



"dynamic swapping" technique with a check of Mem Avail to produce 
programs that can decide to conserve memory through segment swap- 
ping when running on 64K Apple II Plus and He systems but to eschew 
swapping in favor of more rapid execution on a 128K He or a 256K Ap- 
ple HI. 

Control of Segment Number Assignment. With the $NS instruc- 
tion, you may direct the compiler to assign a particular number to a code 
segment. One of the compiler's global variables is a counter that deter- 
mines the number to be given to the next code segment constructed dur- 
ing the compilation process. As soon as the compiler is invoked, the 
counter is set to I. That number is assigned to the main program seg- 
ment, and immediately the counter's value is increased to 7. Normally, 
the segment counter is then automatically incremented by one as the 
compiler encounters each new code segment. The compiler directive 
"(*$NS n*)", where n is an Integer from 1 to 30, tells the compiler to 
change the segment counter's value to n. This does not change the num- 
ber of the segment that is currently under construction. In particular, 
since the main program segment is considered as "under construction" at 
the instant that the compiler is invoked (and before any compiler direc- 
tive instructions can be recognized), you cannot use $NS to change the 
value of the main program's segment number, which must always be 1. 
Furthermore, the argument to $NS must always be greater than the cur- 
rent number in the segment counter, or the $NS instruction will be 
ignored (in Apple II Pascal version 1 . 1 , that is; error condition 274 will be 
reported by Apple III Pascal in the same situation). Since the segment 
counter is increased to 7 as soon as the number 1 is assigned to the main 
segment, $NS may not be used to produce segments numbered 2 through 6. 

The $NS instruction is obviously of limited utility, even to experi- 
enced programmers. It is presented here merely for completeness. Only 
programmers responsible for certain components of the Apple Pascal 
operating system are customarily concerned with segment number as- 
signments anyway. The rest of us usually don't (and shouldn't) care 
about such details; the compiler's automatic behavior should never at- 
tract our attention unless and until it somehow prevents us from achiev- 
ing our programming goals.

The two previous articles in this series have described differences be- 
tween the Apple II and Apple III hardware that affect the Emulation 
mode, the organization of the Basic and Monitor images on the Emula- 
tion disk, and changes in the Monitor and games programs that make it 
possible to play many Apple II games on the Apple III. Now we'll delve 
more deeply into the Emulation program itself to discover further varia- 
tions of the Emulation Apple. The first, with lower-case character dis- 
play and keyboard entry, permits the use of programs that use lower-case 
display. This includes programs for the Apple He that don't require the 
eighty-column card. More exotic configurations include 60K of RAM 
and the use of Apple II software in an Apple III hardware environment, 
with delightful and novel results. 

When the Emulation program boots, the first twelve disk blocks are 
loaded in sequence to install the program into the address range SAOOO 
through $B677. (Block 0 occupies SAOOO through $A1FF; block 1 fills 



$A200 through $A3FF, and so forth.) The program is an interesting ap- 
plication of the "memory is cheap, but code is expensive" approach. 
Code segments are in SAOOO through $A3C4 and $A4C7 through 
SA67D. The rest consists mostly of the two text screen images, complete 
with all the spaces. 

First, let's install a new character set and keyboard handler so we can 
use programs written for an Apple with lower-case display, including 
some new programs written for the Apple He. 

Installation and use of a character set with lower case involves three 
types of changes to the Emulation mode. The first is the installation of 
the character set, which is a modification of the Emulation program. The 
second is the modification of the KEYIN routine in the Apple II Moni- 
tor so that it will read and interpret both bytes from the Apple III key- 
board. The third is the treatment of inverse and flashing modes in a con- 
sistent way. This involves some decisions about what type of consistency 



you want and how much work you are willing to do to achieve it. 

The problem with inverse and flashing characters arises because there 
are only 256 character codes recognized by the character generator. The 
Apple II normally displays sixty-four characters, which are translated 
into sixty-four character codes for inverse, sixty-four for flashing, and 
two normal sets. Adding lower case expands the character set to ninety- 
six characters. You can't have full sets of inverse, flashing, and normal 
characters, because there are too few character codes. Something has to 
give. You can settle for inverse or flashing display of the wrong charac- 
ter part of the time, but the most satisfactory solution is to eliminate the 
flashing mode entirely. 

A simple program will display the entire character set on the screen. 
It is written in Integer Basic, as are the other Basic programs in these ar- 
ticles. Integer Basic is useful for applications that involve modifications 
of binary files, because it includes the Miniassembler and can include 



other utilities in the $0800 through $DFFF address space. 
First, clear the screen: 

100 CALL -936 

Next, set up a loop to poke eight rows, each containing thirty-two 
character codes, directly to the screen memory locations. 

120 FOR R = 0 TO 7 
140 l = R + 1+R/2 
160 FOR X = 0 TO 31 
180 C = 32*R + X 

The variable C is the character code. The character displayed does 
not have to be the one suggested by the corresponding ASCII value, as is 
clear from the absence of lower-case letters in the Apple II character set. 
Next, calculate the screen addresses and poke in the characters.

The Apple III character generator uses 128 character images to gen- 
erate the 256 displayed characters. Each character image does double 
duty, once in the normal character set, with its character code larger than 
128, and again in the inverse set, with the character code 128 less than the 
corresponding normal code. On the distributed Emulation disk, the 
images in one si.xty-four-character set have the most significant bit of 
every byte set, so that the characters will flash in the inverse mode. (See 
the Standard De\ice Drivers Manual, page 166.) When the lower-case let- 
ters are added, they must appear in either inverse or flashing format for 
character codes 97 through 127 and in normal display for character 
codes 225 through 255. The character ROM in the Apple II has 256 
characters, giving more freedom in character-set design. 

The easiest way to make a new character set is to start with one that 
is already nearly what you want. Several commercial graphics packages 
for the Apple include full character sets in the proper format. Two ex- 
amples are the Apple DOS Tool Kit and the Penguin Complete Graphics 
System. 



You can use the character-editing program, Charedit, shown in 
listing 1, to examine and modify character sets. The program has an ini- 
tial menu that allows you to select the character-set editor or hex-deci- 
mal conversion utilities that are a byproduct of the normal program 
operation. Select option 1, and type in the starting address of the part of 
the character set you want to examine. The characters will begin to scroll 
by, with an address label for each byte. To make changes, press a key. 
Two keys, C and S, have special uses. They give you the option to clear 
or set the flashing bit over a range of addresses. Hitting any other key 
yields a request to enter the address of a byte to edit. If you don't want to 
edit anything, enter 0 to return to the request for a display address. AO 
response to this request ends the program. 

The Apple II character set in the Emulation program is in $AA86 
through $AE85. Use the Trackmover program, presented in the first ar- 
ticle, to load track 0 from an Emulation disk at $4000. Each character 
occupies an eight-byte cell, one byte for each horizontal row of dots. As 
furnished, the characters sit in the bottom seven rows of the display 
space, and the top row is blank. To provide for lower-case descenders, 
the characters have to be moved to the top of their display windows. The 
Monitor provides a quick fix: 



5000<4A87.4E85M 
53FF:0 



I 



These instructions move the character set to S5000 for editing, removing 
the first byte and adding a blank byte at the end. The effert is to move 
every character to the top of its display window. 

The Charedit program can be used to examine and edit the character 
set. The first SIFF bytes have the flashing bit clear, and the next $200 
have the flashing bit set. Providing for descenders moved the tops of the 
upper-case characters to hex addresses that end in 0 or 8 and displaced 
the alignment of the flashing bits from the character cells by one byte. 
Use the C option to clear the flashing bits in S51FF through $53FF. The 
character cell that will become the letter "a" begins at S5308, corre-. 
spending with ASCII code 97. 

The DOS Tool Kit character set has ninety-six characters. If you load 
it at $3000, the "a" is at $3208. Use the Monitor move command, 
5308<3208.32FFM, to add it to the new character set. The Penguin char- 
acter set has 128 characters, so the lower case starts at $3308 if you fol- 
low a similar procedure. If you use another commercial graphics charac- 
ter set, use Charedit to determine the lower-case character location. 

Check the new characters for flashing bits, edit any characters you 
think should be changed, and return the character set to the Emulation 
program with 4A86 < 5000.53FFM. Use the Trackmover program to 
restore the modified Emulation program to your lower-case Emula- 
tion disk. 

With the new character set installed, you can display lower-case char- 
acters in programs that already have them, but you can't enter them 
from the keyboard. The Monitor reads only one of the two bytes re- 
quired to decode the keyboard. It doesn't know that the shift and alpha 
lock keys exist. 

A revised Monitor KEYIN subroutine and a few minor patches in 
the character handling elsewhere will remedy the problem. The KEYIN3 
subroutine is shown in listing 2. To install it, load track 5 from your 
lower-case Emulation disk at address $5000 and track 9 at address $4000. 
Bload KEYIN3,A$59FE ($FEFE when the Monitor is loaded in its 
proper location). Four small changes will complete the Monitor 
modifications. 

The RDKEY subroutine, at $FD0C, normally converts characters to 
flashing mode when the cursor backs over them. If it is unchanged, the 
flashing versions of the lower-case characters become a confusmg assort- 
ment of inverse numbers and punctuation marks, and the numbers be- 
come inverse lower-case letters. All characters will be converted to 
proper inverses if three bytes are altered:

SEPTEMBER 1983 



Modify the track 5 memory image from the IVlonitor with 5812:7F 
EA EA. 

In the Monitor KEYIN routine, replace the instruction to read the 
i<eyboard with a jump to the new KEYIN3 routine. The Monitor com- 
mand 5828:4C EE EE will replace the LDA SCOOO (AD 00 CO) with 
J MP SFEFE. All character input to the Monitor is converted to upper 
case by an AND #$DF (29 DP) instruction at $FD82. The Monitor 
won't interpret lower case, and it isn't likely that this part of the Moni- 
tor is used by other programs. The conversion can be eliminated with 
5882:EA EA if you want to be able to enter lower case in the Monitor 
anyway. 

A routine to store $3E in the inverse flag location at $32 should be 
changed to store $7F instead. Enter 5982:7F to modify the track 5 image. 
This completes the modification of the Monitor image used with Integer 
Basic. Copy the modified Monitor to the Applesoft version with 
4300 < 5800.5AFFM. Then write the modified tracks 5 (from $5000) 
and 9 (from $4(XX)) back on the Emulation disk. 

With the character set installed in the Emulation program and the 
Monitor patched for lower-case entry, one further change is needed on 
the Emulation disk. The Applesoft inverse and flash commands should 
also be made to produce readable output. The Pattern Location pro- 
gram, presented in the second article as a tool for locating paddle rou- 
tines in games, serves equally well to analyze the inverse and flash com- 
mands in Applesoft. Since we know that the inverse flag is stored in $32, 
one of three commands must put the value there: STY $32(84 32), STA 
$32 (85 32), or STX $32(86 32). Without much difficulty, we can locate

to match the changes made on the Emulation disk. It is usually easy to 
find the responsible routine. Just search for the ORA #$40 (09 40) com- 
mand that sets the flashing mode in the normal character set. Most of 
these programs use the Monitor KEYIN subroutine to read the key- 
board, so they will automatically accept lower-case characters after you 
have modified the Emulation disk. 

Exotic Emulation. Let's look at the hardware setup that accom- 
panies the Emulation mode and see what changes might produce useful 
results. Here is the instruction sequence that turns on the Emulation 
mode: 

;$FFDO is the zero-page control register, 
A56F- A9 00 LDA #$00 ;Selectzero page = 0. 

A571-8DD0FF STA$FFD0 



;$FFDF is the environment control register.

;$FFE3 is the data direction register for the 
;A port of the E VIA. Set the 
; Emulation bit to output status, so the 
;STA $FFEF will turn on Emulation.

Table 1 describes the uses of the bits in the environment register 
(SFFDF). It originally appeared in "HI Bits: John Jeppson's Guided 
Tour of Highway III" (May 1983 Softalk). That article is an excellent 
reference concerning the Apple III hardware features. 



It looks like everything needed is right here. Changing $F278 from 
$3F to $7F should fix the inverse problem. Further, it app>ears that ad- 
dress $F3 must be used for the flashing mode. We could store a zero in 
$F3 all the time, but this would waste a valuable page 0 location. A bet- 
ter solution is to eliminate its use in the output routine. Looking for 
ORA $F3 (05 F3) quickly shows the route: 

DB62- 05 F3 0RA$F3 
DB64- 20 EDFD JSR$FDED 

Replace the ORA instruction with a pair of NOP instructions and the 
Hashing mode disappears. The flashing and inverse modes both yield in- 
verses of the desired characters. 

These changes to Applesoft must be made on two different disk 
tracks. Load tracks 7 and 8 in addresses $4(XX) through $5FFF. Go to 
the Monitor and type 5878:7F and then 587D:EA EA to make the first 
change. Type 4162:EA EA to eliminate the ORA instruction, and write 
both tracks back on the Emulation disk. With these changes, the Apple- 
soft inverse and flash commands both produce the inverse of the desired 
character. Since Integer Basic doesn't have these commands, no more 
changes are required. The lower-case Emulation disk is complete. 

With these changes, the control-character codes, 0 through 31 and 
128 through 159, have no role in normal character displays. You can 
create your own special characters to go with these codes. You can use 
the inverse flag, poke 50,31, to print the inverse control characters, but 
you will need your own routine to place the normal ones on the screen. 

Many Apple II editors, both for Basic (such as PLE or GPLE) and 
in editor/;issembler packages, generate the flashing cursor internally and 
will show inverse lower case when the cursor goes over numbers. If you 
use one frequently, you will probably want to change the cursor routine

Table 1. Environment register ($FFDF) description. 



When the environment is set to $FC, the clock speed is 1 MHz; the 
I/O, video, and reset key are all enabled; the memory in $C000 through 
$FFFF is write-protected to behave as if it were ROM; the true ($0100) 
stack is used, and the ROM is deselected. Two changes look tempting 
immediately. One is to install RAM in the $C000 through $FFFF 
memory space, and the other is to run the "Apple 11" at 2 MHz. Both are 
feasible, with the important limitation that most Apple III I/O requires 
the 1 MHz clock, so we can't set the Emulation mode clock permanent- 
ly at 2 MHz. 

The installation of RAM in high memory allows the use of a limited 
selection of language-card software. There are two restrictions: 

1 . There is no bank selection in the $D000 through $DFFF memo- 
ry range, so programs that use the extra memory bank can't be 
used. 

2. Programs that switch back and forth between the language card 
and ROM memories won't work. This includes the language-card 
DOS, for example. 

To use the all-RA M Emulation mode, you must disable a nasty func- 
tion in DOS 3.3. During the boot process, DOS stores a zero in $E000. 
The zero is supposed to be in the language card, but the language-card 



SEPTEMBER 1983 S C) P T A L K te 257 



control instructions don't do anything in the Apple III. In normal Emu- 
lation mode, the memory is write-protected, so the store instruction has 
no effect. 

A disk that already contains DOS can be fixed with the aid of the 
Trackmover program. Read track 0 into memory at address $5000. The 
Monitor command 56D3:EA EA EA replaces the unwanted instruction 
with three NOPs. Rewrite track 0 on any DOS 3.3 disk that you want to 
use with RAM in high memory. Disks initialized by the modified DOS 
will have the same DOS changes. Since the language-card initialization is 
useless in Emulation mode, it can be eliminated from any disk you expect 
to use exclusively on the Apple III. 

After you have a disk that will boot DOS without destroying Basic, a 
one-byte change of the Emulation program will select Emulation mode 
without write-protecting the high memory. Read track 0 of the Emula- 
tion disk into memory at $4000. Use the Monitor command 4575:F4 to 
change the value in the environment register from $FC to $F4 and re- 
write track 0 on the disk. The change eliminates the high-memory write 
protection without changing any other part of the Emulation setup. 

As a finale, we consider a Hybrid mode, in which Apple II software 
has full control of the Apple III environment. Advantages include num- 
ber crunching, access to the 6502 and system clocks, experimentation 
with Apple III hardware, and some novelty features. Applesoft at 2 MHz 
is faster than Business Basic, because there is no memory management 
overhead. The system clock normally cannot be read in Emulation 
mode, because the zero-page register switches the output bytes. Experi- 
mentation with routines to control Apple III hardware is easier in the 
simpler Apple II software environment than under SOS. The color text 
display mode is a delightful novelty. It would be welcome on the real 
Apple II. 

There are some important limitations to the Hybrid mode, too. It's 
not an environment for big software projects or for most commercial 
programs. DOS 3.3 won't select drive 2 in the Hybrid mode, and only 
three of the Apple 111 video modes are usable with Apple II software. 

A two-byte change in the Emulation program eliminates the Apple II 
switch to begin the production of a Hybrid Emulation disk. Use an 
Emulation disk already configured for lower case, because we will use 
base page address $F3 for color text utilities. Read track 0 into memory 
at $4000. The Monitor command 4582:EA EA replaces the ORA #$40 
instruction with two NOP instructions. Restore the modified track 0 to 
the Emulation disk. If you boot an Apple II disk at this stage, the screen 
fills with a checkerboard of miscellaneous colors (or shades of gray). The 
Monitor doesn't work at all. We have to chase down some problems to 
build a working computer. 

The checkerboard screen display occurs because the Apple II 
Monitor INIT routine ($FB2F) sets the display switches for the Apple 
III color text mode. In this mode, each character in text page one ($400 
through $7FF) is affected by the contents of the corresponding address in 
text page two ($8(X) through $BFF). The most significant nibble deter- 
mines the character color, and the least significant nibble determines the 
background color. On a monochrome monitor, $F0 produces the 
normal light-on-dark display, and $0F yields an inverse display. On a 
color monitor, the colors are those listed on page 41 of the Standard De- 
vice Drivers Manual. 

The Monitor program doesn't work because it expects to find data 
tables in $FFEX) through $FFEF, where there are Apple III control 
registers. We will move the data tables into parts of the Monitor that 
can't be used in the Hybrid mode. Listing 3 illustrates subroutines that 
make the color text mode a usable addition to Applesoft programs, read 
the system clock, and control the 6502 clock and video output. All are 
shown on memory page three, but they could be installed permanently in 
portions of Applesoft and the Monitor used by the cassette load and save 
commands and the lo-res graphics commands. 

Initializing the color text mode requires filling text page two with $F0 
bytes to give a normal display. This usually destroys the first $400 bytes 
of an Applesoft program, so the initializing routine beginning at $300 re- 
locates the start of Basic programs to $000 and calls the Applesoft new 
program instruction. Because of this, the color-text initialization, call 
768, must be the last instruction in any Basic program in which it is used. 



To restore the screen to a normal di.splay without destroying Basic 
programs, call 787. The color-text routines use the base page address that 
we eliminated from the Applesoft flashing mode ($F3) to store the value 
used to fill text page two. Using C for the character color and B for the 
background, each with a range 0 to 15, VAL = B + I6*C. Then poke 
243, VAL : call 791 to color the screen and characters to your liking. To 
nil just one line poke 243, VAL: poke 64,line : call 807. This feature has 
real utility. If VAL = 0, the line disappears from view, but the charac- 
ters are still in screen memory. Set VAL = 240 and the characters reap- 
pear in normal display. For inverse, use VAL= 15. The EmulaUon pro- 
gram uses this technique to change menu fields from normal to inverse 
and to erase and restore lines of text. 

Only three of the Apple III display modes can be used easily with Ap- 
ple II software. Turn on full-screen, hi-res, black-and-white graphics with 
LDA $C057 or peek(49239). Return to text mode with LDA $C056 or 
peek(49238). The forty-column color-text switch is LDA $C051 or 
peek(49233). Return to normal text mode and normal use of the $800 
through $BFF address range with LDA $C050 or peek(49232). John 
Jeppson described the soft switches for all of the Apple I II display modes 
in the article mentioned earlier. 

Here are the steps needed to complete the Hybrid Emulation disk af- 
ter track 0 has been modified as described: 

1. Using Trackmover and an Emulafion disk already configured for 
lower case, load track 5 at $5000 and tracks 8 and 9 at $6000. 

2. Use the Monitor to install the subroutine table in its new lo- 
cation with 59CE < FFE3.FFFFM and 74CE < FFE3.FFFFM. 
Move the character table with 5319 < FFCC.FFE2M and6E19< 
FFCC.FFE2M. 

3. References to the Monitor data tables will be corrected with the 
following entries:

Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the Hybrid mode is the use of 
the 2-MHz processor speed with Applesoft programs. The 6502 clock 
can be set to 2 MHz for numerical processing but should be returned to 1 
MHz for 1/0 operations. Since there is no SOS in this mode, you have 
the responsibility of taking care of it. Using the utilities shown in listing 
3, call 842 to set the clock to 2 MHz and call 851 to return to 1 MHz. For 
even faster computations, you can turn off the video screen with call 860 
and turn it back on with call 869. 

As an example of the gains possible with this novel variation of Emu- 
lation, let's compare the performance of Applesoft at 2 MHz with that of 
the Basics tested on Jerry Pournelle's 20-by-20 matrix multiplication 
benchmark program described in the October 1982 issue of Byte maga- 
zine ("User's Column"). Table 2 shows the results obtained with several 
versions of Basic.

Applesoft, 2 MHz, video on 2:10 

Applesoft, 2 MHz, video off 1:41 
Table 2. Execution times for [he 20-by-20 matrix 

multiplication benchmark program. 

The results in the normal operating modes were surprising, because 
Business Basic is usually a little faster than Applesoft in numerical bench- 
marks. Business Basic has a definite advantage if there is much I/O. The 
Applesoft advantage at 2 MHz was expected, because it has none of the 
software overhead needed to manage the full Apple III memory. 

Ail of the benchmark programs used the Apple III system clock as a 
stopwatch. Listing 3 includes a clock routine that can be used with 
Applesoft programs in the Hybrid mode. It reads all eight clock bytes 
into a buffer and then prints the hour, minute, and second on-saeen with- 
out a carriage return. Each byte is encoded as two BCD nibbles, so the 
printed hex value appears to be the correct decimal number. For other 
uses, the BCD should be decoded to binary or ASCII. 

The Hybrid mode provides full access to all of the Apple III hard- 
ware features, including memory bank switching, extended indirect ad- 
dressing, and read/write RAM in SCOOO through SFFFF, including the 
area normally used for I/O. SOS was designed to free the user from 
memory management details, but an imaginative hobbyist could create 
a 192K RAM-based pseudodisk for the Emulation Apple. 

The extensions of the Emulation mode discussed in these three 
articles arose from a variety of intended applications. A solution to the 
games problem was required to please the younger members of the 
author's family when the Apple III replaced an Apple II. Lower-case 
character display and entry were needed for compatibility with Apple II 
software already on hand. The development of the Hybrid mode was 
spurred by a data-taking application that demanded use of the clock, fast 
computations, and usable software in just a few days. Taken together, 
these projects emphasize that the Emulation mode offers much more 
than a partial imitation of the Apple II. For those who care to explore it, 
the Emulation program provides a route to the very heart of the 
Apple III.

□ Apple Computer (Cupertino, CA) and Gen- 
eral Electric Credit (Stamford, CT) have in- 
troduced a manufacturer-sponsored credit card 
for buyers of Apple computers and compatible 
hardware and software. The Apple card will al- 
low qualifying customers to charge up to 90 per- 
cent of a computer's purchase price and will 
serve as an alternative to other cards with lower 
credit limits. To qualify, a customer must pur- 
chase an Apple and finance a minimum of $825. 
After purchase of the computer, a customer can 
use the credit card to buy software and acces- 
sories, provided the purchases have a minimum 
value of $100. Credit card applications are 
available at participating authorized Apple 
dealers.

GA) has purchased Edu-Ware Services 

(Agoura, CA) for $1.5 million in MSA stock, 
plus a deferred cash percentage of future prof- 



its, announced Steven Pederson, Edu-Ware's 
president. "We're very, very happy about the 
acquisition because we like the people at MSA 
so much. Working with them will do a lot for us 
personally, professionally, and economically," 
Pederson said. Edu-Ware, which is now an 
MSA subsidiary, will be hiring many program- 
mers in a push to expand new product develop- 
ment but will not otherwise change its person- 
nel or operating structure. Future company 
plans may include a cooperative effort with 
MSA's Peachtree Software division, as well as a 
more competitive marketing approach. "Essen- 
tially we now have the backing of the world's 
largest independent software manufacturer. We 
are going to play to win in the educational mar- 
ket," Pederson said.

derland, executive vice president and chief op-

merly vice president of markeUng at United 
Vintners, has accepted the post of vice president

garding licensing of its other programs, Clardy 
said. Will Clardy, formerly Synergistic's mar- 
keting manager, is now sales manager at Sierra 
On-Line, and David Kampschafer, product 
service manager at Synergistic, has accepted a 
position with Human Engineered Software. Syn- 
ergistic will now concentrate on new software 
development and software conversions for 
other companies including Atari, according to 
Bob Clardy, Synergistic's president. "The pur- 
pose of the change was to free up our time and 
resources to concentrate on producing quality 
software," Clardy said. 

□ Information Unlimited Software (Sausali- 
to, CA), a publisher of business programs, has 
announced that it has been purchased by Com- 
puter Associates (Jericho, NY), a developer of 
mainframe and minicomputer software. For- 
mer lUS president Jim Baker has transferred to

□ Softsel Computer Products (Inglewood, 
CA) will present awards to publishers who have 
displayed excellence in personal computer soft- 
ware at a black-tie-optional ceremony during 
COMDEX/Fall, to be held in Las Vegas this 
November. The awards, based on Softsel's Hot 
List, will honor software publishers for out- 
standing achievements in sales, packaging, per- 
formance, and innovation, said Robert S. Leff, 
president of Softsel. Invitations to the affair will 
be sent to software publishers, the media, Soft- 
sel dealers, and other members of the software 
industry. "We felt that it was time for the soft-

ware publishers — a most vital force in the 
computer industry — to receive recognition for 
their creativity," Leff said. 

□ Leiand Strange, president of Intelligent 
Systems (Norcross, GA) and vice president of 
Quadram (Norcross, GA), has been named one 
of Georgia's five best entrepreneurs by the At- 
lanta Business Chronicle. According to Chroni- 
cle writer Jan Weiner, Strange was chosen as 
one of the year's top five because he was able to 
start his own company (Quadram), sell it, and 
then become president of the acquiring com- 
pany while retaining the vice presidency of his 
previous firm. 

□ The Software Store has moved. Its new ad- 
dress is 16582-Q Gothard Street, Huntington

unchanged. 

□ Reston Publishing (Reston, VA) has 
formed the Reston Computer Group to con- 
solidate all book and software lines developed 
and marketed by the company. In addition to 
its established computer book line, the group 
will publish four lines of software: Creative 
Pastimes, learning games and family activities 
for use on the Apple and other computers; two 
software lines for the IBM pc; and one for the 
Timex/Sinclair computer. Future Reston Com- 
puter Group releases will include Moviemaker, 
a computer animation program for the Apple. 

□ Startech Marketing (Woodland Hills, CA) 
has announced its birth as a national software 
distributor that will handle only Muse and Sir- 
tech products. Startech has appointed Patricia 
Teetor as vice president of sales and customer 
support services. 

□ Micro Lab has moved. Its new address is 
The Micro Lab Center, 2699 Skokie Valley 
Road, Highland Park, IL 60035. The phone 
number remains unchanged. 

□ ComputerLand (Hay ward, CA) has opened 
its first ComputerLand Learning Center in In- 
dianapolis. The company will provide each 
store in the projected chain of learning centers 
with course outlines and training packages for 
business, educational, and home use. All Com- 
puterLand stores will have access to the pack- 
aged training programs, but only specially des- 
ignated stores will become learning centers. 
"We feel that all the stores provide superior 
postsale training to customers, but central sup- 
port will help to standardize and strengthen 
training programs throughout the network," 
said Mike Shabazian, senior vice president of 
ComputerLand. 

□ Carolyn J. Kuhn, a former Control Data 
executive, has formed a firm that will serve as 
an agent between software developers and pub- 
lishers. According to Kuhn, Software Mart 
(Austin, TX) will match products to needs by 
helping programmers find appropriate publish- 
ers for their products and by helping publishers 
reduce the risk of "missing the market" be- 
cause they didn't have a program when the Ume 
was right. "The growing competition in the mi- 
crocomputer software business makes this 'up- 
front marketing' more critical than ever," Kuhn 
said. 

□ When looking for the end of the rainbow, it 
helps to know the address. Rainbow Comput-

SOFICfiRD 
Symposhim 

by Greg Tlbbetts 



Welcome to the September installment of SoftCard Symposium. This 
month we'll examine the BIOS disk I/O routines and, where necessary, 
contrast them with the equivalent routines in the more "standard" ver- 
sions of CP/M. 

Referring back for a moment to the BIOS jump vector table (shown 
on this page), we can see that eight of the seventeen entries in the table allow 
access to the disk driver portions of the BIOS. These disk I/O rou- 
tines vary from those that perform complex operations, such as the 
READ/WRITE routines, to very simple ones, such as SETTRK and 
SETSEC. Before examining the BIOS disk I/O routines, let's briefly con- 
sider what advice Digital Research offers the BIOS implementer. 

In its CP/M 2.0 Alteration Guide, Digital Research sjDecifies that 
"disk I/O is always performed through a sequence of calls on the var- 
ious access subroutines that set up the disk number to access, the track 
and sector on a particular disk, and the direct memory access (DMA) ad- 
dress involved in the I/O operation. After all these parameters have been 
set up, a call is made to the READ or WRITE function to perform the 
actual I/O operation." 

It's obvious from this statement that the primary actions accom- 
plished by means of disk drives are reads and writes and that all other 
routines merely support these activities. In practice, most support rou- 
tines in the various BIOS implementations do very little besides save in- 
formation about the track, sector, and DMA address supplied by BDOS. 
In these cases, the saved information is used later during the actual read 
or write call.

The efficiency of making five BIOS calls, three of which simply store 
information for later, is somewhat open to question, especially when you 
consider that BDOS has already done the work of storing the informa- 
tion somewhere within itself It might have been better if BDOS had been 
designed in such a way that for disk accesses it constructed a table con- 
taining the disk number, track, sector, DMA, type of operation, and so 
on, and then simply passed the location of this table to a single BIOS 
read/write routine. This idea is meant not as a hindsight criticism of 
CP/M's designers but rather simply to point out that Digital Research's 



mill 

method is not the only viable approach, nor even the most efficient. The 
point is rather moot, however, since the existing version of BDOS is de- 
signed to operate with many BIOS calls, and if compatibility is to be 
maintained, this design must be perpetuated. 

In our discussions so far, we have seen that CP/M's designers at- 
tempted to set it up in such a way that the B lOS would be totally under the 
control of BDOS, rather than being accessible in any way by the user's 
programs — never mind that this is not strictly followed in the real 
world. When we focused more specifically on character I/O, we further 
saw that the BDOS system calls accessed by user programs (also called 
BDOS functions) are generally comparable to the BIOS character I/O 
entry points. In other words, if we wished to output a character to the 
screen, for example, we could do so by calling BDOS function 2 (con- 
sole output) or by calling the fifth entry point in the BIOS jump table (JP 
CONOUT). The two would be more or less functionally equivalent; the 
primary difference between them is whether BDOS is able to keep track 
of the cursor position on-screen. 

This ability to access BIOS routines selectively and individually by 
making BDOS system calls is not available with BIOS disk subroutines. 
For example, there are no BDOS functions for setting the track number, 
setfing the sector number, and so on. With the exception of BDOS func- 
tions 14 (disk select) and 26 (set DMA address), all BDOS system calls 
relate to files rather than to the raw information (tracks and .sectors) the 
BIOS works with. This has made the creation of low-level disk utilities 
somewhat tricky, since the BIOS must be accessed directly for nearly 
everything. In normal operation and programming, however, BIOS is ig- 
nored and BDOS is allowed to control totally the calling and sequencing 
of the BIOS disk routines. As a result of that, and without the one-to-one 
comparability between BDOS disk functions and BIOS disk I/O entry 
points, the BIOS disk subroutines have become something of a "black 
box" for most users. The rest of this article is an attempt to dispel some 
of the mystery that surrounds these subroutines. 

BIOS function number: 10 Jump location: BIOS + 27 

Routine name: SELDSK Routine type: Disk 

Routine purpose: Select a specific disk drive 

Entry parameters: Disk to select in register [C] 

Exit parameters: DPH address in [HL] (O0 = error) 

According to Digital Research, SELDSK must select the drive whose 
number is provided in register [C] (A: = 0,B: = l...P:= 15) and return to 
BDOS (in the [HL] register pair) the address of the disk parameter 
header (DPH) for that drive. If there is no drive associated with the num- 
ber in register [C], SELDSK must return a zero in the register pair to in- 
form BDOS of that fact. The term select has a very loose meaning here; 
basically, it comes from the terminology used with disk controllers. 

Since there are few occasions when drives must be used simulta- 
neously, it is inefficient to duplicate the entire disk controller for each 
drive. For this reason, several drives are usually connected to the same 
controller (two drives with Apple's Disk II system, for example), and 
special "select" circuitry is provided to switch the controller between 
drives. The action taken by the software is to send the drive "select" sig- 
nal to the controller's "select circuitry" — hence the term drive select. 

SELDSK is the starting point of any new disk access by BDOS, and 



268 




from our discussion of the disk data structures these last months, it 
should be apparent why SELDSK is called first. Without the informa- 
tion contained in the DPH and the other data structures pointed to by 
the DPH, BDOS can know nothing about the drive and the format of 
the media in it. The lack of this knowledge prevents BDOS from being 
able to locate the disk's directory, much less calculate the location of file 
records. What BDOS needs most from SELDSK, then, is the DPH ad- 
dress. As soon as it has that address, BDOS can initialize its own in- 
ternal tables and structures as well as those in the BIOS, such as the ALV 
and CKS areas. 

Once these data locations and areas are initialized, BDOS can sim- 
ply keep updating them as it continues to access the drive. For this rea- 
son, following a call to SELDSK, any number of calls to the remaining 
BIOS disk routines may be made in order to read and write sectors of da- 
ta on whichever specific disk was selected. Only when a new disk must be 
accessed will BDOS again call SELDSK. BDOS will then read or write 
any number of sectors to that disk, and so on. Although it will call 
SELDSK each time a disk other than the current one is accessed, BDOS 
will not reinitialize the data structures each time. Only when it has been 
notified of a media change in the drive, either by a warm boot from the 
user or by an altered directory checksum value during its disk access, will 
BDOS re-create the data structures. BDOS keeps an internal table of 
which disks have been accessed (which have had their data structures ini- 
tialized) and which have not. 

The other functions that SELDSK performs (such as hardware ini- 
tialization) are relatively unimportant to BDOS so long as any that must 
be done are performed sometime prior to the read or write. In most 
BIOS implementations, in addition to passing the DPH address to 
BDOS, SELDSK sets up floppy drives for action, performing the select 
function just mentioned, testing whether the drive is ready (plugged in, 
turned on, and so forth), and determining density of the disk format in 
use in mukidensity environments. SELDSK's duties with hard drives, 
which need no density tests, are usually much simpler. 

In the SoftCard BIOS, SELDSK performs no actual hardware con- 
trol or drive select function; rather that action is delayed until the actual 



TALK SEPTEMBER 1983" 

read or write. The reason for this is that, depending on what operation 
BDOS is currently performing (or on some particular whim of the user's 
program), BDOS may call SELDSK to select a drive without actually 
going on to access that drive for a read or write. In such a case there is 
little to be gained from turning the drive motor on, especially since do- 
ing so would cause most controllers to turn the motors off automatically 
on any other drives serviced by them. Switching back and forth to no 
good purpose would cause severe slowdowns in disk access response. 
With eight-inch drives, which may load the heads when selected, doing 
this would cause unnecessary wear on moving parts and disk surfaces; 
and in the Apple, there's the potential for minor but undue strain on the 
power supply and drives. SoftCard's SELDSK, therefore, does little be- 
sides return the DPH address to BDOS. 

Located at 0DD6DH in 56K, SELDSK first checks the number in 
register [C] against the number of active drives found in the system dur- 
ing the boot sequence. As you'll remember from our discussion of the 
BOOT routine, the disk controller cards are counted and multiplied by 
two to get the maximum number of drives possible in the system, and the 
value that results is placed in a variable called NDISKS. It is this value 
minus one that is checked against the disk number BDOS is trying to se- 
lect. A number that is not in the range of 0 to NDISKS -1 causes a 
branch to SELERR at 0DD84H. SELERR loads 00 in the [HL] pair 
and returns to BDOS. A valid disk number, on the other hand, causes 
SELDSK to load the base address of the DPH tables into [HL] and 
jump to a routine called AX 16 at 0DD64H. This routine multiplies the 
disk number (0-15) by sixteen (the number of bytes in a DPH). The re- 
sult of this calculation is added to [HL], leaving [HL] containing the ad- 
dress of that drive's DPH. Control returns directly to BDOS from the 
AX 16 subroutine. 

That's not all SELDSK does, however. If it were, there would be no 
way for READ or WRITE to know that a new disk had been selected, 
and so the next call to either of them would access the old disk. There- 
fore, after checking for the validity of the disk being selected and before 
obtaining the DPH address, SELDSK handles this potential problem by 
taking the number of the disk to be selected from register [C] and put- 
ting it into a variable called SEKDSK, located at ODEADH in 56K. 
SEKDSK is the variable that READ and WRITE will access later to do 
the actual hardware control that switching to this drive requires. 

In addition to setting up the SEKDSK variable, SoftCard's 
SELDSK routine does something else. While this process is not men- 
tioned in the Digital Research documentation or included in the compa- 
ny's sample BIOS (nor in most other implementations we're familiar 
with), it does have a useful purpose. 

When a nonexistent drive is selected in a certain way, standard 
CP/M systems will hang. This usually happens when an attempt is made 
to log on to such a drive from the keyboard (for example, by typing C: at 
the A > prompt when there is no drive C:). A person who makes this 
mistake gets the message "BDOS error on C:SELECT." Typing a con- 
trol-C at this point causes a warm boot and activates drive A: to reload 
the CCP; and then, since drive C; was selected by the user before, the 
CCP once again attempts to log it in. And so on, and so on. Only a com- 
plete reboot will get CP/M going again. The reason all this occurs is that 
the system keeps track of the currently selected disk in a variable called 
CDISK, found at 0004H in the system data page. When the CCP is told 
to log in a new drive, CDISK is altered to this new value even before 
SELDSK is called to find out if the drive is valid! 

As we saw from our discussion some months ago, the last action of 
the warm boot code is to jump to the beginning of the CCP with the cur- 
rently logged disk value in register [C]. Where does it get this value? You 
guessed it, from CDISK. Consequently, when attempting to log in non- 
existent drive C;, CDISK is immediately changed to 02H and then 
SELDSK is called. When the disk select fails, SELDSK reports this back 
to BDOS, which prints the error message and awaits a keystroke before 
requesting a warm boot. When the keystroke is typed, the warm boot is 
performed, a 02H is loaded into register [C], and control is passed to 
the CCP, which immediately tries to log in drive C: (02H). In the Soft- 
Card SELDSK, however, this does not happen. 

When SELDSK is called, its first activity is the check for the validity 
of the disk selected. If the new disk is found to be valid, SELDSK loads 
the value from CDISK (which is now known to be a valid disk). It saves

this value in a variable called OLDISK, located at ODEACH. Each suc- 
cessful select, then, saves the value of the new valid disk in OLDISK. 
Following this, if an attempted select on a nonvalid drive is made, the 
SELERR routine loads the value from OLDISK and writes it into the 
CDISK location before returning to BDOS with the error. When BDOS 
requests the warm boot, then, the value passed by the warm boot code to 
the CCP is not that of the nonvalid disk, but rather that of the last valid 
one. This extra code has no effect on any errors other than SELECT er- 
rors. Attempting to log in a drive with no disk, or a drive where there is a 
controller but no drive (that is, drive D: in a three-drive system), pro- 
duces a "bad sector" error message and the system still hangs.

HOME Routine type: Disk 
Seek track 00 on selected disk 
None 
None 



The HOME routine is provided more as an aid to BIOS designers 
, than anything else. It is functionally equivalent to calling SETTRK with 
a parameter of 00. The HOME routine was provided separately, how- 
I ever, because with certain disk controllers it was easier to move the disk's 
read/write head to track 00 than it was to find a specific track. The 
J HOME routine always seeks track 00, and making it a separate routine 
; speeds things up slightly. HOME is called after each successful disk se- 
! lect to place the read/write head in a known position for BDOS, which 
1 keeps track of it. With more modern disk controllers that are capable of 
seeking from any track to any track with a single command, most BIOS 
designers simply let HOME load the [BC] register pair with 00 and jump 
i or "fall through" to the SETTRK routine. 

Another factor to take into account in constructing a HOME rou- 
tine is whether the BIOS is performing blocking and deblocking of large 
i sectors. As we've discussed (and will cover in more detail later), BIOS 
; block/deblock often defers the writing of 256-byte disk sectors until it is 
sure that the other half (the second 128-byte CP/M sector) will not be 



modified. It is common, therefore, for the BIOS to get a read or write re- 
quest while it still has valid unwritten data in its buffer from the last 
write request. This data must be written before the requested operation 
can be performed. Had BDOS issued a HOME command in between 
operations, and had HOME actually moved the read/write head to track 
00, the BIOS would have to move it back where it was, do the leftover 
write, and then home it again. This would result in considerable loss of 
efficiency. Allowing HOME to defer the actual .seek until the 
READ/WRITE routines avoids this potential problem. 

SoftCard's HOME roufine, located at 0DD4BH, in fact performs as 
we have described. Since the Apple Disk II drives have only thirty-five 
tracks, only the [C] register of the [BC] pair is used and all track storage 
locations are single-byte variables. In addition to falling through 
SETTRK with a 0 parameter, HOME also clears the Hag indicating that 
the block/deblock buffer is active (if there is no sign that there is an un- 
written sector contained in the buffer). Both of these last duties involve 
the block/deblock algorithm itself, which we'll save until we discuss 
READ and WRITE.

Although SETTRK's purpose is to move the read/write head of the 
disk to the track specified in [BC] (SoftCard uses just [C], remember), 
this acfion is usually deferred until just before the actual read or write is 
performed; the reasons for this are the same as the ones we spoke of 
when discussing the HOME routine. In the SoftCard BIOS, SETTRK is 
located at 0DD56H, immediately following HOME. It loads the value of 
the track to seek from register [C] to register [A] and then loads that 
value into a variable called SEKTRK (at 0DEA8H); it then returns to 
BDOS. It is this variable that READ and WRITE will access for the 
current track to seek when they are called.

Routine name: SECTRAN Routine type: Disk 
Routine purpose: Map logical to physical sector numbers 
Entry parameters: Logical sector number to map in [BC] 
XLT table address in [DE] 
Exit parameters: Physical sector number in [HL] 

As we've mentioned in the past, the SECTRAN routine is responsi- 
ble for handling software interleave translation. Its main purpose is to allow 
the BIOS designer the utmost flexibility in coming up with his own meth- 
od of interleaving. BDOS calculates sector numbers based on there be- 
ing no interleave (that is, sectors are numbered 0, 1 ,2,3,4 ... 15), and sim- 
ply asks the BIOS for the necessary translation. In the SoftCard 
BIOS, interleaving is a two-part affair. The first takes place in the 
READ/WRITE routines, where the translation from a three-sector in- 
terleave to a two-sector one is accomplished, and the second occurs 
in the RWTS routines where the two-sector interleave is translated. Giv- 
en this arrangement, there is no need to do anything outside of 
READ/WRITE. For this reason, the entry for SECTRAN in the BIOS 
jump table is not actually a jump, but rather two load instructions and a 
RET as shown below: 

LD H,B 

LD L,C 

RET 

This entry occupies the same three bytes as a jump instruction and its 
address but has the effect of returning in [HL] exactly what was supplied 
in [BC] without having taken up space for a routine to perform this func- 
tion. Even though there are zeros in the XLT field of the DPH for a par- 
ticular drive, BDOS still calls SECTRAN in order to give BIOS design- 
ers an opportunity to implement any necessary translation functions of 
their own. 



The SETSEC routine, like SETTRK, is simply used by BDOS to 
pass the sector number to the BIOS. The SoftCard BIOS again uses only 
the [C] register, since there are only thirty-two CP/M sectors per track. 
SETSEC (again like SETTRK) defers the actual passing of the sector 
number to the controller (RWTS in this case) when called. Instead, the 
value in register [C] is placed in a variable called CPMSEC, located at 
0DEA9H. Control is then passed immediately back to BDOS. In the 
SoftCard BIOS, SETSEC is located at 0DD89H, immediately following 
SELDSK.

SETSEC Routine type: Disk 

Seek a specific sector on selected disk 
Sector number to seek in [BC] 
None 



SETDMA's only purpose is to inform the BIOS of the 128-byte area 
that BDOS wishes the next disk sector(s) read from or written to. The 
BIOS must not assume that a call to SETDMA will occur before each 
read or write, since there are occasions when several sectors may be 
loaded into the same space and processed one at a dme. The inifial de- 
fault DMA address is 0080H in the last half of the system data page. 
Most data transfers are performed from and to here, although, as we've 
seen, BDOS will use other DMA addresses as necessary. 

In the SoftCard BIOS, SETDMA is located immediately after 
SETSEC at ODDS EH. When called, it loads the contents of [BC] into a 
variable called DMAADR at 0DEB8H and returns to BDOS. During 
reads and writes, the READ/WRITE routines use the contents of this 
variable as the start address needed for moving 128-byte records to and 
from the deblocking buffer. 

We have now finished the easy ones. The only two routines left are 
READ and WRITE, which take up most of the space in the BIOS disk 
access routines. We'll devote the next column and possibly the one after 
that to discussing them. As you can see from what we've discussed so far, 
in a blocking/ deblocking BIOS like the SoftCard, READ and WRITE 
do most of the work. Until next month. ... JM

Buttonwood 
Apples 




BV m LAIlDlSPWi 1 1 i n I i I 



I In the time since Buttonwood Apples began two years ago this 
I month, we've considered numerous investment programs that run on the 
I Apple — and times have changed. Two years ago, most people who used 
the Apple for investing were techies, folks who willfully lost sleep to fig- 
ure out just how these beige boxes worked. Sprinkled among us were in- 
vestment professionals who recognized early on what a difference hav- 
ing a personal computer could make in investing. 

Some of the men and women who used their Apples in investing two 
years ago are today's software authors and publishers. Others got rich in 
the market, and still others got poor. But the fascination that was so ad- 
dicting then still holds us now: the ability to direct and use the power of 
the Apple to help us make money. Nothing holds an investor's attention 
like the prospect of a big long-term capital gain. 

Many of today's Apple users are neither techies nor market profes- 
sionals. They're people who bought a computer because they knew it 
would change the way they live and work, parents who want to prepare 
their children for the future, computer hobbyists, and, of course, com- 
puter game connoisseurs. Perhaps you fit one of these descriptions. If so, 
it may be that the only reason you don't use your Apple as an aid in your 
investment decisions is that you don't know how to. This is not to say 
that you couldn't go to your local computer store and buy any invest- 
ment program you wanted. Rather, the stumbling block is that you don't 
understand the basics of investing — the difference between a common 
stock and a preferred stock, why buying a security on margin is tricky 
(and what is margin anyway?). If you understand the basics, you just 
might put a little money at risk in the market. Maybe you'd make some 
money, maybe you'd lose some. The point is — you'll never know unless 
you give it a shot. 

In this month's column, we'll look at why you might want to use an 
Apple to help you invest in the first place. Starting next time. Button- 
wood Apples is going to be a two-part column. The first half of it will be 
a tutorial on investing — the basics you need in order to get started. The 
second half will be what you're used to — reviews of major pieces of in- 
vestment software. The premise is simple: If you want to invest but don't 
know how, part one of this column will help you learn; and if you al- 
ready know what to do, look to part two for programs you should 
consider. 

The hope is that you'll find the information contained here useful 
and profitable. To help improve the odds that it will be both, write in 
with your questions, whether they concern particular pieces of software 
or investing in general. If we can't answer a question, we'll try to find 
someone who can. 

Why should you even consider using an Apple to help you analyze 
investments? Because doing so can save you a great deal of time and 
money, that's why. 

Investing, like medicine, is considered an art. It appears to be a mix- 
ture of exact science, emotion, luck, and folklore. Different investors sub- 
scribe to different theories. 

The two major schools of thought are technical analysis and funda- 
mental analysis. Technical analysis concentrates on the history of a se- 



curity — how it has performed over time. The key indicators here are the 
security's price and volume. Technicians look for trends. It doesn't mat- 
ter if a trend is up or down — as long as you can identify that trend, you 
can make money. 

Fundamental analysis concentrates on how a company is doing. 
How are its earnings? What are its future prospects? What price is its 
stock trading at? If the organization itself is doing well, the theory goes, 
its stock will too. 

These two major schools of analysis can be used to evaluate any type 
of security; they are used primarily, however, with equity-based invest- 
ments such as stocks, options, and warrants. Bonds are a little different. 
The price of a bond is determined by the going market interest rate, the 
coupon (or face interest rate) of the bond, any special conditions placed 
on the bond (indentures), and the ability of the borrower (the issuer) to 
pay the principal (the money borrowed) and the interest on the bond.

Software designed to run on the Apple has been written to perform 
both technical analysis and fundamental analysis. Why? Let's consider 
technical analysis first. 

The heart of technical analysis is charting numbers. These numbers 
might be the actual price or volume statistics of a given security, or they 
might be a charting of the results of a calculation designed to identify 
trends (or, as many technicians call them, opportunities). 

What does it take to do a technical analysis chart? Well, it takes a 
pencil, paper, a bunch of raw data, a file cabinet, a calculator, a huge 
worksheet, a lot of patience, and a great deal of time. If we put the power 1 
of the Apple to work, we can direct it to collect our data, store it, manip- 
ulate it, crunch it, and then chart it. It can do all this in about one-hun- 
dredth of the time it would take to do it manually, with what ap- 
proaches 100 percent accuracy. In other words, enlisting the Apple's aid 
allows us to do one hundred times the analysis we could do by hand. 
This improves our chances — our odds, if you will — of making a profit- 
able investment decision. 

Now let's consider fundamental analysis. To look at the entire uni- 
verse of investments available to us would be almost impossible. There 
are thousands of stocks listed on the New York and American stock ex- 
changes alone. Add to that the stocks traded over the counter and those 
on the regional exchanges and the task of covering them all becomes 
even greater. Yet if we don't want to limit our potential profit oppor- 
tunities, we'll need to analyze every stock on every exchange. 

Instead, why not let the Apple do the work for us? Using a funda- 
mental analysis package, such as the Dow Jones Market Microscope, 
would enable us to get and analyze the financial statistics on almost any 
company and then print out a report showing which stocks warranted 
further evaluation. We're not replacing ourselves with the Apple in the 
investment process; we're simply using it to augment our own abilities. 

That's a key point. In any form of Apple-assisted investment activ- 
ity, we shouldn't be replacing our own judgment with the computer's. 
Rather, we should use the Apple as an assistant, adding its incredible 
computational power to our incredible (we hope) analytical or decision- 
making ability. There's a tradeofT, though. Using the Apple in invest- 
ment analysis can get expensive. It may be that the cost of software, 
hardware, and connect charges for your database exceeds the value you 
place on your own time or your ability to recoup the money you've spent 
on equipment. Should I or shouldn't I use my Apple in investing is a 
question only you can answer. 

If you do decide to use your Apple in investing, how do you shop for 
investment packages? Sad to say, your average computer store salesper- 
son knows as much about investing as he does about the mating habits of 
the African fruit fiy. When you ask to see an investment program, you'll 
probably hear something like, "We don't stock them but we can order 
them. Which one do you want?" Would you buy a car that way? Of 
course not. Then don't purchase a piece of software in that manner 
either. 

Unfortunately, you can't ask your local computer dealer to order 
every piece of software you're considering so that you can evaluate it, 
keep it if it's good, and return it if it's not. So what can you do? 

Well, to begin with, you can gather information by reading reviews, 
write-ups, and advertisements in various computer publications. Doing 
this will begin to give you a feel for what's out there. In addition, user 
groups often have SIGs (special interest groups) in investing. These 
groups consist of individuals like you who want to learn more about us- 
ing the computer as an investment tool. Some of them may be quite ex- 
perienced, others may be novices. In any event, the purpose of a SIG is to 
help its members learn. Through an investment SIG, you'll meet people 
who use investment software, and you'll have the opportunity to get their 
opinions about the worth of particular programs. 

Some SIGs establish a special-purchase fund for buying new pieces of 
investment software. All members of the SIG chip in to buy a new, in- 
teresting package; then someone is assigned to review it. Once the pack- 
age has been reviewed, each member uses the package for a while. If it's 
decided that the package is worth buying, one member buys the existing 
package from the group, and the other members purchase copies for 
themselves. If a package is worthless, each member is out only a fraction

of what it would have cost to buy the software on his or her own. (If you 
want to find out quickly which programs to avoid, all you have to do is 
find out which programs a good SIG still has on the shelf.) 

Another option is the new rental software stores and services that are 
popping up. They allow you to rent the package you're interested in and 
try it for a while. If you like it, you can buy it; if you don't, you can re- 
turn it. 

So now that you've found the package you want, where do you go to 
buy it? You could go back to your local retailer, order by mail from a 
discount house, or order direct from the publisher. Which is best? 

Remember the African fruit fly? If your local retailer knows nothing 
about the package you're interested in, why should you buy it from him? 
There are a couple of good reasons. The first is that if you buy the pack- 
age locally you'll have some leverage if it doesn't work properly. After 
all, a dealer who refuses to accept your return of unsatisfactory or defec- 
tive merchandise knows that he'll probably lose you as a future custom- 
er. Should you pay the full list price for the package? That's up to you, of 
course, but you might be surprised how flexible some retailers are on 
software prices. Everybody is in business to make a profit, of course, and 
you shouldn't begrudge your local computer store that opportunity, but 
exactly what that profit ought to be is not cast in stone. 

Buying a piece of software via mail order may save you some money, 
but you don't get the kind of leverage you'd have if you'd made the pur- 
chase locally. If you do go the mail-order route, be sure to use your cred- 
it card to pay for the purchase. As you may already know, if something 
you buy costs more than fifty dollars and the vendor is more than fifty 
miles from your home, you can complain to the credit card company if 
there's any problem. By the way, this works. If the company agrees with 
you and thinks there's been an injustice, you'll get your money back. 

The final alternative is to buy the package directly from the publish- 
er. In most cases, this isn't necessary and you're better off going through 
your local retailer in order to have that leverage we spoke of earlier. The 



publisher is going to give you the same amount of support whether you 
bought the package direct or through a retail outlet, so that's not an 
issue. 

By the way, if a retailer tells you that "we support this package," 
don't take the remark too seriously. Normally, all this means is that the 
store will call the publisher and ask questions for you, something you'd 
be better off doing yourself. Frankly, unless your retailers are registered 
investment advisers with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
they can't really support investment software. Why not? Well, selling 
training services on how to use a piece of software that employs a par- 
ticular investment technique is, in effect, endorsing that technique and 
giving investment advice. 

The bottom line on support is, when you buy your package, it's you, 
your telephone, and the publisher. If you're lucky enough to find some- 
one locally who knows that package, be it a retailer or another investor, 
you're that much ahead of the game. 

What about the Hardware You Need To Run the Software? The 
best advice anyone can give you on this score is, "Don't go hog wild!" If 
you're looking at a piece of software that requires you to buy an addi- 
tional $1,000 worth of hardware, make absolutely sure that the software 
is what you want. As anyone who invests knows, the goal of investing is 
to minimize risk while maximizing rewards. The same principle applies 
here, but for some reason some people still go out and spend a lot of 
money on hardware only to find out they never needed it in the first place 
(buying a letter-quality printer to produce charts when the charts can al- 
ready be seen on-screen or printed on a dot-matrix printer is an example 
of this). Sometimes people just find out, after having bought a lot of 
hardware, that the software itself doesn't do what they want. The best 
strategy is to be as cautious with your purchases as you are with the 
money you invest.

Part 3: Strings 



Unlike Basic, assembly language doesn't understand strings — an as- 
sembly language command can operate on only one character at a time. 

Does that mean that assembly language can't deal with strings? Of 
course not — assembly language can deal with almost anything! But the 
"understanding" — that is, the step-by-step instructions — must be pro- 
vided by the programmer. Your program has to tell the system, "This 
string begins here, and ends here." 

There are several ways to do this. Last month, for example, we did it 
by counting, and we got a program that would print a string. This 
month, we'll do it a different way, and we'll get a program that can print 
any one of several strings. 

Address and Length. Here are two ways to print a string, one in Ba- 
sic and one in assembly language. 



Basic 



Assembly Language 



10 


X = 0 


LDX 


#0 


20 


READ A$ 


LOOP LDA 


STRING, X 


30 


PRINT A$; 


JSR 


GOUT 


40 


X = X + 1 


INX 




50 


IF X<1 1 


GPX 


#11 




THEN 20 


BCC 


LOOP 


60 


DATA H,E,L,L,0, 


STRING ASC 


"HELLO BOSS!' 




"",B,0,S,S,! 







Note that the logical structure is the same in both listings, line by 
line — even though the symbols are different, and sometimes different 
techniques are used. For example, line 10 in the Basic version means, 
"Let the variable called X equal zero," while the assembly language ver- 
sion means "Load the register called X with zero"; but they both amount 
to the same thing, which is "set the loop counter to zero." 

Similarly, line 20 of each version means "Get the next character of 
the string," and line 30 means "Output that character." The techniques 
used in the two versions are different, but the result is the same. 

Line 40 is the actual counting instruction. INX, in the assembly lan- 
guage listing, is short for increment X. 

Line 50 is in two parts: first the loop exit test, "Have we done enough 
yet?" then the branch instruction, "If not, go back and do it again." BCC 
means branch if carry is clear. It's a way of testing the result of the com- 
pare X operation, CPX. When the number of passes through the loop, as 
counted by the X register (or by variable X), matches the number of 
characters in the string, the loop ends. The complete string has been 
printed, one character on each pass. 

In this case, the string was identified by two numbers: its starting ad- 
dress in memory (represented by the label STRING in the listing) and its 
length, or number of characters. Thus the program loads the first char- 
acter from the specified address and outputs it, then adds 1 to the ad- 
dress and repeats the process, and continues repeating until the counter 
equals the length of the string. 



This is a useful way to identify strings; in fact, this is how Applesoft 
usually does it internally; but the method has one slight disadvantage: It 
requires two numbers, address and length. There is another way to iden- 
tify a string, using only one number: the starting address. Instead of a 
length, you use a terminating character. 

From Here to CR. That means, of course, that you have to commit 
that character to that one use and no other: If you tell it to do so, the pro- 
gram will always interpret that character as the end of a string, whenever 
it finds it. But that's no loss to us; we can use the carriage return charac- 
ter, ASCII 13. We're already used to using that as an end-of-statement 
mark in Basic. 

Here is the assembly language program, rewritten to work with a 
terminating character instead of a length specification: 



1 
2 
3 
4 

5 
6 
7 
8

10 



LOOP 



EXIT 
STRING 



LDX #0 

LDASTRING.X 
CMP #13 
BEO EXIT 
JSR GOUT 
INX 

JMP LOOP 
RTS 

ASG "HELLO BOSS! 
DFB 13 



There are several changes. First, the exit test (lines 3 and 4 in this ver- 
sion) has been moved up ahead of the output step (JSR COUT, line 5). 
This enables us to test the character in the accumulator before the COUT 
routine scrambles it. It also means that the terminating character itself 
will not be printed — if that character is found, the routine exits before 
printing it — so that the terminator will not appear as part of your string. 

Note that the compare operation has been changed from CPX (com- 
pare X register) to CIVIP (compare accumulator). That's because the ear- 
lier version was testing for a character count — actually, a count of passes 
through the loop — and that value is found in the X register; this version 
is looking for a particular character, which will be found in the 
accumulator. 

And finally, the exit arrangement is different. The first version used 
the branch part of the test and branch operation — CPX #11, BCC 
LOOP — to close the loop (that is, to repeat the cycle if needed). We can't 
do that here because we're doing the test-and-branch before the output 
step: We can't close the loop with that branch, because there's still some- 
thing to do — JSR COUT — before we go around again. Instead, we use a 
jump command — similar to the goto command in Basic — to close 
the loop. 

When the complete string has been output, line 3 will find the termi- 
nating character; line 4 will then branch to the exit line (BEQ is short for 
branch if equal); and line 8, the exit line, will return to the calling pro- 
gram (RTS is the assembly language form of the Basic return command). 

Last but not least, line 10 provides the terminating character itself — 
DFB is short for define a byte, and means that the following byte (or

Get a Grip on 
McKhine Language. 

The Visible 
Computer: 6502 

The transition from Basic to machine language is a 
big step. Sometimes too big. 

Now there's a way to cut the problem down to size. 

The Visible Computer: 6502 is an integrated sys- 
tem for learning machine language programming. 
It features an animated simulation of the 6502 
microprocessor that lets you see with your own 
eyes what machine language is all about. You'll see 
how instructions are executed, not just the result. 
There's a hand-holding mode that traps the kind of 
mistakes beginning machine language program- 
mers are apt to make. And an expert mode, with 
more than twenty commands and functions that 
make it a powerful debugger for your machine 
language programs. 

The 140 page manual is a hard-working tutorial 
on the fundamental concepts of machine language. 
Youll learn "hands-on-keyboard" as you work your 
way through thirty progressively more complex 
demonstration programs stored on disk. 

The Visible Computer: 6502 is available for the 
Apple II Plus (or lie) for $49.95. If your dealer 
doesn't have it, you can order directly from Soft- 
ware Masters, 3330 Hillcroft #BB, Houston, Texas 
77057, or call (713) 266-5771. Please include $3.00

bytes) should be inserted into the program code. Warning: When you use 
this technique, be sure you remember to put in the terminating charac- 
ter. Thinlc about what will happen if you leave it out. . . . 

Many Messages. "But what is the use," you may be wondering, "of 
all these changes? The program is now several bytes longer than before, 
and it still does the same thing." Ah, but it doesn't do quite the same 
thing: Now it can find the end of a string, all by itself! Before, it had to be 
told where the end was (address and length, remember) — now, you only 
have to tell it where the string begins. 

What good is that? Why, this: If we simply poke a different address 
for the beginning of the string — change the value of STRING in line 2 — 
we can have the program output a different string on each call! Thus the 
program could be used to handle a whole set of strings: error messages, 
perhaps, or a help file. All you have to do is poke the address of the de- 
sired message before each call. 

In fact, there's an even easier way to do it. We can add a short sec- 
tion, called a "header," in front of the main program. This section modi- 
fies the message starting address and then jumps to the main program. 
We will need a separate header for each string, but the extra convenience 
will be worth it. It works like this: In order to output a particular string, 
your Basic program must call the header for that string (use the call com- 
mand and the starting address of the header you want). The header will 
load the correct number and then jump to the main routine, which will 
output the selected string. 

In effect, this gives the routine several different entry points: By se- 
lecting the proper entry point, you can choose which string will be 
printed. 

Offsets. We have been talking about changing the message starting 
address as a way of selecting a string. That would work, of course, but it 
turns out that there's another way. less obvious but actually simpler. 
Take another look at what the X register is doing. . . . 

In line 2 of the assembly language listing, we have the command, 
LDA STRING,X, an example of indexed addressing. STRING is a la- 
bel, a name that represents a particular address in memory. Each time 
the processor comes to this step, it does two processes: It adds the cur- 
rent value of the X register to the address STRING, giving a new ad- 
dress; then it reads the value stored at that new address and puts that 
value into the accumulator. 

In other words, the Apple interprets STRING,X as STRING + X. 
For this reason, the value of the X register is sometimes called an offset 
since it offsets the STRING address by a specified amount. 

As you may remember from algebra, there are two ways to change 
the value of A-l-B: You can change the value of A, or you can change the 
value of B. So if we want to change the value of STRING,X we can ei- 
ther change STRING, as previously mentioned, or we can change X by 
the same amount. The effect on STRING,X will be the same. 

Here's an example. Suppose we had stored three messages, "one," 
"two," and "three," in memory, starting at address 800 (decimal). The 
section of memory from 800 on would look like this: 

ONE CR TWO CR THREE CR... 

t t t 

800 804 808 

CR, of course, stands for the terminating carriage return character. 
The numbers underneath are the memory addresses of the starting byte 
of each string. 

The beginning of the first message is at STRING,X if STRING=800 
and X = 0. That's obvious enough. To get to the second message, we 
could use STRING = 804 and X=Oor we could use STRING = 800 and 
X=4. In the same way, the third message begins at STRING.X if 
STRING = 808 and X=0 or if STRING=800 and X =8. Thus we have a 
choice: We can select a particular string by using the same value of X 
and different values of STRING or by keeping STRING constant and 
changing X. 

Changing X turns out to be easier — it gives us a header for each 
string that is only five bytes long (if we had to change STRING instead, 
the header would take eight bytes — a problem we'll consider later). Thus 
we'll keep STRING constant at 800 and select different strings by chang- 
ing X: X=0 gives us the beginning of the string "one," X=4 gives us

New 15 day free trial offer on 

The Pizza Program 

Novy you can try it for 15 days before you pay — at no risk! 



A GREAT TIME SAVER 

The Pizza Program is a great 
time saver for ariyone who cooks 
or shops at the grocery store. To 
prove It we'll send you The Pizza 
Program to test for 15 days. And 
we won't send you a bill until 
after you've had at least 15 days 
to use It This will give you plenty 
of time to get it, look it over, try 
it out. 

ENDS HO-HUM DINNERS 

Are you tired of the same old 
thing for dinner? Would you like 
more variety in your evening 
meal? Is there something you'd 
rather have but don't get very 
often? The Pizza Program is de- 
signed just for you. It's a delight- 
ful new software package cre- 
ated to end the dinner-blahs with 
computer generated menus 
Here is how it works. 

You review what you like from 
the pre-selected food groups in 
the data base. You can easily 
delete any foods you don't enjoy 
or add anything new at any time. 
Then decide how often you like 
to eat certain items. For example. 
Don't like liver? Then eliminate it 
with a few simple keystrokes. Or, 
you can plan for it as often as 
every day or as seldom as once 
every 99 weeks. 

Want to go out more often to 
your favorite restaurants'' Enter 
the restaurant's name as a "Main 
Course." Now your computer will 
automatically remind you to go 
out to eat— and where— as often 
as you select. It can delete all 
other items from that meal ex- 
cept the name of the restaurant. 

AUTOMATIC SHOPPING LIST 

You get a new menu for a day, 
a week or any period of time you 
select up to 42 days at a time. It 
generates a detailed shopping 
list, automatically. And you can 
print out either menus or shop- 
ping lists anytime you want It 
can even arrange each item on 
the shopping list in sequence 
according to the aisles at your 
favorite store. Studies show a 
shopping list will discourage 
impulse buying and save you 
money 

Also, it generates a per serving 
calorie counter. This is easy to 
delete anytime you are not in a 
diet mood or want to celebrate 
for any reason 

RANDOMLY DELICIOUS 

Say goodbye to boring meals 
Your computer will remember 
variety is the spice of life This 
system makes eating at home a 
pleasure again Each menu is 
randomly generated from 5 
major food groups according to 
the specific criteria you select 
The Pizza Program is easy to 



learn and operate. Yet it is a 
sophisticated piece of software 
which will prevent menu mixups. 

The Pizza Program is a com- 
plete menu planning system you 
customize to fit your tastes and 
budget It's not a recipe file but 
rather a practical way to organize 
your meal planning. You'll appre- 
ciate It day after day, week after 
week. People across the country 
are finding it a super idea— a 
great companion to any kitchen. 

SEND NO MONEY NOW 

You can try it with no obliga- 
tion. Our home trial lets you 
actually use The Pizza Program 
for a full 15 days before you de- 
cide to keep it. Watch the fun and 
convenience it creates. Enjoy 
better meals and see how much 
time it saves. If you are not satis- 
fied for any reason, return it 
within 15 days and owe nothing. 
If you approve, you'll be billed 
later for just $34.50 plus $2 for 
shipping and handling. (Cali- 
fornia residents add 6''.% sales 
tax). A full 40 pages of instruc- 
tions are included. 

OUT OF THE RUT 

One woman's reaction to this 
program is typical. She wrote, 
"Before using your system I 
found myself getting into a rut 
of serving the same things over 
and over. The Pizza Program has 
changed all of this for me. We 
now have a wider variety of din- 
ners and best of all I don't have 
to decide what they will be. If 
this was all it did, I'd be thrilled. 
But it isn't. The shopping list I 
receive along with my menus 
has been such a time-saver I 
quickly run through it and delete 
anything I feel I don't need and 
add something I might. I would 
have a hard time going back to 
doing my menus by hand." 

This system is available for 
both the IBM PC, XT and the 
Apple II Plus or He', (Also runs 
on compatible systems) We urge 
you to take advantage of our 
no-risk, 15 day free trial offer. To 
order send us your name, address 
with zip code, and the name of 
your computer. We'll rush you 
The Pizza Program to try at no 
obligation. So write today.

"two," and X = 8 gives us "three." -\ 

The headers are very simple. For example, for the message "two" the i 
header is LDX #4: JMP LOOP— in which LOOP is the starting address, 
of the main print-a-string routine, JMP is the assembly language jump"] 
command, and the # symbol in front of 4 means "Use the value 4, not ; 
the value that is stored at memory address 4." | 

The Complete Program. Here is the complete program. Of course this 
is only a model; you probably don't need a program that outputs the 
words "one," "two," and "three." (With a little extra effort, you can 
change the strings to anything you might find useful. Just translate your 
message into ASCII codes — use the chart on page 7 of Ihe Apple II Ref- 
erence Manual — and replace the strings in this example. Don't forget to 
include a terminating character for each one. Note: You can also use the . 
chart on page 16 of the Apple lie Reference Manual; but you must use 
the hex values in the chart and add $80 to each value. If your strings are 
of different lengths than the ones given here, you will have to recalculate 
the X values given in the headers, but that shouldn't be difficult. You can 
use more than three strings, of course, but you must include a separate 
header for each.) 

Note that the total number of bytes, counting the routine itself, the 
headers, and the characters in the strings, must be less than 200 bytes. 
Otherwise you will overwrite part of memory that is being used by other 
Apple programs (DOS, for one), which will cause problems. 

Using the program is simple enough. After you have entered it or 
bloaded it it from disk, you can output a string in the middle of a Basic 
program by inserting the command call x, in which x represents the start- 
ing address of the header for the desired string: In the model, the starting 
addresses are 770 (decimal) for "one," 775 for "two," and 780 for 
"three." Since the headers are five bytes long, the call addresses will be 
five bytes apart, which makes them easier to remember. 

Note that the last header in the group — number three, in this case — is 
not five bytes long. It does not need a jump command, since the pro- 
gram simply falls through to the main loop, without having to jump any- 
where. This saves the three bytes necessary for the jump instruction. 

Setting It Up. There are several ways of entering an assembly lan- 
guage program into the Apple's memory. The simplest way, of course, is 
to bload it from disk, but to do that you have to have the program on 
disk. How do you get it there? Why, first you have to type it in, and then 
you can bsave it. So what's the easiest way to type it in? 

Use an assembler program, if you have one. An assembler program 
is a kind of editing program, with special features designed to help in 
writing assembly language programs. With a good assembler, writing as- 
sembly language is almost as easy as writing Basic. 

You don't have to have an assembler in order to use this program. 
You can enter the program through the Apple Monitor. This is a pro- 
gram built into the Apple (usually in read-only memory, or ROM), 
which is designed to aid you in entering and debugging machine lan- 
guage programs. We'll have a whole article on the Monitor one of these 
days, but in the meantime, here's a brief introduction. You can find more 
information in the Apple reference manuals starting on page 39 of the Ap- 
ple II manual or page 87 of the Apple He manual. 

Using the Monitor, you can enter bytes of machine code in hexa- 
decimal directly into the Apple's memory. The accompanying listing 
(which was prepared with the Merlin assembler program) gives you the 
machine code; so all you have to do is type it in. 

On the left-hand side of the listing, you will find a bunch of funny 
numbers — actually letters and numbers intermixed, using the numbers 0 
through 9 and the letters A through F. These are hexadecimal numbers. 
The letters are single-digit versions of the numbers ten through fifteen re- 
spectively, but that's a story for another day. For now, you don't have to 
understand them, you just have to copy them accurately. 

The first column consists of four-digit numbers: These are memory 
addresses. After each address, there are two (or maybe three, or some- 
times only one) bytes of machine code, shown as two-digit hexadecimal 
numbers. The first byte after each address is to be stored at that address, 
with the other bytes (if any) following it in successive memory locations. 

Note that the fifth column, which is taller, is not in hexadecimal. Do 
not enter these numbers as part of the code. They're hne numbers for the 
assembler; the Monitor wouldn't know what to do with them.

String output routine. The code to the left of the 1 through 34 column is what 
you type directly into the Apple Monitor if you don't have an assembler. To 
the right are the same commands as you would type them into an assembler. 



In order to enter the code, you must first call up the Monitor pro- 
gram. Type call —151 . The normal Applesoft prompt will be replaced by 
an asterisk (*), which is the Monitor prompt. That tells you that the 
Monitor is now up and running. 

Type in the first address shown in the listing, 302 (you needn't type 
the leading zero), and a colon to tell the Monitor that you want to start 
entering code at that address. Then type in the bytes of machine code, 
separated by spaces. After you enter the two bytes on the first line, con- 
tinue with the second line. Skip the address this time (the Apple already 
knows where you are) and just type the three bytes of code. Then go to 
the third line and continue until you have typed in all the bytes. Then 
press return and the program will be entered. 

Your typing should look like this: 

302:A2 00 40 OE 03 A2 04 . . . 05 05 OD 

If you need to break off in the middle, type return; when you start up 
again, begin with a colon (no address is required, if you haven't entered 
anything else since you broke off) and continue entering bytes as before. 

When you have entered the complete program (and typed return af- 
ter it), you can check your work by typing 302L. The Monitor will list the 
program you entered (in a form somewhat simpler than the magazine 
listing) and you can check its accuracy by comparing the codes. 

And that's it. The program is now in the Apple's memory, and you 
can use it by typing call 770 from Applesoft to see the first string. 

In order to save the program, you will need to know its length. You 
can either count the bytes, or (if you know how to subtract hexadecimal 
numbers) use the difference between the address you started at and the 
address you ended up at (plus one). Or you can simply assume a length 
of $C8 (hexadecimal for 2(X)). It won't hurt if you save a longer section of 
memory than you actually used. Then you save the program with bsave 
string output, A$302,L$C8. When you bload it again, it will automatical- 
ly be put back into the same place in memory. 

And that's all there is to it. Now your Apple has yet another way to 
talk back to you!

•APPLE IS A REGISTERED TRADE MARK OF YOU-KNOW-WHO 



BEAGLE BASIC 

APPLESOFT ENHANCER 
by MARK SIMONSEN 



Requires Apple lie (or 11/11+ with RAM Card)— 

Normally, Applesoft is unchangeable. What you 
see is what you get. But BEAGLE BASIC puts 
Applesoft into RAM, letting you customize and 
enhance it. The following functions may be 
added at ZERO COST IN MEMORY- 
RENAME ANY COMMAND or Error Mes- 
sage. You can literally re-write Applesoft with 
new commands. For program protection, encryp- 
tion, or even foreign translation! Even the new 
commands that follow are re-nameable: 

ELSE: Common in many programming lan- 
guages, but missing from Applesoft until now. 
ELSE follows If-Then statements, like this— 
IF X=2 THEN PRINT "Yes": ELSE PRINT "No" 

SWAP: Normally, to swap two variable values, 
you need a 3rd variable & an extra split-second. 
SWAP X,Y exchanges values in one quick step. 

TONE: Beagle Basic's TONE P, L command 
plays a note of Pitch P, Length L. It's simple — no 
messy Pokes or Calls are ever necessary. 

HSCRN: If you have ever used Lo-Res's SCRN 
command, you'll appreciate HSCRN X,Y for find- 
ing the off/on status of any hi-res dot. 

TXT2: Allows Text Page 2 to act like Page 1 , for 
printing, listing, etc. Switching pages opens up a// 
kinds of programming possibilities. 

MIX, PAGE, RESL and MODE: No more 
awkward graphics screen-switch pokes. For ex- 
ample, type PAGE1 or PAGE2 to switch pages, 
instead of POKE -16300,0 or POKE -16299,0 
(never look-up those darn Pokes again!). 

GOTO & GOSUB may now be followed by 
variables. Use English-like commands such as 
"GOSUB COUNTER" or "GOTO SONG", where 
COUNTER and SONG have been assigned line- 
number values. "GOTO 3+X", etc., legal too. 

ESCAPE-CURSOR: Normally, you can't tell 
if you are in Escape Mode (moving the cursor). 
With Beagle Basic, hitting ESC temporarily 
changes the normal cursor to a flashing "+". 

BETTER BEEP: Select one-of-many more 
pleasing tones for Apple's control-G Bell. 

PLUS: Bonus Screen Formatter & Editor, new 
1-word commands to replace awkward Apple 
text Calls, new commands to scroll text up and 
down, not possible before Beagle Basic. And... 

INVERSE REM STATEMENTS Too: 

Makes REM-statements appear as bxDid stand- 
out headlines in your Applesoft listings.

PRONTO-DOS 

HIGH-SPEED DOS/DOS-MOVE UTILITY 
by TOM WEISHAAR 

PRONTO-DOS triples the speed of Apple's Disk 
Operating System, adds new DOS features, and 
lets you load DOS into auxiliary memory for an 
EXTRA 10K of programmable memory space! 
Here is a comparison with normal Apple DOS- 



Function Nomial Pronto 

BLOAD HI-RES IMAGE 10 sec. 3 sec. 

LOAD 60-SECTOR PROGRAM 16 sec. 4 sec. 
SAVE 60-SECTOR PROGRAM 24 sec. 9 sec. 
BLOAD LANGUAGE CARD . . 13 sec. 4 sec. 
(Text Files: no change) 

New, unprotected, high-speed disks (as many as 
you want), are created with the normal INIT 
command. Or your existing disks may be 
updated. Booting Pronto or any updated disk in- 
stalls high-speed DOS in your Apple. 

Moving DOS to your Apple II or 11+ RAM Card 
or Apple He standard high-memory will free up a 
whopping 10,000 EXTRA BYTES (thafs 10K!) of 
valuable programmable memory space. 

ProntoDOS gives you 15 EXTRA SECTORS of 
disk storage space, almost one full track! This is 
space that is normally wasted by Apple DOS. 

With ProntoDOS in your Apple, all disk cata- 
logs will feature a Free-Space-On-Disk display, 
every time you Catalog. A great benefit! 

ProntoDOS allows you to add a handy new 
"TYPE" COMMAND that reveals the contents of 
Apple Text Files. For example, the command 
"TYPE INFO" will print everything (to screen or

CX)MPUTER/LAW CENTER FOCUSES 
ON AiACHINES AND MAGISTRATES 



Even more difficult than trying to keep up 
with the flood of new computer products and 
technology is trying to make sense of the legal 
asperts of the Information Age. 

One has only to read the daily newspaper 
to realize how important the law is to the com- 
puter industry. Hardly a day passes where 
there isn't a story about software or hardware 
copyright infringements, contractual hassles, 
or good old theft of corporate secrets. 

The big question is, what is the law? If a 
law hasn't been written to handle a specific 
situation, then what does an individual or 
company do? 

"The law usually trails industry by a 
generation," says Michael Scott, editor of The 
Scott Report and founder of the Center for 
Computer/Law in Manhattan Beach, Cali- 
fornia. "Currently, the courts are totally at sea 



and the only remedy is to go to Congress and 
make them clarify what the law is." 

As confusing and distressing as the cur- 
rent situation is, some people are working to 
make it better. Scott is one of these, a sharp in- 
dividual tackling one of the most challenging 
and volatile fields in the world today — 
computers and the law. 

The Center for Computer/Law was 
founded in 1977 by Scott and a number of at- 
torneys and law professors. It's a nonprofit in- 
stitution focusing on the legal problems of the 
computer and telecommunications industries, 
a focal point for research and articles on 
computer law. 

"When we started, six years ago, a lot of 
the material being published about the sub- 
ject was dead wrong, even shoddy," says

RETURN OF 
THE CHIP 
INDUSTRY 

The demand for computer chips has been 
rising sharply since early this spring, so much 
so that most chip manufacturers are having 
trouble meeting the increased demand. The 
delays in delivering chips to computer manu- 
facturers have been getting longer and longer, 
and many chip makers are saying that they 
may have to restrict the amounts their custom- 
ers can order. 

The situation is great for the semiconduc- 
tor industry — which struggled through two 
years of recession, closing down production 
lines and laying off many employees — but not 
so good for some computer manufacturers. In 
July, Intel Corporation reported that its sec- 
ond-quarter net income had nearly tripled 
from a year earlier. Previously struggling Na- 
tional Semiconductor reported that its net in- 
come for the fourth quarter ending May 31 
was more than double that of last year's 
fourth quarter. 

The rise in demand and the shortage of 
product is giving the buyers of chips corpo- 
rate migraines. Already some computer manu- 
facturers are being forced to buy chips at in- 
flated prices, and industry executives expect 
the situation to get worse before it gets better 
sometime next year. Industry scuttlebutt has it 
that Atari is hard put to meet its October 1 re- 
lease date of the low-priced Atari 600XL be- 
cause it can't get enough chips for the new 
machine. 

The pressure caused by the chip shortage 
will be greatest on young computer com- 
panies lacking established relationships with 
chip makers. The shortage will surely muck up 
some computer manufacturers' holiday sea- 
son plans. 

Semiconductor industry executives say 
that computer makers alone aren't increasing 
the demand. The military establishment and 
the telecommunications, office automation, 
and automotive industries are also respon- 
sible for the increased demand. In the past six 
months, the market has changed, causing both 
chip makers and buyers to scramble to solve 
the problem. 

In January of this year, buyers could 
expect delivery of many chips in a matter of 
days. Zilog, manufacturer of the Z-80 cpu 
chip, turned orders around in about fifteen 
working days. Now the company is warning 
buyers to expect to wait nine to fourteen 
weeks for delivery of chips. 

Many chips makers are warning their cus- 
tomers to plan ahead, particularly since the 
practice of allocating chips among buyers may 
become necessary. All indications point to this 
happening in the near future. National Semi- 
conductor has already begun allocating cer-

Veterans Administration Customizes an 
Industrial Robot for the Handicapped 



In the last decade, computers have lent 
their special talents to the handicapped and 
disabled. Today, robots are beginning to ex- 
pand those talents even farther. 

Some of the most promising work in the 
field of robotics for the handicapped is being 
done by the Veterans Administration with the 
help of scientists and doctoral students at 
Stanford University. 

"In identifying vocational task develop- 
ment needs, we went to C-4 quadriplegics 
[paralyzed below shoulder level] working in 
the community and asked them what they 
most needed to be able to do that they could 
not," recalls K.G. Englehardt, project evalu- 
ation supervisor and clinical director at the 
V.A. hospital in Palo Alto, California. 

"The response was, 'Put a disk in a disk 
drive' and 'Open a file cabinet drawer, take 
out a file, and open it.' That was a surprise; 
those aren't the obvious things that you might 
suppose a severely disabled person would 
most need to do." 

With those responses in mind, Stanford 
developed a voice-activated system that util- 
izes a modified Puma 250 industrial robot arm 
connected to a Zilog 80 computer, a Votrax 
voice synthesizer, and a Voterm voice-recog- 
nition device. Stanford associate professor of 
mechanical engineering Larry Leiffer, who 
worked on the design of the system, calls it a 
departure from the usual approach to high- 
tech aid for the handicapped in that the robot 
is not a replacement of a body part but a com- 
panion to the user, operated at a distance. 

Currently, the robot arm can perform 
multiple tasks that are part of daily living, but 
the engineers still have to work on getting the 
robot to put a disk in a disk drive. 

"At this stage, it's still not a turnkey sys- 
tem," says Englehardt, "though we're work- 
ing to make it as accessible as possible, so that, 
ideally, a quadriplegic could just wheel up to it 
and get started right away." 

After a year of intense interdisciplinary 
work, the research team has been able to re- 
duce to about forty-live minutes the user 
training time necessary to instruct the robot in 
a simple action, such as getting a glass of wa- 
ter. Cooking (putting a prepackaged meal in an 
oven) and certain vocational tasks are cur- 
rently within the robot's abilities, as are vari- 
ous recreations: The robot can wield a paint- 
brush and play board games, executing moves 
at the user's command. But the more com- 
plex tasks still take up to ten hours of 
training. 

Operating the robot is more analogous to 
flying a spaceship than to driving a car, ex- 
plains Englehardt. "You have forward, back, 
up, down, left, right, roll, pitch, and yaw. The 
manual is currently 190 pages in length." 




Englehardt says the robot can now recog- 
nize fifty-eight spoken words, and the accu- 
racy of the recognition has improved from 84 
or 85 percent at the time the project started to 
about 95 percent. 

Currently in a home with four quadri- 
plegics, the robot arm will next go to a long- 
term-care facility for "task design," in which 
quadriplegics and attendants will identify ap- 
plications and help design tasks for the robot 
to perform. 

In the future, the Stanford team plans to 
add other senses besides hearing to the robot. 
A mobile base is under development, though 
it cannot be vpice-controlled as yet and has 



not been a part of the V.A. clinical evaluation. 

And when will the current system or one 
like it be generally available to institutions and 
individuals? 

"It depends entirely on how much money 
the Veterans Administration is willing to put 
into it," says Englehardt. "We have spent 
$72,000 on the system. Interestingly, some of 
the parts can be purchased now for less than 
they cost us originally. 

"The technology is here. We estimate that 
in five to ten years a system of this sort could 
be sold for the price of a medium-sized auto- 
mobile — again, depending on the level of 
funding." AC 



NTT Announces 
Creation of 
Advanced Chip 

Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Cor- 
poration (NTT) — Japan's AT&T — opened 
its fourth major laboratory less than two 
months ago. A week after the lab opened, 
NTT coincidentally announced that it had 
succeeded in making a 1,000-bit memory chip 
on which 10.000 Josephson Junctions are in- 
tegrated. 

The race between U.S. and Japanese 
computer firms to build a fifth-generation 
computer is in full swing, and NTT's an- 
nouncement came as a mild surprise. No 
other company had announced the integra- 
Uon of Josephson Junctions onto memory 
chips at that time. 

Essentially, a Josephson JuncUon is a 
bridge between two superconductors that al- 
lows current to pass from one superconduc- 
tor to the other even when there is no voltage 
difference between the two. 

Superconductors are certain metals that 



have virtually no electrical resistance when 
kept at an extremely cold temperature (never 
higher than minus 422 degrees) and can sus- 
tain an electrical current indefinitely. At room 
temperature, an electrical current flows only 
when there is a voltage difference, just as 
water flows through a garden hose connect- 
ing two pools only if one pool is higher than 
the other. 

Josephson Junctions use a magnetic field 
to control the flow of current across the bridge 
connecting the superconductors. The current 
can be switched on or off in one hundred bil- 
lionths of a second. A computer made with 
Josephson Junctions could be twenty fimes 
faster than one made with today's best semi- 
conductor technology. 

Josephson Junctions also require con- 
siderably less power and generate much less 
heat than semiconductors. Because of the lat- 
ter attribute, computer components could be 
packed closer together without risking 
damage to the machine's reliability. A ma- 
chine based on Josephson Junctions with the 
same power as an IBM mainframe might fit 
into a cube measuring six inches on a side. 

NTT's new $99.1-million laboratory, lo- 
cated in the Tokyo suburb of Atsugi, was built 
to accelerate NTT's research into VLSIs —

Computer Profile Puts a Halt 
To Fictitious-Employer Scam 



Criminals, by nature, are an inventive 
breed. And, in order to combat all the vari- 
ous forms of criminal activity, law enforcers 
must also be inventive. 

A few years ago in California, a certain 
kind of white-collar crime went virtually un- 
detected until the damage had been done and, 
in some cases, the criminal had fled the coop. 
The crime involves setting up a phony busi- 
ness, hiring fictitious employees, paying un- 
employment-insurance taxes for the nonexis- 
tent employees, laying off the fictitious em- 
ployees, and then collecting the bogus em- 
ployees' jobless-benefit payments. 

Known as the "fictitious-employer 
scheme," this kind of white-collar scam can be 
very lucrative — one New York man created 
twenty-eight phony corporations with 168 fic- 
titious employees and hauled in $600,000 be- 
fore he was apprehended. 

Nowadays, with the help of a fictitious- 
employer profile and a special computer pro- 
gram, investigators at California's Employ- 
ment Development Department are not only 
detecting every case of the fictitious-employer 
scheme but are detecting such schemes faster, 
before the phony employer has stolen more 
than a few thousand dollars. 

Former LAPD detective Robert Keel, 
now chief investigator for California's EDD, 
developed the fictitious-employer profile in 
1978. When Keel started at the EDD in 1976, 
he says there was only a "hand tally" system for 
keeping track of employers and the payment 
of unemployment-insurance benefits, and no 
one knew how much the state was being 
ripped off 

The fictitious-employer profile and its at- 
tendant computer program were developed 



through funds provided by the Department of 
Labor, which requires that states have some 
form of detection for this kind of fraud. Basi- 
cally, the system compares wage data submit- 
ted by employers and unemployment-insur- 
ance claims data with a profile constructed 
from data of all the different ways people have 
perpetrated this kind of white-collar fraud. 

Keel and his staff use terminals to tap into 
the state's Health and Welfare Data Center, 
which has all the current employer and em- 
ployee data. They examine the employer enti- 
ties that apply for unemployment-insurance 
benefits and determine if the companies are 
valid, even to the point of occasional field 
checking. "We'll check out the address," says 
Keel, "and make sure it isn't a vacant lot." 

California's EDD has had such success 
with the system that about thirty other states 
are setting up similar programs. "We've 
proven that we've saved a lot of money," says 
Keel. "There are not a horrendous amount of 
fictitious-employer frauds, four or five cases a 
year, but each one has the potential for cost- 
ing the state a hell of a lot of money." 

An ironic twist to the whole story, says 
Keel, is what happens now after a fraud case is 
detected and the criminal apprehended. De- 
tecting a phony business is one thing, but the 
state will not prosecute until the fictitious em- 
ployer has actually collected the phony-em- 
ployee benefits. 

"In the old days," says Keel, "when these 
kinds of criminals were making off with 
amounts like $80,000. the state prosecutor 
would jump all over the case. Now, when we 
catch them after only a few thousand dollars 
has been stolen, the cases are low on the prose- 
cutor's list of priorities." DH

Documentation Etc. 



Washington State Firm Aims To 
Improve Documentation Writing 



For years now, it's been fashionable to 
complain about the poor quality of user man- 
uals, in-house training materials, and other 
technical documentation. This past January, 
Science Information Associates, a three-year- 
old firm based in Federal Way, Washington, 
began to address the issue with a more con- 
structive attitude. The six-person company ini- 
tiated publication of Documentation Etc., a 
bimonthly newsletter directed toward high- 
tech professionals with an interest in improv- 
ing the quality and efficacy of their written 
communications. 

The Science Information Associates staff 
includes technical writers, a technical consult- 
ant, a copywriter, an art director, and a graph- 
ics artist. In addition to publishing Documen- 
tation Etc., the group conducts seminars and 
does consulting, writing, editing, and produc- 
tion work for high-tech firms. 

Before forming Science Information As- 
sociates in July 1980, company founder Ni- 
chole Vick worked as a technical writer, pub- 
lic information specialist, and publications 
manager for various scientific publications. 
Fascinated by technology, Vick is convinced 
that it is possible — and essential — for people 
to communicate clearly about hardware, 
software, and other computer-related mat- 
ters. The firm's vice president is Vick's hus- 
band, Ray Styles, whose previous experience 



NTT 



continued from page 288 



especially those employing Josephson Junc- 
tions and gallium arsenide. Using two IBM 
308 1-K mainframes and a Fujitsu main- 
frame, the lab is testimony to NTT's commit- 
ment to keep up with, if not outpace, Amer- 
ican research. Prior to 1981, when a U.S.- 
Japan government procurement agreement 
went into effect, NTT had never used a large 
foreign-made computer in its research. 

On this side of the Pacific, American firms 
are not worried much by NTT's announce- 
ment of the Josephson Junction integrated 
chip. It's well known around the industry that 
IBM is probably the world leader in Joseph- 
son Junction research; it's also well known 
that IBM doesn't talk much about its on- 
going research. Even NTT concedes that IBM 
has more accumulated knowledge of the ad- 
vanced technology, though no one outside of 
Big Blue knows how far that company has 
progressed. 

Another NTT competitor, AT&T, is also 
working on Josephson Junctions through its 
research arm. Bell Laboratories. DH 



involved the programming and design of com- 
puter applications software and operating 
systems. 

In the course of their professional lives, 
both Vick and Styles have read volumes upon 
volumes of technical material, the majority of 
it disappointing. At first, says Vick, the idea of 
doing documentation writing was excifing to 
her, but after reading much of it she had the 
impression that "people must not really want 
it to be good; their work violated all the prin- 
ciples of good technical writing." 

After thinking things over, she came to the 
conclusion that the poor quality of the mate- 
rials they'd read had more to do with the fact 
that the people involved really didn't know 
how to create good documentafion. She also 
realized that most organizations give docu- 
mentation very low priority. Budget con- 
straints, tight schedules, and historical prece- 
dent all contribute to the notion that docu- 
mentation is less than essential, "frosting on 
the cake." As Ray Styles puts it, "When 
you're fighting fires, you want to get the pro- 
gram running; you'll worry about explaining it 
later." 



291 



Vick and Styles see this attitude as short- 
.sighted. Companies that don't create useful, 
easily understood documentation for their in- 
house systems and their end-u.ser products 
cost themselves time and money down the 
road because they are constantly getting que.s- 
tions from users who can't find the answer in 
the manual. In addition, companies forfeit the 
advantages that clear, organized thinking and 
communicating would give them in their 
daily work. 

Documentation Etc. is one significant way 
Science Information Associates is attempting 
to change people's attitudes about the impor- 
tance of good documentation. Each issue of 
the newsletter focuses on a specific documen- 
tation or marketing-related concern. The Jan- 
uary/February topic was user manual design, 
and readers received a useful, thoughtfully il- 
lustrated introduction to the principles of 
graphic design. March/April's installment ex- 
plored the idea of using documentation as a 
project management tool. In May/June, the 
subject was user manuals once again, but this 
time the emphasis was on content — what 
makes a good manual and how do you go 
about creating one? The July/ August edifion 
focused on the development of internal docu- 
mentation standards. Each issue also features 
a question-and-answer section. 

Communicating about communicating 
isn't easy. The people at Science Information 
Associates just make it look that way. JV

legal aspects of the computer industry, as well 
as publishing a series of monographs and 
books, such as the Computer Law Bibliog- 
raphy. The Center for Computer/Law draws 
upon the expertise of a network of lawyers, 
law professors, and other individuals for its 
consulting and publishing activities. 

Scott says that the Computer/ Law Journal 
is meant to give the center's members a "snap- 
shot of what's going on out there. Rather than 
just reacting to problems as they come up, 
companies are trying to forestall the prob- 
lems, basing their actions on legal prec- 
edents." 

Members of the center use what Scott says 
is "the largest collection of published mate- 
rials on computer law, outside of the Library 
of Congress." In the last three years, the cen- 
ter has collected close to twelve hundred vol- 
umes of books and publications from all over 
the world. One of its all-volunteer staff mem- 
bers spends a third of his time tracking down 
material for the library. 

The center is currently working on several 
special projects. The first is an information 
sourcebook, which will be a watershed of 
information for those working in the areas of 
computer and communication law. It will in- 
clude a bibliography of periodicals, a listing of 
organizations, a listing of all relevant state and 
federal agencies, legislative committees and 
other government organizations, and a bio- 
graphical listing of important persons in these 
fields from around the world. 

The center is also working on a legislative 
compendium — a compilation of all state and 
federal laws and regulations in the areas of 
computers, communications, and informa- 
tion regulation — as well as an on-line data- 
base of all books, monographs, and articles 
written in the areas of computer and commu- 
nication law. 

Individuals or institutions can become 
members of the center for a reasonable fee 
that includes a year's worth of the Com- 
puter/ Lmw Journal and a 20 percent discount 
on all books and monographs published by 
the center. 

Sharing the same building with the Center 
for Computer/Law is the Law & Technology 
Press, a commercial company that Scott also 
founded. Currently, the Press publishes two 
monthly journals/newsletters. The Scott Re- 
port and Software Protection. 



Both The Scott Report and Software Pro- i 
tection are more timely than the Com- 
puter/Law Journal. Both journals offer in- - 
depth analysis of new cases and can be very up 
to date, reporting on cases only weeks old. 

Scott sees interesting developments in the 
future regarding contracting and piracy, but 
these are minutia compared to some of the po- 
tential legal developments as computers be- 
come a major force in our lives. He sees a pos- 
sible clash forming between those who have 
knowledge and access to computers and those 
who do not. 

"There could be a class distinction be- 
tween those who are computer-literate and 
those who are computer-illiterate, with the lat- 
ter demanding equal access to the technology. 
For instance, suppose an American bank does 
an economic analysis of a South American 
country and then refuses to let the country see 
the results? The country is going to demand 
equal access to information on themselves." 

Scott sees inequality arising from those 
who have the power of the computer denying 
it to those who do not. "Those who do not 
have the technology will realize they are at a 
disadvantage and will start demanding their 
computer rights, like people now demand 
their civil rights." 

The growing trend toward personal com- 
puters could be the "battleground" where 
some of these concerns are resolved, accord- 
ing to Scott. 

One scenario would have the computer in- 
dustry coming under government regulation 
so that those who can afford the technology 
would subsidize those who can't. 

"In the long run, the computer industry 
could be made into a public utility. Take the 
phone company. There might be a backlash 
once people realize what deregulation means. 
They may want the government to step in 
again. 

"The concept of computers as a utility is 
not new. An interesting book was written on 
the subject in the early seventies. It's an argu- 
ment that's coming back into vogue, to regu- 
late the industry for the best public interest. 
Maybe we're smarter than that now." DH

Matarazzo, in an editorial published in the

ing use of computers for psychological test-

wholesale use of automated tests by people 
without a knowledge of their limitations will 
be a disservice to the public." Matarazzo 
stresses that the results of computerized psy- 
chological tests still must be scientifically ap- 
praised. Even when carried out by experts, the 
interpretation of such tests is not an objective 
activity. He concludes, rather gloomily, "My 
experience as an expert witness leaves me in 
no doubt that a flood of litigation involving 
unqualified users of the products of this new 
technology is just around the corner."

STORY TALK FICTION 

DRAGON, DRAGON, 
BURNING BRIGHT 

Iff Usa Michaels Jones 

His favorite computer magazine was waiting for him in his mail when 
Dave arrived home (late again) that Tuesday. Thank God, he thought to 
himself. At least I can salvage something from this day. But he didn't al- 
low himself the luxury of reading it from cover to cover yet. He walked 
into the kitchen area, plopping the mail in a heap on the breakfast bar, 
and opened the refrigerator, not really hoping for much. There was some 
fresh corn, bought from the old man who had a small orchard down the 
street, half a gallon of milk, three beers, and some celery that had seen 
better days. Not much to go on. He sighed and decided he wasn't hun- 
gry. Tiglath — who had followed him in — was, so he opened a can of 
Furry Friends Feline Food for him. 

"So Where's Jenny?" he asked Tiglath. "Asleep again?" Tiglath, his 
mouth full, didn't answer. Dave shrugged. She probably was. Jenny, a 
delicately boned black-and-white cat, was a refugee from the pound; Tig- 
lath was a legacy from John, a friend who had taken a job in Britain and 
didn't want to subject his cat to long quarantines and a generally un- 
pleasant lifestyle. Tiglath was orange — John had always said he imag- 
ined the Assyrian kings of that name to be fond of orange. But John was 
a little strange anyway. Dave took a beer and went to savor his 
magazine. 

A half hour later he had made it to the classifieds and had been cap- 
tivated. An ad promised "a new computer adventure game that will 
make others seem lifeless by comparison," and the company. The Hap- 
py Dragon, was just over the hill in Santa Ilusivo. The game was only 
twenty dollars; so, even if it didn't live up to its promise, at least he 
wouldn't have lost much. A drive to Santa Ilusivo would be a welcome 
break. His BMW hadn't had much exercise lately besides driving to and 
from work. He called the store, only to reach an answering machine stat- 
ing hours. They closed early on weekdays, so he wouldn't be able to go 
until the weekend. 

"Damn," Dave swore quietly. Lately life had not been working for 
him, and to have to wait until the weekend for even this small promise of 
escape seemed too much. He was young; he had the job he'd always 
wanted and was paid well for it; he even owned his own house. But he 
felt flat, empty. What had gone from his life? He didn't know, and, too 
tired to think about it, he went to bed. 

The rest of the week dragged. Work, which had once been exciting, 
was now a burden. An added frustration was that Dave didn't like to 
wait for anything once he'd made up his mind. With his salary, he usual- 
ly didn't have to, either. He'd bought his house on Union Avenue the 
day he'd first seen it — and he'd never regretted the decision. It was an 
older home, one well cared for, on a relatively untraveled street within 
walking distance of a fancy shopping center, and not a bad commute to 
Cordova either. Even during the worst of rush-hour traffic he could be at 
work within twenty minutes. It used to take him almost an hour from 
San Ardo. Bonita Springs would have been closer, but he hadn't liked 
any of the houses for sale there. Besides, it pleased him to live near one of 
the last remaining orchards in the entire valley — even the farms and or- 
chards of Morgan were becoming subdivisions and condos. Granted, it 
was a small orchard, but Bob, the man who owned it, had character. Bob 
always slipped extra ears of com or a few more apples or cherries into the 
bags of his favorite customers, and he always had something funny to say

SEPTEMBER 1983 



about the neighborhood events. Goings-on, he called them. 

Saturday Dave set off a little later than he had planned, but the day 
was overcast and so the beach traffic was light. He made it to Santa Ilu- 
sivo in good time, arriving as the sun was beginning to burn off the 
clouds. He followed the familiar route — down Ocean, right on Water, 
then over the bridge and left into the Cooper House area. He found The 
Happy Dragon between a potter's shop and a health food store. In the 
window was a display of fantasy gaming miniatures, all splendidly paint- 
ed. They were arranged in a tableau with an intricately wrought golden 
dragon, about eighteen inches long, as the central piece. Dave caught his 
breath at the workmanship that had gone into the dragon's making. Its 
eyes were especially striking — the wicked, knowing look in them made 
Dave laugh. They seemed to be tiny chips of some gem — garnet? Ruby? 
Dave couldn't tell, but they went perfectly with the glowing gold of the 
dragon's skin. The dragon was so detailed that Dave could make out in- 
dividual scales and see where the claws joined the toes; he could even see 
a faint tracery of what must have been veins in the leathery spines on its 
back. Such a work couldn't be for sale, but Dave would at least ask. He 
pushed open the dark-glassed door and entered the store. 

Inside, though it was dim, he could see the more usual fantasy gam- 
ing paraphernalia — unpainted miniatures, books, magazines devoted to the 
subject, posters, games. A small glass counter guarded oak wall cup- 
boards and a door to the back. No one was in sight. He walked to the 
counter. A grubby guest book with a hand-lettered cover ("Sign-ups for 
Games — See Evdna First"), a handbell with the crude representation of 
a bull's head, and another sign ("Ring for Service — At Your Own 
Risk!") were the only things there. Not even a cash register, just an 
abacus. He smiled, not very amused, at the bull, picked it up, and rang 
it — hard. Immediately the back door opened and a slender redheaded 
woman came out, shutting the door quickly behind her. But Dave would 
have sworn he had heard the sounds of a full-blown party come out with 
her. No door could be so thick as to block out completely the sounds of a 
party that big.

"How may I help you?" the redhead asked. She eyed him specula- 
tively. "You're new here. Do you belong to the Society?" 

"Not really. I live over the hill, in Winchester. But yes, this is my first 
time in this shop. What society?" 

She lost interest immediately. "Oh, just a small gaming group we 
have. What do you need?" 

"I'd like to buy the computer adventure game you advertised." 

"Oh. Yes. We have it available in several levels of experience. Do you 
ever play fantasy games?" 

"Yes, about twice a month." 

"How many years have you been playing?" 

"Since I was twelve — ten years. I used to play more when I was 
a kid." 

She thought a moment, then nodded. "You're probably a third 
level — there are seven in all." She unlocked the back of the counter and 
pulled out a plastic envelope with one disk in it. "It can be backed up 
once. If you try to make more, the original will destroy itself." She flicked 
the beads on the abacus. "That'll be twenty-one twenty, with tax." 

"Wait," Dave said. "I was wondering about the dragon in your win- 
dow. Is it for sale?" 

The redhead's interest sharpened. "What color was it?" 

Dave was always courteous and willing to allow for possibilities he 
might be unaware of. There was only one dragon in the window, but 
maybe someone had recently changed the display and she didn't know 
that. "Gold, with red eyes." 

"Gold?" she demanded. "Are you sure it was gold? Not orange?" 

Dave replied patiently, certain he was dealing with a burn-out. "Yes, 
gold. Very gold. Beautifully gold." 

His forbearance was showing. She gave him a sharp look, then said, 
"No, it isn't for sale, as you might guess by the workmanship. But would 
you excuse me a moment?" 

He could only nod and say, "Sure." She vanished into the back room, 
and this time he knew he heard loud male voices chanting an ear-burn- 
ingiy baudy song. But as soon as the door closed behind her all was si- 
lence again. It didn't take her long. She returned with a man robed in deep 
royal blue, as though for a role as wizard, and Dave began to want very 
intensely to see the other side of that door. 

"So, young man, you like the gold dragon," he said. He whispered, 
not quite low enough, to the redhead, "You did say he saw gold, didn't 
you, dear?" 

"Yes, Evdna," she answered directly. 

Dave's courtesy held, much as he disliked his word being ques- 
tioned. "Yes. I think it's beautiful. Who made it? Is it definitely not for 
sale? I can make a good offer." 

The older man, who seemed quite comfortable in his magician's robes, 
nodded. "Yes, yes, that dragon is a work of art. But it is definitely not for 
sale. However, we have some work by the same artist. It isn't as large, but 
I feel it may appeal to you as much." He fished around in a seemingly 
bottomless pocket awhile, finally pulling out a small key, then he turned 
and unlocked one of the oak cabinets on the wall. Inside, gold, silver, and 
glass figures gleamed briefly. Evdna pulled out a small brown velvet box. 
In it nestled a ring, a copy of the golden dragon — or so Dave thought un- 
til he examined it more closely. This one was also golden, with red eyes, 
but seemed to have an entirely different expression on its face. It was — 
friendly was the best word for it. Dave smiled to himself at the thought of 
a friendly dragon. The workmanship was as impressive as that of the 
larger dragon — or even more so, considering the much smaller size. Dave 
knew he had to have it. 

"How much?" 

Evdna smiled at his eagerness. "Twenty-five dollars. And yes, it's real 
gold — twenty-four-karat. We have an inexpensive source," he added, as 
if knowing Dave's next question. "And," he confinued, smoothly taking 
the packaged disk out of Dave's hand, "I think you might be happier 
with our level-seven game. It is much better suited to you. There is no 
extra charge." 

Dave was astounded at the low price. As he wrote a check for the 
ring and the disk, Evdna turned to leave. Apparently as an afterthought, 
he turned back. 

"Oh, by the bye. Do you have any pets?" 



"Yes. Two cats," Dave said, looking up from his checkbook. 

"Good. Take them with you when you adventure in our game." He 
smiled enigmatically and left. This time no bar noises could be heard 
when the door opened, but cool air, smelling of the night, drifted out, 
carrying with it the chirping of crickets. 

"What did he mean?" Dave asked the redhead, handing her the 
check. 

"You'll see when you read the instructions for creating characters," 
she said. This seemed all she was going to say, but then she added, "If 
anything — unusual — happens in the game, please come see us. We'll be 
glad to discuss any — difficulties — in the office in the back." She waved 
her hand in the general direction of the back door. "And we'll make 
amends if you so desire." She smiled. "But I don't think you'll have any 
problems." She stressed the last word oddly. Her smile was promising, 
too — quite a turnaround from the bored reception he had first been 
given. 

"Thank you," Dave said, determined to make up a problem just to 
get behind that door. "I'll be sure to let you know." She nodded, and 
he left. 

Once in his car, he carefully pulled away the tissue paper the redhead 
had wrapped around the ring. In the sun the dragon sparkled, almost 
alive in its sinuous beauty. Dave smiled at it. "Friendly dragon, you're 
mine." The sun gleamed off the tiny eyes. On impulse, Dave slipped the 
ring on his finger, then frowned. He hadn't actually thought of size yet, 
after a trace of initial looseness, the dragon seemed almost to snuggle 
around his finger, and a warmth, so faint he wasn't sure it was there, 
spread from the ring. It gave him a feeling of security, like that of having 
a trusted friend. He started the car, grinning. 

Crossing the bridge again, Dave noticed that the road seemed to 
shimmer as though a thousand thousand tiny diamonds had been scat- 
tered over the surface. He blinked, and the impression was gone. Maybe 
it was a new kind of bridge surface, he thought, that he just hadn't 
noticed before. After all, it had been overcast when he'd driven in. His 
eyes traced the delicate shape of the dragon on his hand, and he smiled. 
Then again, maybe not. He was no fool, and he was certainly open- 
minded. He could hardly wait to play the game. 

When he arrived home both Jenny and Tiglath greeted him at the 
door with interest in their eyes and stropped against his legs, making small 
sounds of welcome. He laughed; then, anxious, he sat down at the com- 
puter and tore open the plastic surrounding his new game. Both cats 
jumped into his lap, purring, and he absent-mindedly stroked them as he 
skimmed the first part of the instructions. How to boot the disk, how to 
make a backup — standard stuff. The "How To Play" section was of 
more interest. 

Character Creation: The First Step. The first character you 
should create is one with your own name. This is extremely im- 
portant to proper functioning of the game. 

Dave snorted. How would the game know? 

You will be asked to input data that you feel best character- 
izes your personal and physical traits. 

At the right time, if you have any animal friends, you will be 
asked to enter them. This is also extremely important, but only if 
your animals like you. If you have a dog, for example, who is not 
fond of you, do not enter it in the game. We cannot emphasize 
how vital this is to your well-being. This is an extraordinarily real- 
istic game, and you'll need all the friends you can take. Any talis- 
mans you own should be taken with you also. 

The game is arranged in levels of difficulty. The first level's 
object is to simply make it to the Inn — what Inn, and where it is, 
are questions you must answer while playing the game. After you 
have achieved this first objective, you will be informed concerning 
the objectives of the next levels. If you never finish the first level, 
well, too bad, and better luck in your next life. 

Actually, you will have many opportunities to try to reach the 
Inn — this is an equal-opportunity game and does not discrim- 
inate against dimwits. 



We must warn you again of the realism of this game. The 
graphics are of a quality never before seen on a computer .scTeen. 
You may actually feel you are in the game itself. Don't panic. 
Should you decide you have had enough play for one day, the ap- 
propriate ending procedure will be apparent. Should you die, you 
will automatically leave the game. In this event, we recommend 
you rest awhile before playing again. 

A Word about Commands: Any English word or sentence will 
be understood, and knowledge of other languages won't hurt. 

Now boot up and enjoy your adventure. 

Dave pulled out the disk, somewhat crestfallen. He had expected to 
be able to create an alter ego, another him, capable of some things that 
he wasn't. But then, many of the finest text adventures were basically just 
the interaction between the player's native wits and those of the pro- 
grammers of the game. He answered the prompts on the screen as best he 
could, adding Tiglath and Jenny when the time came. He almost an- 
swered the question "Talismans?" with a negative, until he remembered 
the golden dragon around his finger. He listed it. 

Finally he was ready to play. The screen came up with a forest, all in 
green (someday he'd get around to buying a color monitor), with text 
below. Dave experienced a sharp sense of disappointment. The graphics 
were only so-so; certainly nothing he hadn't seen before. The text wasn't 
even very original. "You are among many trees. Before and behind you 
is a path. With you are two cats. You are wearing a golden dragon. You 
see nothing special." Nothing special — that was for sure! Resignedly he 
typed in, "Walk south." 

The graphics shifted and Dave's interest renewed. He had never seen 
such smooth animation. It was as though he were walking down the 
path, with the perspective changing exactly as he'd expect. He even 
thought he heard a faint rustling, as of leaves, and a crunching of feet on 
gravel. Maybe this game had promise after all. But wait. Shouldn't the 
motion end? "Stop," he typed in experimentally. The picture halted, and

the same text came up again, adding, "You hear a small stream." Which 
he did. Also, there was a definite wind blowing; it sounded so realistic 
that he imagined he felt it in his hair. 
"Find stream," he typed. 

The trees shifted, then pulled apart to reveal a broad, quiet-running 
stream. He could see one branch in front of him — the graphics were so 
good he bet he could identify genus and species. It looked like a cherry 
tree. Now what? he wondered. He decided to test the claim that the 
game would accept any English word or sentence. 

"Now what?" 

"What is your objective?" came up on the screen. 
"To find the Inn. Where is it?" 
"That's for you to find out. Hint: It's over the hill." 
A sudden suspicion came into Dave's mind. Over the hill? A cherry 
orchard? Could a game do that? 
"Turn around," he typed. 

The picture on the screen swerved, and he was facing back the way 
he'd come. What he saw made his heart thump once very hard. It was an 
orchard, a small one, in full bloom. In the distance beyond the trees he 
could see a man bent over what had to be tomato plants. What stunned 
Dave was that the picture was in full color. He could even see Jenny in 
miniature, intent on a clump of grass. For several minutes all he could do 
was stare. Then his brain started to function again. There was no ra- 
tional way his green monitor could suddenly become a full-color one, and 
especially not one so beautifully true to life. Therefore he must be deal- 
ing with the irrational. Long years of adventure gaming braced him. He 
took a deep breath, then typed, "Say hello to Bob." 

The figure straightened, then started to walk toward him. When it 
arrived, it spoke. "Hello, Dave. See you've begun to explore the gaps of 
the rational world." It was Bob, and his voice was very clear. "Anything 
I can do to help? Don't bother typing your answer — just say it." 

The hair on the back of Dave's neck lifted slightly, but he spoke 
aloud. "Yes, I — um — I guess I'm looking for the Inn."

Bob nodded. "Thought so. Well, I guess you've figured out where 
you are. There are a few changes. The road here is a stream, for example. 
I arranged that — good for the trees. But the main thing right now is for 
you to get rid of the monitor and come all the way over. You can only go 
so far with it before you have to leg it the rest of the way. But you'll find 
ways to avoid the walk once you're here — you'll find plenty of ways." He 
seemed to find that amusing. "I can't help you with that — it's something 
you have to do on your own. Kind of the first test, y'see. Good luck. And 
eat that corn before it gets old." At that, Bob walked off, becoming 
smaller again, and bent over his tomatoes. 

Dave watched Bob's retreating back, an old excitement returning. A 
magical new world had become available, just when life seemed most 
ordinary. But was it legitimate? Or would he be found, days after, a 
mindless idiot or dead in front of his computer? Did it matter? Dave 
smiled. No. 

So how was he to get into — or over to, or whatever preposition was 
applicable — this game world? Probably only took some thinking. Dave 
leaned back and thought, reaching out to stroke the cats. But, wait — they 
were gone. 

"Jenny?" he called. "Tiglath?" He heard Jenny's answering chirp, but 
couldn't see her — until he looked at the screen. Sure enough, there she 
was, giving him a questioning look. Tiglath wasn't in sight. Dave stifled 
the sudden crazy impulse to go outside and run down the street to see if 
they were both at the orchard. He suspected they wouldn't be. But then 
. . . how did Bob manage to be in the game without others missing him? 
Could someone actually inhabit two worlds at once and operate in them 
simultaneously? He recalled something a psychic had written once, about 
how one's reality was all a matter of focus, and how there were thou- 
sands of other worlds available. One just needed to tune in to them, like 
tuning into a different radio station. But how did one do it? Dave closed 
his eyes again. The cats had done it somehow, and so had Bob; so, ap- 
parently, had many others. And so, he determined, would he. He concen- 
trated, trying to guess what it would feel like to tune into a magical 
world. Imagine, he told himself. A warm glow around his finger began, 
and he put his other hand to the dragon ring. "Other woHds exist," he 
whispered, "and you're proof, dragon. Help me!" 

It wasn't anything like he'd imagined. Suddenly the world just quiet- 
ly shifted, and he ofiened his eyes. His house had changed in subtle ways, 
but not much. It felt right, though. He walked outside, and in place of the 
road flowed a small stream. He wanted to shout, to laugh, but he felt as 
though any loud noise would jar him back to a chair in front of a green- 
screened monitor. He was soon at the orchard. "Hey, Bob," he called. 

Bob came over, grinning, and shook his hand. "Did it faster than I 
thought you would. World must be getting more open-minded. Want 
your cats? They're over in the pile of hay I keep around for them. At- 
tracts mice." At Dave's look, he laughed. "Oh yes, they come visiting all 
the time. Cats are good at it. Come on. They're over here." 

Dave followed Bob around the house. Tiglath and Jenny were there 
and looked up alertly — in anticipation, Dave thought — at the two men's 
arrival. Dave grinned at them. 

"How much do they know?" he asked Bob. 

"Oh, a lot. Don't underestimate them. Cats are good in a pinch, too. 
Know all sorts of ways out of a tight corner, and have a lot of friends you 
might not expect. Good thing you take care of them, or it wouldn't have 
done you any good at all to bring them along. Might have done you 
harm, in fact. But I imagine you were warned. They've started to warn 
people since that incident happened. Remember the guy who got torn up 
by his pit bull? Never thought anyone would be foolish enough to mis- 
treat an animal, then take it along." Bob shook his head. "Got what he 
was looking for, that's for sure. Though I can't say even he deserved it. 
Anyway, you'd best be going." Bob shook Dave's hand again. "Sure 
glad you made it." He walked off. Dave stared after him a few mo- 
ments. That unsettled, walking tightrope feeling had vanished while Bob 
talked, and he felt confident he wouldn't lose focus. Maybe that's why 
Bob had talked with him. Dave grinned, pleased with himself and the 
world. He was going to like this "game." He looked down at the cats. 

"Come on Jenny, Tiglath. We have an Inn to find." 31

best limerick didn't receive as many votes as tiie 
winning one. It did, however, receive votes from 
I a wider variety of people than those who stuffed 
i the ballot box with friends' and relatives' votes. 
Whereas limericks four, six, and eleven re- 
ceived the most votes, number ten was clearly 
the readers' choice. 

Limerick ten, by Brian Gaines (Colorado 
Springs, CO), was the one with all the Infocom 
references (troll, in foe combat, mark. Blankly, 
axe). It drew more votes from more varied 
sources than any other limerick; unfortunately, 
Gaines isn't as skilled in the art of ballot-box 
stuffing as were Kantor, Nancy Docken (lim- 
erick six), or John Henrick (limerick eleven). 
Which brings us to our next point — sour 
grapes. 

The voting had barely begun before we re- 
ceived a scathing letter from Henrick, who 
wanted to complain about the way the contest 
was being run. Henrick sent in twelve limericks 
and said later that the one we chose as a finalist 
wasn't his best. In fact, Henrick felt that at least 
six of his other entries were better than any of 
the finalists. 

If Henrick 's other limericks were really bet- 
ter than the ones we printed in June, that's his 
opinion, and he's entitled to it. We just hope 
those limericks didn't include the ones in which 
Henrick tried to rhyme quark with lark or lus- 
ter with Dog Star 

Henrick also felt that if he had won the con- 
test it wouldn't have been any big deal because 
of the lack of competition. But that didn't stop 
him from urging almost everyone in the Seattle 
and Vancouver areas to send in votes for him. 
There was even Angela Henrick of Seattle who 
voted twice! Tsk, tsk. 

If this contest proved anything, it proved 
that voting never proves anything. No more de- 
mocracy in this section. We don't deserve it. 

It really is too bad that a select few have to 
ruin a good thing for the whole group.

'BEAT TO QUARTERS! RUN OUT THE 
GUNS, AND CLEAR FOR ACTION!*' 



These urgent commands of the 18fh- 
century captain are now yours to issue as 
you re-enact legendary naval engagements 
from the age of fighting sail 

BROADSIDES'" — a new game from 
SSI — gives you non-stop naval action, as 
fast and demanding as the historical battles 
it re-creates. 

In this two-player/solitaire simulation, 
the ships will be rigged, manned, and armed 
just like the real ships were, and will handle 
in the wind just as real ships sailed. 

For speed of play, the ARCADE game 
lets you sail right into action. You set your 
course, maneuver and fire broadsides as fast 
as your crew can reload. 

For authenticity and his- 
torical detail, the TAC- 
TICAL game puts you 
on the quarter-deck. There, you 
make the decisions real captains had to 
make: How much sail? What course for 
best speed? Aim your guns for the 
rigging or waterline? What range? 
Load with solid shot or grape shot? 



When the ships move within grappling 
range, your boarding parties and sharp- 
shooters will decide the battle. As you 
watch the fighting on your screen, you'll 
give orders for your saber- wielding men to 
thrust, counter- thrust or hack away. 

If you want to design your own ships, 
BROADSIDES lets you build frigates and 
ships- of- the- line from the keel up, rigging 
them, manning them, and arming them 
with everything from 12-pounders to hull- 
smashing carronades. 

The enemy's guns have been rolled out, his 
sharpshooters are in his tops, and he's almost 
within range. The battle is about 
to begin.

Softalk Presents Hie Bestsellers 



It's pretty clear to observant pundits that Bert Kersey is in his dotage. 

There are areas where the experts can't agree. Which brother is Bert? 
Was the picture taken in his prime? Does he really have a disk drive in his 
ear? Does Bert just get his inspiration from Sophie the beagle, or does 
Sophie call the shots? 

There is even a school of thought that claims that Bert Kersey is a 
nom de plume of Barney Stone, who's always wanted to be tall. That line 
of pursuit is usually scoffed at, in that it would then follow that Stan 
Crane was Sophie, and nobody's noticed a propensity on the part of 
Stanley to step on his ears. 

Even with all these controversies raging, there's a general agreement 
that Kersey — whoever he might be — has been slacking off. Look at the 
July Bestseller results and you'll get the tale of the sales. All Bert did was 
capture seven of the slots in the Hobby 10. He had only five entries in the 
Top Thirty. 

The evidence seems clear that Bert's turning senile. So it goes with 
genius. Babe Ruth was barrel-shaped. Joe Louis was gentle. And Bert 
has taken to resting on the seventh day. Everybody has an Achilles' heel. 

Among Kersey's other failings is that he's brought fun to the arcane 
art of writing software. Generally, program authoring is conducted 
under circumstances that make the British stiff upper lip appear emo- 
tional by comparison. In those circles, mild amusement is considered un- 
toward raucousness. But Kersey has fun. In fact, he has so much fun that 
he can't seem to contain it. It seeps into his programs, scrambles into his 
advertising, and positively floods into his manuals. 

There is no course in reputable computer science curricula centering 
on the concept of fun in programming. It's neither efficient nor profit- 
able. Got that, Bert (Sophie)? But Beagle Bros seems to be surviving de- 
spite Kersey's lassitude on the Sabbath and his frivolous ways. 

Put in other contexts, seven out of ten ain't all that bad. Try to 
imagine a .700 hitter in baseball. Fans go gaga at the thought of a .400 
hitter. Politicians would love to be on the long side of those odds. They 
call 56 percent a landslide. What term would they conjure to describe 70 
percent? 

Five in the Top Thirty is fairly respectable also. No author has five 
books among the top-selling book charts. While George Lucas and 
Steven Spielberg are working on each having five of the top thirty movies 
of all time, they will have achieved that without having them released 
concurrently. Most things, including the creative urges, tend to be more 
successful when conducted in serial fashion rather than in parallel. 

Just think what would happen if Kersey could shake off the 
onslaught of old age. 

With Kersey strutting his stuff, there wasn't much room in the 



Hobby 10, but one new program cropped up. Copy II Plus, which has 
been hovering on the outskirts of the Hobby 10 for some time, finally 
scored. Apple Pascal retained a second non-Kersey slot. The team of 
Jochumson, Lubar, and Pelczarski — can you imagine those names sten- 
ciled in gold on the door of a law office — got the bottom rung with 
Graphics Magician.

Overall, business remained more solid than usual for midsummer 
and there were few noticeable deviations from recent trends. 

Apple Writer He continues to dominate the market and the Top 
Thirty. VisiCalc seems to be regaining strength and pulled slightly away 
from Multiplan while recapturing the second position. PFS.File remains 
strong in third. Zaxxon is clearly the entertainment choice of the sum- 
mer, as it led the games for the second straight month, but a challenge is 
looming. 

Broderbund's 150-level Lode Runner moved strongly in its initial 
month and may be another in that company's series of long-runners. 
Also gaining strength is Hard Hat Mack from Electronic Arts. 

Generally, the shakeup of the Top Thirty was of significantly less 
than momentous proportions. Computer SA T from Harcourt Brace Jo- 
vanovich hit the Top Thirty for the first time. Another old-timer scoring 
well was Knight of Diamonds, perhaps representing the mounting frus- 
tration level as Wizardry's third scenario failed to ship. 

Home Accountant continued to dominate the Home 10 list. ASCH 
Express:The Professional seems to have become the latest semiperma- 
nent bridesmaid. Micro Cookbook from Virtual Combinatics showed 
strength, jumping to fourth and breaking the virtual lock that communi- 
cations packages have had on all but the top spot in this category. 

VisiCalc regained its accustomed spot atop the Business 10. The In- 
credible Jack inched slightly higher and the new version of DB Master 
has resuscitated its fortunes. 

Multiplan stayed within striking distance of VisiCalc, but the pioneer 
showed it'll be tough for anyone to overcome its strong position in the 
Apple market.

colors to help children develop reading 



readiness sKills. Children ages 5 to 
12 can learn to play melodies with Early 
Games Music Our Piece of Cake turns 
math problems into, well, a piece of 
caKe. And Fraction Factory takes the 
work out of fractions. 

Early Games feature multiple 
activities, easy to use picture menus, 
and colorful graphics. The games 
are fun, children love to play themlThafs 
why they learn from them.

Knight of Diamonds jumped past Ultima II into second behind Wiz- 
ardry in the Fantasy 5 category. Missing Ring nabbed fourth and Ultima 
staggered home fifth. 

Castle Wolfenstein continued leading the Strategy 5, with Flight Sim- 
ulator and Sargon II trailing. Strategic Simulations nabbed the other two 
positions. Cosmic Balance II remained on the list, while North Atlantic 
'86 debuted on the chart. 

Zork I topped the Adventure 5 list. The biggest change was the pres- 
ence of Death in the Caribbean from Micro Fun, a company that's be- 
ginning to flex its muscles now that it has a certified hit like Miner 2049er 
under its belt. 

The Home Education 10 area remains a bulwark of sales strength. 
This was perhaps the only area that slowed down in July, but there was 
no drought at Spinnaker, whose //; Search of the Most Amazing Thing 
made its first appearance on the list. MasterType continues as the domi- 
nant entry, but Spinnaker captured the bottom five places and the next two 
spots were also carried by their products. 

Word processing seems to be the most popular application. As more 
word processors enter the fray, they seem to broaden the market, rather 
than taking sales from other products. Apple Writer lie remains the un- 
disputed leader, with Bank Street Writer a clear second. 

WordStar IS coming on strong with their new promotion that bundles 
a CP/M card with the program. And two absolutely new programs 
muscled their way onto the list. MegaWriter grabbed eighth and Word 
Juggler He scored tenth.

In addition to Lode Runner, there were some other bright spots on 
the Arcade 10. Stellar 7 made a big impression in its first month in dis- 
tribution and tied Frogger for sixth. Axis Assassin held strong. And the 
long-awaited Sammy Lightfoot finally arrived from Sierra On-Line to 
early applause. 

But Zaxxon is still the pacesetter by a wide margin. Miner 2()49er 
dropped to third with the arrival of Lode Runner. Choplifter and Frogger 
continue selling well.

Softalk Presents Hie Bestsellers 



Apple Writer III topped Apple III sales for the second month, lead- 
ing to the spectacle of Apple, a company as notorious for its mediocre 
software as Kersey is for his fun software, being the leading software 
publisher in both its markets. Of cowi^, Apple Writer is the brainchild of 
independent Paul Lutus, rather than of a committee process. Perhaps its 
success will serve as a model for hardware companies with software 
aspirations. 

VisiCorp's VisiC ale: Advanced Version remains second, with PFS.File 
and Report next. 

The fact that Apple Writer and VisiCalc run one-two on both Apple 



Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 6.7 percent of all sales of 
Apple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in August to ascertain their sales for the month of 
July. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold — such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and personal prefer- 
ences of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in August represented every geographical area of the continental 
United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index 
number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an 
arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are cor- 
relative only to the month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an in- 
dex rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in 
another month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 3.J6 percent, which translates roughly 
into the theoretical possibility of a change of 3.71 points, plus or minus, in any index 
number.
