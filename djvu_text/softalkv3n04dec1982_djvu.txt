CONTEST: 

ORACLE 83 



You've all been waiting for it, and it's final- 
ly here — the monster contest to end all monster 
contests (for 1982, anyway). Yep, it's Oracle 
'83, the contest that awards six prizes through- 
out the year and one biggie at the beginning of 
1984. But best of all, the grand prize winner will 
be named the Softalk Oracle of 1983, a title 
coveted by 16K and 128K users alike. 

Whether you're a Basic bungler or a ma- 
chine language maestro makes no difference — 
everyone has an equal chance at doing well or 
bombing. 

For you newcomers in the gallery who don't 
know what's going on, sit back down and read 
the rules. 

Rules: None. 

There are no rules; they're too confining. 
Just look at what we want you to predict and do 
the best you can. Point values are listed to help 
you decide how much time to spend working on 
each one. 

List your predictions on a sheet of paper 
and send them in to us postmarked before mid- 
night of December 31, 1982. No exceptions! 
Don't forget to include your name, address, 
phone number, the name of your dealer, and 
your signature. 

Prizes: Should you hit any of the predic- 
tions on the nose or come closer than anyone 
else, a good feeling of success should be enough. 
But, in case it isn't, we're going to award $100 
worth of products made by Softalk advertisers 
to the winner of each part. Keep your eyes 
glued to these pages for announcements of 
winners. 

The person who winds up the year with the 
highest cumulative score will win the "biggie" 
we mentioned earlier: Apple's next personal 
model computer. Not a II, not a III, but Ap- 
ple's next personal computer, whatever it is, 
brand spanking new! 

In addition to the prizes, you'll have brag- 
ging rights in all Appledom as the Softalk Ora- 
cle of 1983. So get going and have a blast! 
The Oracle '83. Predict the following: 

1 . The day and month Apple will officially 
announce the release of a new personal model 
Apple computer, or predict that they won't. In 
case they should release more than one new 
model in 1983, only the first one counts. -1 
point for every day off the mark; -365 if they 
announce one and you said they wouldn't 
(watch yourself). 



2. The teams to make the Final Four in the 
NCAA Basketball Tournament. +5 points for 
each team; —5 for each wrong guess. -1-10 
bonus points if you predict the winner of the 
tournament. 

3. Who will win the Academy Awards in the 
categories of best actor, actress, and picture. 
-I- 10 points for each; -1-20 bonus points for get- 
ting all three correct. 

4. The sex, region of origin (East, Midwest, 
West, South, Foreign), and winning time of the 
winner of the Kentucky Derby. -I- 1 point for a 
colt, -1-20 points .if it's a filly, —10 points if you 
blow it; -1-5 points for region; -1 point for ev- 
ery 1/5-second off the time; -1-25 bonus points 
for naming the horse; -1-15 bonus points for 
naming the jockey (whew!). 

5. Flags fly high on the Fourth of July. Peo- 
ple and temperatures get high then, too. What 
do you predict the high temperature will be in 
San Jose, California, on July 4, 1983? -1 point 
for each degree Fahrenheit off the mark. 

6. The earliest presidential candidacy decla- 
rations for Republican and Democratic parties 
made by September 30, 1983. -1-10 points per 
valid declarer; —5 points for everyone you name 
who doesn't declare by then. 

7. The five companies that will appear most 
frequently in Softalk's Top Thirty throughout 
1983. +5 points per company; -1-20 bonus 
points for guessing the correct number of ap- 
f)earances of the top company.

CONTINENTAL'S 
HOME ACCOUNTANT IS NUMBER ONE- 

AND CUMBING 



For the past several months, Softalk magazine has 
rated Continental Software's Home Accountant™ 
No. 1 in its "Home 10" best-seller list. 

A lot of programs would have "peaked" by 
now. But with over 10,000 copies in use, Home 
Accountant just keeps getting stronger. 

There's a reason for this spectacular suc- 
cess — and it's not just the low suggested price 
of $74.95. 

The fact is. Home Accountant is one of those 
rare programs that virtually everybody can profit 
I from using. It's powerful enough to handle even 
the most complicated family budget — yet it's so 



easy to use that one quick trip through the manual 
may be ail you'll ever need. 

With Home Accountant you can track up to 
100 budget categories, 5 different checking ac- 
counts, and all the credit cards you can carry. Just 
press a few keys and watch the program print your 
checks, net worth and other financial statements. 
And when you see the full-color graphs of actual vs. 
budgeted expenses, trend line analyses, etc., you'll 
know you bought the best. 

See your Apple dealer soon for a demonstra- 
tion. And start watching your fortunes climb with 
Home Accountant

Oracle Scores a 
Shaped Quotes^ ihd Stuff 



No-Hitter? No Can Do. "The date of the 
first no-hitter in the 1982 Major League base- 
ball season" was what Oracle contestants had 
to predict in part three of this year-long con- 
test. Aw, that's simple; find the worst-hitting 
team and the day they're scheduled to face the 
team with the best pitching staff and you have 
yourself $100 in goodies. It's not that simple. In 
predicting the first no-hitter, you'd probably 
have had just as much luck if you'd guessed. 

Your chances would have been better if 
you'd predicted that there wouldn't be a no-hit- 
ter at all and hoped for the best. That's what 
forty of our contestants did — and they were 
right. 



Of those who correctly predicted that ma- 
jor league pitchers would deliver a mediocre 
season, the RNG yanked out C. Engler of Nut- 
ley, New Jersey, as the winner. Engler will soon 
have a ventilated Apple, as she plans to pick up 
a Cool Stack from FMJ as her prize. 

Next month, we'll see who most accurately 
predicted the breakdown in the United States 
Congress after the November elections. 

That's a Quote. The Famous Apples in His- 
tory contest that ran in June is finally over, and 
Susan C. West of Coolville, Ohio, is our win- 
ner. Her entry. The Rave In (#10 in the Septem- 
ber finals and one of two citing Edgar Allan 
Poe's The Raven), was voted as the readers' fa-

vorite in the Quotes contest, earning it a spot in 
the So/talk Museum. 

Strangely enough. West didn't even send in 
a vote for herself. "I really didn't think I'd win. 
So, I read all twelve entries to my husband and 
my sister; they told me they thought mine was 
the best." It was West's husband David who 
cast a ballot for the West household. 

Collecting her prize will be an adventure for 
West. Coolville (population 500) is not exactly a 
metropolitan area. Her computer dealer is Mi- 
cro Center in Columbus, a good two-hour drive 
away. But for West, visiting Micro Center is a 
regular trip. "We usually carpool down there 
and make a day of it." 

Only one History finalist sent in a vote (you 
know who you are); the rest of you can't com- 
plain since you didn't vote for yourselves. 

Naming all the famous people being quoted 
was another matter. Of all the ballots we re- 
ceived, only four persons correctly identified the 
sources of the quotes. The random number gen- 
erator randomly generated Bryant D. Blansit of 
Augusta, Georgia, as the winner. For his liter- 
ary proficiency, Blansit will go down to Micro- 
Graphics Systems in Augusta where he'll re- 
ceive $50 worth of stuff for his Apple. 

By the way, Blansit voted for finalist #4, the 
other Raven. 

Nobody would have won if it weren't for all 
the nice people who took the time to send in 
their votes. And of all those nice people, the 
random number generator worked overtime

Somewhere on each floor of the Soviet diplomatic mission in 
Pyongyang are the nine parts of an encoded message. Your 
future is assured if you can just find those pieces and put 
them together, and then solve the puzzle. But to do so you 
must avoid the embassy guards who make frequent rounds at 
unscheduled intervals. They don't ask questions first, either. 





You got a late start looking for that summer job, and all you 
could find was a baker apprentice position at the Automated 
Bakery Company. Simple enough, since the pies are made 
by machine ... all you have to do is add topping and put 
the pies away when they come out on the conveyor belt. 
Shouldn't be too difficult of a summer, you think to 
yourself . . .

MICROBUFFER WILL 
SPEED UP ANY PROGRAM 
THAT REQUIRES PRINTING. 



MICROBUFFER ALLOWS YOU 
10 PRINT AND PROCESS 
SIMULTANEOUSLY 

Now you don't have to wait for 
the printer to finish before you 
can use your computer again. 

YOU CAN DUMP 
PRINTING DATA DIRECTLY 
TO MICROBUFFER. 

Unlike your printer, Microbuffer 
accepts data as fast as your 
computer can send it. So there's 
never a bottleneck. 

Microbuffer first stores the 
data in its own memory buffer 
and then takes control of your 
printer. This frees the computer 
for more productive functions. 

Additional output may be 
dumped to the buffer at any 
time and it will be printed in 
turn. 

THERE IS A MICROBUFFER 
FOR ANY PRINTER/COMPUTER 
COMBINATION. 

Microbuffers are available in 
Centronics-compatible parallel 
or RS-232C serial versions. 

FOR APPLE II COMPUTERS, 
Microbuffer II features on-board 



firmware for text formatting and 
advanced graphics dump 
routines. Both serial and parallel 
versions have very low power 
consumption. Special functions 
include Basic listing formatter, 
self-test, buffer zap, and 
transparent and maintain modes. 
The 16K model is priced at $259 
and the 32K, at $299. 

FOR EPSON PRINTERS, Microbuffer 
is $159 in either an 8K serial or a 
16K parallel version. The serial 
buffer supports both hardware 
handshaking and XON-XOFF 
software handshaking at baud 
rates up to 19,200. Both Epson 
interfaces are compatible with all 
Epson commands 
including GRAFTRAX-80 and 
GRAFTRAX-80 + 

ALL OTHER PRINTER/COMPUTER 
COMBINATIONS are served by the 
in-line, stand-alone Microbuffers. 
Both serial and parallel versions 
are expandable up to 256K. The 
serial stand-alone will support 
different input and output baud 
rates and handshake protocol. 
The 32K model starts at $299, 
64K for $349. 64K add-ons for up 
to a total of 256K are just $179. 

When you think of how much 
time Microbuffer will save, 
can you afford to not have one? 



SIMPLE TO INSTALL. 

Microbuffer II is slot-independent. 
It will fit directly inside the Apple 
II in any slot except zero. 

Microbuffer for your Epson 
mounts easily in the existing 
auxiliary slot directly inside the 
printer. 

The stand-alone Microbuffer is 
installed in-line between virtually 
any printer and computer. 

MICROBUFFER FROM 
PRACTICAL PERIPHERALS. 

Practical Peripherals is dedicated 
to establishing new industry 
standards for product performance. 

The un-retouched photo at left 
has been enlarged to demostrate 
Microbuffer's exact workmanship 
and precise attention to detail. 
Specifications demand that each 
board undergo 36 seperate tests 
and inspections before it can 
leave the factory.

tion of the most practical, most 
successful new product of the 
year — Microbuffer.

mark and another for having misspelled Sof- 
talk three times. So, we managed to narrow the 
field by two. 

The winner is John M. Morrison of Phila- 
delphia, Pennsylvania, who missed only six of 
the possible ninety-two shapes. Morrison's en- 
try looked like a cross between the Shapes and 
Oracle contests, because he seemed to know he 
was destined to win. "Okay!" wrote Morrison. 
"Here's a winner for the 'Name the Shapes' 
contest." 

Such an accurate prediction doesn't win him 
anything in the Oracle contest, but in the 
Shapes contest it does earn him $100 worth of 
stocking stuffers (most probably his own stock- 
ing). John plans to splurge with it on the Ar- 
cade Machine and either Sheila, Galactic Gladi- 
ators, or Prisoner 2. 

Most of the shapes were pretty easy (we 
wanted you all to feel real smart). If you al- 
ready peeked at the answers and are crying, 
"Hey, no fair! I didn't know you wanted us to 
be that specific," rest assured, we gave every- 
one the benefit of the doubt where it was close. 

Perhaps the trickiest ones were shapes #13 
and #88. Only a handful of contestants were 
able to identify the omithopter and island of 
Crete, respectively. But we did get some inter- 
esting answers (wild guesses) from desperate en- 
trants. To some, the omithopter looked like one 
of the following: city skyline, Medfly, squashed 
Apple computer, Chinese junk, dead horse, fly 
on a fly swatter, plane from Cropduster, ab- 
stract nothingness, Lego blocks, and "beats the

H out of me." 

Here are some last-ditch guesses for Crete: 
the floor after Rumpelstiltskin's name was 
guessed by the queen, God only knows. Statue 
of Liberty, rubber chicken, Loch Ness, dead 
bodies, Cuba, Israel, Ronald Reagan, foot meas 
uring tool, ©!?*#%$!, and Smurf action. But 
the most elaborate guess came from Mark 
Seybold (WestCovina, CA). Seybold said shape 
#88 was, 

"The fabled, long-lost island of Idunnowu- 
titis, that sunk in the early 15000s B.C. before 
anybody had a chance to see what it looked like 
(except myself, who acquired the map of it from 
a descendant of one of the natives)." 

Okay, enough general observation; let's 
award some nonprizes. 

Good Catch. Joe Schwartz (Andover, NJ) 
was quick to point out that the computer punch 
card (#74) had the holes going the wrong way. 
And golly, he was right. 

Schwartz isn't the only one with keen eyes. 
Jesse Spears (Azle, TX) noticed that the French 
horn (#73) had no mouthpiece and Randy Mita 
(Palos Verdes Estates, CA) was the only person 
to specify the film (#67) correctly as 70mm. 

Those swinging ball bearings (#38) received 
as many different guesses as there were contes- 
tants. But Sean Walter (Kansas City, MO) 
called them "a series of pendulums used to 
show action and reaction. My grandparents 
have one, but I don't know the name of it. You 
can caU them at (816) 555-0656." Well, we 
called collect (we said our name was "Sean"), 
and now Sean's grandparents have written him 
off their Christmas list. 

Watch it, Lou "Cyclops" Sebok (Lorain, 
OH). You're apt to poke your eye out! Lou 
thought the hexagon (#2) was "a pencil, as seen 
looking from the point to the eraser." 

We don't know why, but B. L. Sims (South 
Charleston, WV) used VisiCalc to format his 
entry. We assume that he purchased the pro- 
gram just to enter the contest, making his entry 
the most expensive Softalk contest entry in 
history. 

The above-mentioned contestants would 
have won the coveted InvisiTabs, but we can't 
find any; they seem to have disappeared. Sorry. 

But enough of this jocularity — let's move on 
to some contest losers. 

Dropped Balls. The United Nations 
building (#62) seemed to confuse a lot of peo- 
ple. Patricia Hyland" (Fayetteville, NC) and 
Darell Smith (Colorado Springs, CO) thought it 
looked like a breakfast setting with a box of 
cereal. 

The Guggenheim Museum in New York 
City (#29) was mistaken by Kathie Roe (Wood- 
bine, MD) to be Apple Computer Head- 
quarters. Don't feel so bad, Kathie; Matt Bate- 
man (Central Point, OR) thought it was Willy 
Wonka's Chocolate Factory. 

But the nonprize in the cat^ory of Honesty 
at the Risk of Embarrassing Oneself goes to 
Judy Webb (Iowa Park, TX), who wrote, "I got 
the encyclopedia down and looked up Madi- 
son Square Garden, hoping it would be one of 
the buildings. It isn't. I don't travel much to the 



West Coast. ... I believe they must come from 
there." That's very inductive, Judy. Come on 
out to California, and we'll show you where 
those buildings aren't. 

Robert Huggins (Raleigh, NC) found a new 
way to spell "candelabra." C-A-N-D-L-E O-P- 
E-R-A. Larry Tentor (Schenectady, NY) 
couldn't spell "Rorschach," but he gave it an 
honest try. R-OS-T-O-P-C-H-I-N. And Jona- 
than Scott (Myrtle Beach, SC) visited Florence, 
Italy, to see the statue of David (#51) by 
Donatello. 

Did everybody get the Jefferson Memorial 
(#65)? Ken Hayden (Carpentersville, IL) en- 
tered, "Lincoln Memorial (seen from the side 
. . . sneaky!)." Ken also sneaked in a whole 
bunch of other wrong answers. 

Henry Hsich (Erie, PA) looked at shape #40 
and entered, "A jar of ink or nose drops." We 
gave you credit for the ink, Henry. Just don't 
get them mixed up the next time you're con- 
gested. 

New Jersey (#5) isn't as prominait a state as 
its residents would like to believe. Warren Zane 
(Honolulu, HI) said it was Alaska, and Henry 
Schneider (San Rafael, CA) called it an inkblot. 

Eric Wade (Jamez Springs, NM), if you had 
won, you would have won only $99.01 worth of 
goods instead of the usual $100 worth. Your en- 
try arrived with nine cents postage due. 

"I think I would like to have: Accu-Shapes, 
Higher Graphics, and Marauder, or a combina- 
tion thereof," wrote Rick Anderson (Milwau- 
kee, OR). "But don't quote me until I've lost!" 
Consider yourself quoted. Rick. 

Poor Sirius Software. Although most peo- 
ple recognized Sirius's Grud (#54), other guesses 
included Dumbo the Elephant, Topo Gigio 
(from the Ed Sullivan Show), and E.T. But the 
most daring contestant of all was Jeff "So sue 
me" Neyhart (Kingston, NY), who had the au- 
dacity to identify the Grud as "the -man from 
Broderbund's ads." Attorneys for either com- 
pany can find Jeff (probably the only TRS-80 
user subscribing to Softalk) on Saturdays root- 
ing for his favorite college football team, the 
University of Michigjin Buckeyes. 

In case you're stilP Wondering what the heck 
those shapes were, here are the answers: 

1. tire iron or lug wrench 

2. a hexagon (not a Rubik's cube!) 

3. can and bottle opener or church key 

4. wind-up alarm clock 

5. state of New Jersey 

6. digger from Apple Panic 

7. sinking ship Titanic 

8. cobra 

9. Coca-Cola bottle 

10. fleeing ghost from Pac-Man

ware's Apventure to Atlantis

It's Raining Apples 

It keeps getting weirder and weirder around here. The things that happen at Softalk make 
the house in Poltergeist look like Disneyland. For example, the other day, an Apple comput- 
er came crashing through the ceiling with a small plastic bag and a note attached. 

In the bag was a gnat mumbling something about his job in the Silicon Valley. The note 
read as follows: 

"You humans really surprise us Bezardians. It seems your readers are still having trouble 
with the game part of the Contest That's Out of This World in the October Softalk. What's 
the matter, not enough incentive? We order you to extend the deadline and to offer this 6502 
device as a new prize." 

They're serious, folks. So, what we'll do is extend the deadline for the game part of the 
contest — that's where you have to translate the manual and screens of SDS's 
<^6?J?^9 — to January 15, 1983. That'll give you lots of time to help save the Silicon 
Valley from turning into a gnat farm. But the big news is that the prize for winning this con- 
test is no longer a $100 gift certificate, but a brand-new Apple II Plus courtesy of Southwest- 
ern Data Systems! 

So boot up the game, break out that Bezardian decoder ring, and win yourself a shiny 
new Apple II Plus. Send your entries in by January 15, 1983, to Softalk Aliens, Box 60, 
North Hollywood, CA 91603. 

This just in off the Softalk wires: The Bezardians were last spotted (gnat converters and 
all) cruising down Bandley Drive.

Spinnater presents 
Delta Drawing. 




An introduction to the 
modern art of programming 
using the ancient art 
of drawing. 



Splnnaher Software Corp , 1982 



Kids love to draw. 

And with Delta Drawing, your children 
can have fun creating their own colorful 
drawings, and at the same time, learn 
about computer programming. 

Delta Drawing is much more than 
just a fun game. Ifs an educational 
tool that helps children develop their 
creativity, learn to write computer pro- 
grams and 
build an 
understand- 
ing of pro- 
cedural 
thinking. 





Easier to use than L0(50. 

Delta Drawing makes 
it easy for children to 
use the computer-even 
if they've never used a 
computer before. 

In fact ifs easier to use than LOGO 
turtle graphics. And Delta Drawing costs 
less than half as much as LOGO. 

With Delta Drawing, your child controls 
the Delta cursor, and the Delta cursor 
controls all the action. 5o Kids can learn 
at their own pace while they're having fun. 
How your children will learn 
programming. 

With Delta Drawing, your child first 
creates a picture using simple, single- 
key commands, for example: "D" for 
draw, "L" for left "E" for erase. 

As the picture is being drawn, the com- 
puter keeps track of every keystroke 
and records it as a program. 

Then, by touching the "T" key for "text 
mode," the child can see the program 



that was written. As children progress, 
they can begin to write their programs 
in the text mode and switch to the graph- 
ics mode to see their pictures. They can 
even switch back and forth 
between graphics and 
text modes. 

Delta Drawing will 
make your child comfort- 
able with the computer 
and helps develop proce- 
dural thinking-the kind 
of step-by-step approach 
needed to write programs 
and solve problems 
with computers. 
Get Delta Drawing today. 

Delta Drawing can be played on Apple,® 
IBM® and Atari® computers. 

It comes complete with easy-to- 
follow fast-start cards. And for more

lb Do It Right 

To make a Winchester disk for just Apple®II. 



That's how we set out to design our hard disk for 
the Apple®II. To understand the needs of serious 
users and programmers, and to correct the errors 
of our predecessors. 

You want user-friendliness. So we wrote hard disk 
versions of Apple DOS, CP/M® and Pascal that 
are highly user-friendly and loaded with 
useful features. 

□ Auto-boot hard disk 

□ Menu-driven utilities 

□ Single-keystroke program execution in DOS 

□ Disk search with wild cards, and many more 

You want flexibility. So we made every 
feature variable. 

□ From 1 to 16 operating systems on each disk 

□ Operating system spaces grow as needed 

□ Slot independence 

□ Variable size volumes (to 400K in DOS) 

□ Mountable and unmountable volumes (even in CP/M) 

□ Custom DOS allowed 

You want reliability. We use Seagate drives only. 
And Corona's unique data protection technology. 

□ DataGuard™ 32-bit error correction code 

□ FailSafe™ read-after-write and automatic bad-sector reallocation 

□ 2-level impact-protection packaging 



You want low-cost backup. So we wrote backup 
utilities that make floppy backup convenient. 

□ File compacting to reduce the number of floppies 

□ Volume selective backup in all operating systems 

□ Date selective backup in Pascal 

□ Automatic diskette sequencing to ease floppy handling 

You want compatibility. We maximize compati- 
bility with existing software and peripheral cards. 

□ 9K interface card leaves main memory untouched 

□ Interrupts are allowed 

□ Boot protected floppies from slot 6 without removing hard disk 

□ Automatic slot/drive to hard disk remapping 

And you want support. We do that right too. 

□ Hardware depot service in every region 

□ Programmer's guides at each level 

□ Software theft-protection on the hard disk 

Compare the features that matter to you. 
And visit our local dealer or distributor for 
a demonstration. You'll see the difference 
specialization makes.

Fastalk is your quick guide to popular, special- 
ized, or classic software. Programs appearing in Fas- 
talk must meet one or more of the following criteria: 
(1) equal or surpass in sales the least-selling program 
to appear on any of the current bestseller lists; (2) re- 
late to a specialized subject area and be in general dis- 
tribution (more specialized packages and areas will be 
included as Fastalk matures); (3) be new and of pro- 
fessional quality (sUch programs will be carried for 
one month only — after that, they must meet other cri- 
teria for inclusion); (4) stand out as extraordinary. 

Designation as a classic is noted by a bullet pre- 
ceding a program's title. 

Where opinion is expressed, Softalk has seen the 
software in question; the date of Soflalk's review, if 
any, is given at the end of the item. 

Softalk may arbitrarily omit any package from 
Fastalk, whether or not it meets the foregoing criteria.

CHOOSE THE LESSONS THAT FIT 
YOUR CHILD'S NEEDS. 

• Basic Number 
Facts: lets your child 
practice basic num- 
bers, including addi- 
tion without carrying, 
subtraction without 
borrowing and multi- 
plication/division 
with single digits. Kids 
race against time to 
build up their speed 
in these math areas. Designed for elementary 
school age, or any child "who needs practice 
with basic iniiole number operations. 

• Whole Numbers: simulates a pinball game 
to hold and build interest in whole number 
operations. Problems include addition, sub- 
traction, multiplication, division and mixed 
numbers. Designed for elementary and 
junior high age groups. 

• Decimals: kids are challenged to break 
balloons by entering the correct decimal 
corresponding to the position of the balloon 
on a vertical line. Numbers are entered on a 
trial-and-error basis. Software automatically 
adjusts difficulty to the child's performance. 
For elementary math students. 

• Fractions: same format as Decimals, but 
requires the use of fractions to break the 
balloons. Numbers are entered on a trial- 
and-error basis. Balloons may burst in any 
order until none are left Difficulty adjusts 
to your child's performance. For elementary 
math students. 



• Computer Literacy— Introduction: this 
lesson is presented in a friendly, non-intimi- 
dating manner with touches of humor and 
simple, supportive graphics. It presents the 
history and uses of computers in today's 
society. Designed for junior or senior high

Discussion 




Santa's Pixels Work Overtime 

Reader Harry Vertelney of Eclectic Electric in Palo Alto, California, used an Apple II Plus, 
Apple Graphics Tablet, and Designer's Toolkit from Special Delivery Software in creating this 
hi-res holiday greeting to cheer the spirits of fellow Softalk readers. 



Open Discussion gives you the chance to air your \iews 
and concerns, to seek answers to questions, to offer so- 
lutions or helpful suggestions, and to develop a rapport 
with other readers. It's what you make it, so share your 
thoughts, typed or printed, and double-spaced (please), 
in Softalk'j Open Discussion. Box 60, North Holly- 
wood. CA 91603. To ensure the inclusion of as many 
contributions as possible, letters may be condensed and 
edited. 

Media for Your Computerette 

I am finding it puzzling that so many authors of 
personal computer user documentation find it 
necessary to refer to the program disks as disk- 
ettes. I suspect this is not a word that the au- 
thors are comfortable using; in most of the 
manuals I have seen they forget to use the long- 
er word and begin referring to the disk as a disk. 
I realize that disks come in many sizes, but that 
does not seem to warrant using two different 
words to describe them. In fact, I can't imagine 
a situation in which a user would not know 
which disk was being referred to. 

If someone can convince me that there is a 
compelling reason to distinguish between sizes 
of disks by calling one a disk and one a disk- 
ette, I am willing to accept the two different 
words. But I am going to have some difficulty in 
using my diskettes. I don't have a diskette drive. 
Carol J. Manley, Issaquah, WA 



Going, Going, Gosub 

I have been reading Softalk for a long time 
now and I just realized that I've missed many 
fine articles in the magazine because of a pro- 
gramming error in your editorial policy. 

When an article is to be continued else- 
where in the magazine the command "Goto 
page such and such" is used. When I do that, 
everything is so interesting, even the ads, that I 
just keep on going. If you used, instead, the 
command "Gosub page such and such" and 
when the article finished used the command 
"Return to page such and such," I could get to 
read all the neat stuff you print! 

Also, please tell Roger Wagner that his new 
Southwestern Data Systems program with the 
strange characters is the most exciting thing I've 
seen in Softalk since those hot tub ads. It just 
proves that learning assembly language has 
strange side effects indeed! 
Paul Raymer, Las Vegas, NV 

Go with the Pros 

I'm writing about a subject that I'm sure will be 
familiar to many Softalk readers. It has to do 
with purchasing your first computer system and 
some of the unnerving experiences that can ac- 
company this venture. 

The first place I went shopping to was one 



of those fancy downtown places where all the 
salesmen wear fancy three-piece vested suits. A 
young man approached me with the original 
opener, "Are you interested in buying a com- 
puter?" A very direct approach indeed. When I 
talked technically, he immediately backed off, 
saying that he was "just a salesman." When I 
got into the subject of cost, he got downright 
cavalier. He informed me that if price was an 
important factor in choosing my Apple II con- 
figuration, then I was in the wrong place. How- 
ever, he said, "Feel free to look around," and he 
left me so that he could approach another pros- 
pect. Isn't independence wonderful when you're 
in business? 

My next stop took me to a place that was 
very price-competitive. I got an excellent quote. 
I asked the salesman to check out the system, 
using the word processor that came with it. 
(There is often incompatibility between word 
processors and certain printers.) I wanted to 
avoid this. I went to pick up my system with a 
certified check for $3,000. The system had never 
been checked out and the company refused to 
do so. They told me that when someone pur- 
chased a system from them, it was the custom- 
er's problem to make the interface work. I 
walked out with my $3,000. 

Next I called the Comm Center in Laurel, 
Maryland. They had previously quoted a price 
that was only slightly higher than the one at the 
place that I had just left. Jerry Johnson, the 
manager, said that he would demonstrate my 
configuration. He said that the Comm Center 
had a policy not to sell a system without first 
checking it out. A half hour later, Jerry had the 
system configured and was demonstrating it to 
me. My fears were confirmed — there was an in- 
terface problem. Jerry Johnson stayed with me 
after hours patching DOS to finally get the sys- 
tem to work successfully. He also discovered a 
bug in the software that he reported to the com- 
pany in California. Here is an example of a true 
computer professional marketing a system hon- 
estly, as opposed to a nonprofessional who 
knows very little about computers and couldn't 
care less about your successful implementation 
of the system. 

Barry H. Gross, Potomac, MD 
VisiFriend 

I enjoy Open Discussion very much and I feel it 
is very helpful to read users' comments about 
their software experiences. As Apple software 
can run upward of $250 per program, the pur- 
chase of problem software can be quite de- 
pressing. Instead of telling of my software woes, 
I'd like to comment on what I consider to be my 
best purchase — VisiFile. To my recollection, 
VisiFile has received little ink in this column, 
and since it is such a good database, I feel it de- 
serves some recognition. 

Foremost, the program is extremely user- 
friendly. The documentation is straightfor- 
ward, readable, and complete. Two disk drives 
are quite adequate for fast, efficient operation 
(48K and sixteen sector are required). The pro- 
gram is written in Applesoft and is modifiable 
to a degree, as each disk is quite full. It uses

DOS 3.3, so it's easy to utilize data files in cus- 
tom programs. 

Although VisiFile's report/label printing 
abilities are nothing short of terrific, I have 
found the need to write my own printing rou- 
tines to meet some of my quite specialized 
needs. The coauthor of the program, Colin 
Jameson, has been extremely helpful in this re- 
gard. He runs a VisiFile user group, publishes a 
newsletter, maintains a user hotline, and 
has been exceedingly helpful and responsive to 
my rookie programming questions. 

Since I have had no problems with the pro- 
gram, I can't say very much about VisiCorp's 
customer support. I can say, though, that they 
provided a free set of backup disks and re- 
quired only a $20 fee for the updated version 
that included two disks and a new manual. 
VisiFile really is a good program.

Encore! Encore! 

It has been exactly twenty-four hours since I 
received my copy of SubLogic's Night Mission 
Pinball by Bruce Artwick. I have been left 
speechless. I brought it over to show a friend of 
mine who is a physicist at Bell Labs. His reac- 
tion was slightly more verbal "What a fox-piece 
of programming!" I nodded my head in mute 
agreement while trying to keep three balls in 
play during "Cosmic Mode." All in all, this is 
truly a virtuoso piece of programming. Bravo, 
Mr. Artwick, bravo!

Saturn Express 

I would like to report some exceptional sup- 
port from Saturn Systems. I have one of their 
32K RAM boards. It developed a bad memory 
chip after several months of usage. I very much 
needed the board for the operation of a VisiCalc 
program that I have developed for a client and 
could not wait for the board to make a round 
trip to Saturn for repair. 

Advised of my difficulties, one of Saturn's 
technical support persons, Brian, sent me a 
copy of Saturn's memory test program for the 
32K board along with two replacement mem- 
ory chips. There was no charge, even though 
my board is secondhand and not technically 
covered by their warranty. Even more helpful, 
Brian personally delivered the package to the 
Federal Express ofiice at the airport on his way 
home so that I could get the replacement parts 
as soon as possible.

Tending the Relics 

When purchasing software by mail, the rule of 
caveat emptor often prevails. When the pur- 
chase is made from a small software company, 
it really takes a good deal of trust on the buy- 
er's part that the product will perform as stated 
in the ad. 

How refreshing it is to find a software com- 
pany that stands behind its product like RAM 
Enterprises. Their fantasy game. Relics of the 
Empire, had many bugs in it when it arrived at 
my Apple. I returned it, describing the bugs, 



and within a week the replacement copy ar- 
rived. Most of the bugs had been removed, but 
enough were left to detract from the game. 
Instead of replacing the disk this time, they sent 
a refund to all who had bought the game, and 
promised a free copy to take care of the ag- 
gravation and frustration of those who had 
spent hours trying to play the game! 

I wish the bigger software companies would 
take note, and instead of charging the customer 
for a replacement, send the new copy free of 
charge. 

Incidentally, the program bugs were due to 
copy-protection schemes, but that's another 
argument. Relics of the Empire has good con- 
cept and design. Once the bugs are disposed of, 
it should provide many hours of enjoyment. 
Michael Ahle, Carmichael, CA 

Exposure of Support 

I think Continental Software should be com- 
mended for their excellent customer support 
program, and Softalk for an excellent Apple 
support program. Programs such as Continen- 
tal's Home Accountant, Apple's Controller, Visi- 
Corp's VisiCalc, and HowardSoft's Tax Pre- 
parer make this newcomer to computing think 
that persona! computers and their software are 
the best thing to hit the beach since bikinis. 
Henry D. McAvoy, Rome, ME 



The Brunt of the Boot 

The problem of copy-protected software is 
seemingly endless, and the release of new hard- 
ware-based copiers proves that point. My par- 
ticular complaint is that the little guy is 
getting lost in the shuffle. As the owner of non- 
standard, higher-capacity disk drives for the 
Apple II, I really get burned. Most commer- 
cial-type software is DOS-guarded, which ef- 
fectively prevents my utilizing the added 15- 
plus percent disk space of my disk drives — 
especially critical on the standard 143K disk. 
What really burns me are the game manufac- 
turers. It is at the point where 90 percent of all 
game disks cannot be booted on nonhalf- 
track drives. 

The best example of copy-protected futility 
is Bandits, a recent excellent arcade-type game 
release. Sirius Software has achieved such an 
excellent protection scheme that even after buy- 
ing the disk (which would not boot), the disk 
drive manufacturer could not produce a boot- 
able full-track version. (They were nice enough 
to buy my copy, so I was not completely stuck.) 
Presently mail-order software dealers are sell- 
ing Bandits for about twenty dollars. Not worth 
the price of copying, yet out of my reach at 
any price. 

Considering the fact that the average disk 
game costs about two dollars to produce, and 
up to about ten dollars for a full-blown, highly 
advertised, arcade-type product, it would seem 
the small guy is getting shortchanged. I am 
caught in the middle. A new disk drive with 
controller to read half-track would cost about 
$300 to $600. Recent advertisements in my area 
listed used, full-sized arcade versions of Galaxian 



(the original Bandits-type) for $700! 

In closing, when will it stop being the little 
guy who foots the bill? I would have been 
willing to pay fifty dollars for a bootable ver- 
sion of Bandits (or Choplifter, or whatever), but 
instead I can enjoy none. Maybe it is time the 
users joined the National Football League and 
went on strike! 
Marc A. Ries, Whitder, CA 

Seven-Day Wonder 

Although I rarely write letters to magazines, I 
feel compelled to do so after two recent deal- 
ings with Sirius Software. 

I purchased Bandits from a local software 
store and quickly became addicted to the game. 
After approximately four weeks, the disk would 
not boot properly and I decided to take advan- 
tage of Sirius's replacement offer. I sent them a 
check and the disk, expecting a four to six 
week wait. 

Within one week I received a new copy of 
Bandits and they returned my check! That's ter- 
rific, but perhaps they found the disk defective 
and decided that I deserved a no-charge replace- 
ment. Along with the disk, they sent several full- 
color flyers advertising their software. One of 
these caught my eye. Gorgon, which I pur- 
chased almost a year ago, was now compatible 
with the joyport. I promptly sent my time-worn 
(but still perfectly functional) copy of Gorgon to 
Sirius, along with $39.95, for the newest ver- 
sion. Unbelievably, within ten days I received 
my same disk back with the new version of 
Gorgon recorded on it, and again — no charge! 

This is incredible customer support. As far 
as I'm concerned I'll purchase any Sirius Soft- 
ware product with total assurance that they will 
back it up. Sirius is definitely number one. 

While I'm on a roll I should also mention 
Penguin Software as another notable software 
supplier. I purchased their Graphics Magician 
program, and several weeks later I received a 
programming tutorial. It included helpful hints 
and a notice that the package had several revi- 
sions recently. I sent my $5 and the disk, and 
promptly received the latest version. Here is 
another example of excellent customer support. 
Mark A. Pelletier, Griffith, IN 

Honesty Confirmed, Games Protected 

Another opfen letter from Penguin Software to 
Apple users: 

Last February we announced that we were 
removing the copy protection from all our ap- 
plications software. We'd like to thank all of 
you for the excellent response and for making 
this policy successful. Although we were a little 
apprehensive about the possible consequences 
in the beginning, it's now apparent that we not 
only made a decision we feel good about, but 
we won't be going out of business either. Our 
trust in the basic honesty of most of you out 
there has been confirmed. 

In addition to our graphics utilities, we 
started publishing game software in September, 
and (gasp!) the games are copy-protected. 
We've talked to many of our customers over the 
phone and at shows, and so far they ail have

SOFTAI 1^

agreed that games really are in quite a different 
category and that they should be protected. (Al 
Tommervik grumbled a little, but he practices 
at being difficult.) 

Whereas with applications it is extremely 
useful (and recommended) to back up your 
disks, and nice to be able to access parts of the 
code, with games it is not as much of a trau- 
matic experience if a disk goes bad and one has 
to wait a week for a replacement. Perhaps it's 
the fact that documentation is not as necessary 
with games, or that the perceived value is less 
than that of utilities, but games do seem much 
more prone to casual copying and trading. 

We do guarantee our game disks for sixty 
days' free replacement if one fails, or $5 (ba- 
sically our cost) for replacement afterward. 
That seems fair. We're not out to make extra 
money on something that's already been pur- 
chased, but we do need to cover our costs. I'm 
sure that the experts out there can break our 
protection; we're not really into the game of 
"This nibble copier can or can't," or whatever. 
But we hope that you'll all act with the same 
honesty and integrity with our games as you 
have with our applications products. And we 
hope you enjoy them. 

Meanwhile, all our applications software, 
present and future, will definitely be on stan- 
dard, unprotected disks. We thank you for 
making it work! 
Mark Pelczarski, president.

An Unbeatable Equation 

I have always had the desire, and just recently 
the need, to connect my Apple II directly to a 
mainframe computer. In addition to the direct 
connect, I wanted to be able to capture and 
modify data files, print to my local printer, and 
have an eighty-column display on the monitor. 

At first I thought it couldn't be done. How- 
ever, after a few phone calls, I had the good for- 
tune of contacting SSM Microcomputer Prod- 
ucts. Not only did they say it could be done, but 
they said it would be easy. They were right! 

For the hardware, I purchased SSM's AIO- 

II interface card. This is a real neat interface 
that allows me to have a serial input from the 
mainframe and a parallel output to my printer. 
A Videoterm card, manufactured by Videx, 
solved the eighty-column display problem. 
Transend, a data communications package also 
supplied by SSM, tied the whole package 
together. Yes, I did have some initial problems, 
but they were solved by the excellent technical 
support of both SSM and Videx. 

Good products plus super support equals a 
more-than-satisfied user. 
Peter F. Poranski, Houston, TX 

Three Cheers for the II 

I would like to respond to a letter that ap- 
peared in September So/talk. The letter was 
from Kevin FitzMaurice concerning the Apple 
III. Don't misinterpret my comments; I am very 
impressed by the machine as a whole. It has 
many features that I would love to have on my 
Apple II, but it isn't tlie ideal computer that Mr. 



FitzMaurice seems to believe it to be. 

First, he made the right decision in choos- 
ing the Apple III over the IBM Personal Com- 
puter. What can you say about a machine 
with bugs so serious they render its double-pre- 
cision real numbers unusable? And a company 
that says, "Well, don't use double-precision 
reals!" I must object to some of the things stated 
in that letter. I would like to know how he de- 
termined it would take sixteen slots to make the 
IBM perform as well as the III (and where the 
extra $2,000 comes from). 

The business about the keyboard is highly sus- 
picious, as many people who compare the two 
prefer the pc, especially the flexibility of its be- 
ing detached. What good is having a different 
keyboard arrangement available when the con- 
toured keycaps don't allow you to change what 
you have to look at? I would find it very con- 
fusing to see a character on a key only to press it 
and get a different character. 

As for speed differences, whoever said the 
Apple III is 40 percent faster than the Apple 
II? Just because its processor runs just under 
two megahertz, compared to just over one m^a- 
hertz for the II, doesn't mean it gets things 
done any faster. The fact that it fights its way 
through 40K of operating system slows things 
down considerably. I work at a computer store, 
and after having talked to many customers and 
fellow salesmen who have owned both ma- 
chines, and having run numerous test pro- 
grams on both machines (in Basic, Pascal, and 
machine language), we have decided that the I II 
is consistently slower than the II. Its graphics 
are considerably slower, and its screen output is 
much slower. Apple even mentions in the man- 
uals for the III that if you instruct the console 
driver to flush output it speeds execution by al- 
most 30 percent. Its variable manipulations 
are noticeably slower (due undoubtedly to 
SOS's memory management), and its disk ac- 
cesses are very slow. The hierarchy that SOS 
maintains is nice, limited in use on floppy disk, but 
it causes considerable delays in accessing informa- 
tion on the disk. I was quite shocked and disap- 
pointed the first time I sat down to use Pascal on 
the Apple III. It took nearly twice as long to enter 
the filer than on the Apple II. Inspection of the fQes 
on the disk shows that the file is not significantly 
larger in the Apple Ill's version. Put a print-using 
statement in a loop sometime if you really want to 
see slow. 

SOS's powerful drivers are fine too, if you 
can get enough information to use them, or if you 
want to pay a lot of money to go to California 
to learn about the machine. SOS is actually a 
very powerful system, but I don't know that I 
would say it's user-friendly. Most Apple III sys- 
tems we sell require a salesperson to install the 
necessary drivers because the users don't have 
the knowledge needed to do it themselves. Re- 
call that Apple II device drivers are almost uni- 
versally stored in firmware on the card itself. 

FitzMaurice's assertion that SOS has no 
commands to learn is what is laughable. Does 
SOS read your mind? And the Apple III is the 
first RAM-based machine? Anybody remem- 
ber Digital Group? They were making RAM- 



based machines before Jobs sold his van to get 
the capital to help build the first Apple. 

I have to agree that IBM certainly chose an 
antique processor to put in its machine, and 
anybody knowing anything about the internals 
of the two knows that the Apple III is more of a 
sixteen-bit system than the pc is. I would really 
like to see the press release from Apple saying 
that the Apple IV will have a 6502B for I/O 
processing and can emulate an Apple III, or 
maybe see the person having that dream. 

Actually, since my Apple II here has a buff- 
ered printer interface card (next best thing to 
spooling, which by the way, Apple didn't see fit 
to incorporate as part of SOS); an Enhancer II 
from Videx with keyboard-definable macros 
(not on the III), autorepeat on all keys (fast re- 
peat with the repeat key), upper and lower case 
with shift key operation, alpha lock, caplock, 
and its own 6502 microprocessor; memory ex- 
pansions as large as 512K commercially avail- 
able (not on the III); 68000, Z-80, 8088, 8080, 
and 6809 processor cards available (not on the 
III); Fortran, Cobol, Lisp, APL, Logo, Pilot, 
Apex, and CP/M languages and operating sys- 
tems available for maximum programming 
flexibility (not on the III); and the largest base 
of software, hardware, and user support for any 
computer, I don't think I'm ready to give up my 
II just yet. 

The Apple III is an excellent machine, as is 
the II (IBM has a nice Basic), but they really 
don't compete at all. The Apple III makes a 
powerful, capable, business machine; the II, 
with such easy internal access, is extremely ver- 
satile for many apphcations — but the two 
should not be compared. They weren't de- 
signed to do the same job, so why compare Ap- 
ples and oranges? Forgive the pun. Yes, do 
yourself a favor, check out the Apple III, but 
don't forget the Apple II is still alive and well 
and living everywhere.

Voice from the Cave 

I have owned an Apple for about a year now, 
using it for balancing checks, magazine re- 
search, meal planning, typing lessons, and game 
playing. Zork II is the latest on my play list, 
achieving 380 points out of 400. I have one 
problem that fellow readers of Open Discussion 
might be able to give me a clue how to solve. 
Everything was okay up to 300 points, but I'm 
now in the repository after the cave has closed 
and can't figure out how to get out.

Accredited Questioner 

I caught an advertisement for Lobo disk drives 
and the specifications were quite simple. The 
price was $385, with the drive delivered to m\ 
door by UPS. All I had to do was call their 800 
number and give them my Visa card number. I 
said to myself, "Wow!" I picked up the phone 
and within a week the drive arrived. It was a 



DECEMBER 1982 



37 



mirror image of the Apple drive without the 
Apple logo. 

The drive worked beautifully for about a 
week. Then the Visa statement arrived. The 
drive started to give me I /O errors. Then I tried 
the 800 number. No satisfaction. I packed it up 
and wrote them a note to forget the whole deal, 
and that I wasn't paying the Visa bill. 

In no time flat, I received a letter from the 
general manager of Lobo International. He 
asked that I forgive them, saying they were ter- 
ribly sorry that I was inconvenienced. He also 
asked that I do them a favor and take another 
drive at the price of $250. 

I swallowed, and agreed. I received another 
drive, and needless to say it was absolutely per- 
fect. I still have Visa to straighten out though, 
and I expect that will take from six months to a 
year. I question whether I should have bought 
locally at a higher price and avoided the hassle 
that was involved with return of bad merchan- 
dise. Suppose it needed a repair job in two or 
three months? Would I have been smarter to 
buy from a local computer outlet with their own 
repair facilities? What is the answer?

Gold Bugged 

I am writing concerning a software rental club, 
the Goldcoast Computer Club of Bremen, 
Kentucky. 

I rented Screen Writer II from them when it 
was Superscribe II. It didn't bother me too 
much that the documentation was a copy (the 
disk seemed original), but I was unhappy that it 
was not the latest version advertised. Anyway, 
on the strength of the program received, I put in 
my order for Superscribe II. I waited out Gold- 
coast's move to Kentucky from Florida, and 
the changeover from SuperScribe II to 
Screenwriter II. 

I finally received the program with a letter 
from Dan Perry saying that the program disk 
looked used because he had tried to copy it and 
could not. While away, I noticed a large supply 
of Screen Writer II in a software store. 

To make a long story short, I had been 
shorted my backup disk and the product war- 
ranty registration card. I called Goldcoast, and 
Dan Perry said that he had taken the liberty of 
keeping the extra disk, but would send it to me 
if I insisted. I insisted. 

After failing to receive it I called again. 
Perry was very irritated, and said they were 
overworked and underpaid and would send the 
damn thing, and then he hung up on me. I 
called Sierra On-Line and they have agreed to 
send me a backup disk for the normal five 
dollar fee plus a warranty registration card. 

There is a need for a software rental service. 
It is the rare individual who can afford to keep 
purchasing programs until he finds one that fits 
his needs. In the case of Goldcoast Computer 
Club — you have been warned.

Let's Make Peace 

We were deeply upset and angered by the state- 
ment in October Marketalk News that our new 
Spitfire Simulator is for warmongers. This dis- 
tasteful statement in no way properly reflects ei- 
ther our intentions or the nature of this flight 
simulator. 

We developed certain flight simulator tech- 
niques and sought a suitable scenario for apply- 
ing them. We thought immediately of the Spit- 
fire airplane, the whole history of which is spe- 
cial. Its designer, Reginald Mitchell, dying of 
cancer, literally used his last remaining energy 
to complete the design of the Spitfire so that it 
might be used to defend Britain in the impend- 
ing war with Nazi Germany. The airplane itself 
was one of the finest airplanes ever to exist, and 
is greatly admired by airplane fanciers every- 
where. The Battle of Britain is a rare example of 
exceptional gallantry and heroism by a handful 
of men whose sole purpose was to defend their 
skies against aggressive invaders. 

We tried hard in Spitfire Simulator to pre- 
sent a situation where the user can enjoy all the 
positive aspects of the situation without any em- 
phasis on violence. Nowhere in our manual or

Point taken. 

On the other hand, no matter how well the 
package avoids mentioning "the taking of life," if 
a game simulates a war battle, then the simulated 
death of those battled against is implied. 

We have no argument with the value of war 
games, nor certainly with the admirable heroism 
the battle arena brings out in real life. But in real 
life or in its simulation, if the pilot of a bomber 
feels any less responsible for the "taking of life" 
than the infantry soldier plunging the bayonet, we 
are flirting with real danger. 

Simplicity Ventured 

Regarding October's Ventures with VisiCalc, I 
find that what is simple has been made 
complicated. 

First, in the averaging of grades, why not 
use a formula that is not only simpler to write 
but also easier to understand and requires less 
memory. That formula would substitute 
@SUM(B3...B17,B7,B12,B17)/18 (in Integer 
format, /FI) for the more complex formula 
@INT(@SUM (B3...B17-l-@LOOKUP 
(5,A3...A17)-h@LOOKUP(15,A3...A17)/18). 

In addition to the complexity of the pub- 
lished program, the use of the ©INT function 
will truncate the value rather than round, pos- 
sibly causing a letter grade difference. In the 
example in figure 4 on page 85, the average cal- 
culated using Joe Shelton's formula resulted in a 
90; the simpler formula results in a 91. 

Also, the look-up table in figure 5 on page 86 
need not be so complex. The ©LOOKUP func- 
tion was designed primarily with payroll with- 
holding tables in mind. VisiCalc will interro- 
gate the look-up files for an exact match. If an 
exact match is not found, it will pick up the next 
item lower in value. 

My experience with VisiCalc has been very 
pleasing and I have found it rather simple to 
use. I believe that there is no reason to make 
VisiCalc more difficult to use. In addition, Visi- 
Calc, with the right knowledge, can accomplish 
some rather complicated tasks. Some of these 
tasks that I have done include sorting and rank- 
ing, ©LOOKUP based on four separate var- 
iables, and extensive calendar date calculations. 
Steve Mehder, Greensboro, NC 

A Rumble about the Ramble 

I would like to take issue with Jonathan Mill- 
er's article "Word Handler Goes to the Mov- 
ies" in the October Softalk. What it says about 
word processing is interesting — it's just that it 
doesn't say that much. 

In the first place, there is absolutely no men- 
tion about how George Catanzano uses his Ap-

about how he uses it in his community work. As 
a matter of fact, about the only p^rt of the arti- 



cle directly relating to word processing is a fa- 
vorable comment on Word Handler and a few 
notes on the IDS Prism Printer. 

Rambling articles like this seem to be creep-

Mad into Glad 

I would like to offer some help to the Mad Sci- 
entist, whose letter appeared in the July Open 
Discussion, to all those whose intelligence seems 
to be above basic math, or to those who just 
plain need help. 

Making VisiCalc more or less accurate is 
only a matter of employing the integer function 
and a simple formula that can expand as needed to 
obtain the required accuracy. For example. 

@INT ((Cell) * X + .5) / X 

An ©INT ((Cell) + .5) produces a rounded in- 
teger; substituting 10 for x produces accuracy to 
one decimal place; 100 produces accuracy to 
two decimal places; and so forth. Increasing the 
figure substituted for x by another zero in- 
creases the accuracy by another decimal place. 
This can be done up to twelve zeros since the ac- 
curacy of VisiCalc is thirteen places. 

One note: Make sure the column width is 
large enough to display the entire number of 
your answer. For example, the number 
1 2345.7123 requires a column width of eleven in 
order to display the entire number. A column 
width of fewer than eleven will cause VisiCalc to 
display a number that is rounded down from 
the accuracy specified using the above formula, 
even though the number utilized in the calcula- 
tion is at the accuracy specified. 

VisiCalc will not display trailing zeros even 
in this defined accuracy format, but knowing 
that you have specified the accuracy should 
eliminate the question of precision. If column 
line-up is necessary, consider the /FL com- 
mand. For values, this command will bring all 
numbers to the left side of the cell (minus one 
space), with the decimals trailing out to the right 
of the cell.

Excepting the Pass 

I have to take exception to Ed Haymes's letter 
and another letter entitled Pass the Word (Oc- 
tober Ofjen Discussion) on the subject of 5m- 
perScribe II. I purchased a used Apple II about 
a year ago to use as a word processor for my 
master's thesis. I very quickly learned that 
Magic Window, which came with the machine, 
just wouldn't hack it. Unable to afford an 
eighty-column board, and not really knowing 
where to turn, I saw an ad for Word Handler. 
However, no one in New York had heard of the 
program and no one stocked it. I was offered in- 
stead Superscribe II. Adapting it to my system 
was easy. I found only two bugs, both minor. 
My only quibble was the time it took to switch 
disks and reload the editor and runoff. 

Now I ha\e Screenwriter II. The switch was 
made simple, thanks to the new customizer

module included. My two bugs have been fixed. 
I couldn't use the form-feed character with my 
MX-80, and justified hyphenation dropped the 
ends of words if the hyphenation occurred in 
the last word of a file. My other problem is 
printer-based and can only be solved with a new 
printer. (I need incremental spacing.) 

The program Fix Sector Count has become 
one of my most-used utilities, and I use it to 
provide more storage space on my archive and 
text disks. I use the editor to prepare "help" files 
for on-line use, for electronic mail, and, of 
course, for word processing.

has also been helpful and quick. When my 
documentation did not arrive with my update

rived the day after my call. 

A few applications notes: One can exit the 
editor by typing control-D FP on the command 
line and then rebooting. The joystick "mouse" 
option makes the program ideal for use by the 
handicapped. Mr. Haymes obviously didn't 
read his manual. One can catalog the disk dur- 
ing editor loads by typing control-D catalog 
when asked for input or output file names. In 
fact, much of the power of ScreenWriter II 
comes from the ability to use all standard DOS 
commands (except init) from within the pro- 
gram. A final note; the easiest way to provide

Make the Switch to a Capital Idea 

In the Ortober Open Discussion two questions 
were asked that I might be able to answer. 

Ralph Cinque wanted to know if there is a 
way to switch to text mode without bombing lo- 
res page one graphics. No, Ralph, there is no 
way, since the two modes use the same mem- 
ory location: 1024 to 2047 ($400 to %!¥¥). 
However, just before switching to text, you 
could move the data from that range to any 
area where there is a free kilobyte of memory, 
such as the area from 7168 to 8191. 

Here is one method of accomplishing this: 

FOR X = 1024 TO 2047: POKE X + 6144, 
PEEK(X): NEXT 

When you want to switch back to graphics, use 
this: 



FOR X = 1024 TO 2047: 
PEEK(X+6144): NEXT: GR 



POKE X, 



This method is very slow, but I don't know of a 
faster way. Also, I have no idea if this section of 
memory is always free. 

George D. Parker wanted to know why he 
cannot send a control-IA to his printer 
throu^ his Super-Text II. I had the same prob- 
lem ^h my Magic Window word processor. I 
suffered through it for several months until I got 
a lower-case chip and found out what I was do- 
ing wrong. Whereas I needed to send con- 
trol-IA to the printer, I was actually sending 
it control-la, which does absolutely nothing! 
Check to see if you, too, have been using a 
lower-case "a" instead of a capital.

A Lobster to Crack 

I have been frustrated with the Apple III in the 
emulation mode. I would get these nice mes- 
sages from an Apple II disk, such as, "Would 
you like a hard copy?" When I typed "Yes," I 
would get graphic fonts. Not being a software 
type, and also being a bit lazy, I asked my trusty 
software friend, Eden Recor, to please explain, 
"Was ist los mit minem computer." Quick as a 
wink, Eden came over and announced that the 
"stupid computer" was forcing the most sig- 
nificant bit high when it was printing, thus giv- 
ing me nothing but graphics characters. 

The solution was quite simple; just force the 
most significant bit low when wanting to print. 
Easier said than done, as I could not find any- 
thing in the Apple III documentation that 
would help me. I had already been into the ca- 
ble once to find out why I couldn't print at all, 
so I figured it would be easy, once and for all, to 
fix this Hummer (German word for lobster). 

As a quick fix, I just disconnected the wire 
for the most significant bit from the printer end

We hate to disappoint our 
public. So we keep you waiting. 
Because while the software facto- 
ries are cranking out arcade game 
after arcade game, pulpy adven- 
ture after trite fantasy, we're 
writing and rewriting, honing and 
perfecting. Before a single person 
enters one of Infocom's worlds, 
it must be crafted into a living, 
riveting, definitive experience. 



WE CAN! 

Judging from the public's reac- 
tion, it's worth the wait. For 
instance, Creative Computing 
welcomed DEADLINE™ as 
"thoroughly engrossing and real- 
istic," while a Softalk readers' 
poll recently voted ZORK™ I and 
ZORK II the most popular adven-

an exploration of a new 
dimension in science fiction, 
are ready for you. 

Look at them up there, 
the little worlds of Infocom. As

Computer/Printer Cable Modification 



I had been toying with the possibility of 
modifying the Apple III Universal Parallel In- 
terface Card (UPIC) in order to bring out the 
line feed control switch. Then I wouldn't have 
to open up the computer every time I wanted 
to utilize Apple II software, which was 
quite often.

UPIC Modihcalion 



So one night, when no one was looking, I 
took my handy dandy twenty-watt iron out of 
the workroom. I wired two switches into the 



system: one hanging off the cable between the 
computer and Epson MX-80 F/T printer, and 
the other parallel with the existing switch on the 
UPIC. If you leave the switch on the UPIC in 
the auto position the added switch will work 
just fine. I mounted the UPIC switch at the bot- 
tom of the UPIC's forty-pin connector. It works 
very well.

Unrectangled and Squared Away 

I recently purchased the GraForth program for 
the Apple II. I just wanted to say how pleased I 
am with the whole package. The manual is ex- 
cellent, the language is friendly yet very power- 
ful, and the utilities included make it very easy to 
use. So many of its features operate just the way 
I would want them to. Since I program exten- 
sively as part of my job as an engineer, I can ap- 
preciate how difficult it is to put together such a 
superior software package. 

One suggestion I have for the GraForth 
package relates to the turtle graphics com- 
mands. As supplied, if you give the appropriate 
commands to draw a square, it appears as a rec- 
tangle rather than as a square on the screen. 
This is due to the difference in scale of the X 
and Y axes on the Apple. A simple fix for this is 
to add a line that scales the Y axis in the source 
code of the word turtle.walk in the file Turtle. 
Here is the listing with the new line 90 added. 
With this simple correction, turtle graphics 
works great. I have been able to try many Logo- 
type experiments using these commands.

The manufacturer clarifies: 

The modification to the turtle graphics file that 
Steve Medwin describes does improve the sym- 
metry of the images created with turtle graph- 
ics. As he mentions, this is due to the fact that 
the Apple hardware actually plots dots closer 
horizontally than vertically. With his change in 
scaling, the bottom of the screen is now at 
Y = 235 rather than Y=191. Because of slight 
differences in TVs and monitors, the scaling 
may need to be adjusted a little to produce a 
perfect square. This can be done by changing 
the 123 in line 90 to a slightly higher or lower 
number. 

Phil Thompson, Insoft, Portland, OR 
No Small Change 

I read with interest the answer to dollar format- 
ting from Albert Pinto (September Open Dis- 
cussion). Immediately I keyed in the one line for 
formatting dollars with no negative numbers, 
line 61000. 1 then tried several values and all was 
well until I keyed in .995. To my dismay, it 
rounded off to 0.00, a whole dollar off. The 
problem comes from using two different num- 
bers, one for the whole part and the other for 
the decimal part of the number. On occasion 
they will round off differently; hence the dollar 
error instead of one cent. 

In the following listing the number is first 
converted to cents and then rounded off, and 
any error will only be one cent. The cents are 



KEEPING UP WITH 
FILING SPACE DEMANDS 
CAN BE TOUGH. 




WITH DB MASTER 
IT'S EASY. 



It seems to 
happen before you 
know it. The 
business is growing 
and, naturally, so are your files. 
But the more room you need for 
files the less there seems to be. 
You've added more people, more 

equipment, more capacity. The trouble is, you're trying 
to add more file space, when what you really need is 
more work space. Those filing cabinets full of folders are 
costing you too much— in time, in space, in money. 

That's where DB MASTER comes in. It provides 
plenty of expansion capability to meet the needs of most 
normal growing businesses that use an Apple II. The 
floppy diskette version, for example, can be expanded to 
contain up to 387,000 individual records. Need more? 
The DB MASTER Special Edition For Hard Disk can be 
expanded to contain up to 7 million individual records. 

Of course, the number of records you may store in 
your particular business depends on several variables- 
like the number of characters in each record and the kind 
of information storage you require. Ask your dealer to 
spell out for you just how much DB MASTER can help 
your operation. 

We designed DB MASTER to make your life easier. 
Sure, there are other data base systems for your 
Apple II. But if you're not using DB MASTER, you're 



TM 

simply not getting all 
you could from your 
data base manage- 
ment program. 
And there are three powerful 
accessory programs available to 
complement DB MASTER'S capa- 
bilities. UTILITY PAK #1, for 
example, allows you to access other standard Apple files 
(including VisiCalc), and even recover damaged files. 
UTILITY PAK #2 allows you to edit or change up to 
five "fields" in a single pass through your files. And 
STAT PAK performs statistical analyses on data in your 
DB MASTER files. Of course, there's considerably more 
capability in each of our accessory paks than we have 
room to talk about here. Ask your dealer for the full 
details. 

Stoneware backs up DB MASTER with a support staff 
second to none. Just give us a call. We can help solve 
your problems. After all, that's what Stoneware and 
DB MASTER are all about.

Sharp Distinctions 

Some time ago a letter appeared in Open Dis- 
cussion from a person who was extremely 
pleased to find CP/M conversion boards for the 
Apple, as it saved him from the burdensome 
commands necessary to operate Apple DOS. 
This fueled my already present interest in this 
"other" system, and finally last week I had the 
pleasure of working with CP/M for the first 
time on a Zenith Z90. I was setting up the ma- 
chine for a commercial establishment in an out- 
of-the-way location. The machine had been pur- 
chased frQm a local dealer who was untrained in 
computers, and I was called to the scene. 

What greeted me was a practically incom- 
prehensible manual for an almost hostile pro- 



gram. Apparently the CP/M producers thought 
it was insufficient merely to make an IBM-ori- 
ented program; they also copied the style of 
IBM manuals. I was indeed glad to return to 
my Apple and decided that anyone who thought 
CP/M was superior to Apple DOS must be a 
sales representative of Digital Research. 

CP/M has three (count 'em, three) error 
messages for disk operations. Theoretically one 
of these is for finding a damaged sector on the 
disk, one is for selecting a nonexistent disk 
drive, and one is for read-only disks. Unfortu- 
nately, if an error message appears, the best one 
can really do is assume that there is a problem 
somewhere around the disk drive; this can range 
from leaving the door open to having peanut 
butter on the disk. I even got a bad-sector mes- 
sage when trying to write to a protected disk, 
one of the three theoretically possible error con- 
ditions. The manuals do not mention such 
problems, limiting themselves to the theoretical 
problems corresponding to each message. 
Actually, the manuals seem to tell very little in a 
comprehensible manner. The CP/M manual 
has neither an index nor a complete table of 
contents. 

If anyone is still suffering from the cumber- 
someness of the Apple DOS commands and the 
CHR$(4) or D$ constructions, I recommend in- 
cluding statements similar to the following in 
the variable initialization part of the program: 

D$=CHR$(4) 

OPS = CHRS(4) + "OPEN" 



WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? 



Are you tired of waiting for DOS to 
load and save files? Are you tired of 
waiting for DOS to finish so you can 
type again? Are you tired of waiting 
for your printer? When you buy 
Diversi-DOS"^", you won't have to 
wait any nnore! Here's why: 

1. DOS speed-up: Apple DOS 3.3 
takes 18 disk revolutions to read a 
single track, whereas Diversi-DOS 
reads or writes a track in just 2 
revolutions. This speeds up file pro- 
cessing tremendously (see table). 

2. Keyboard Buffer: Diversi-DOS 
allows you to type at any time, as 
fast as you can, without missing a 
single character.

3. Print Buffer: Diversi-DOS can use 
a RAM card (16K-128K) to temporari- 
ly save characters before they are 
printed. Thus, your computer won't 
have to wait for your printer to 
finish. 

Diversi-DOS, the TRIPLE utility, re- 
quires a 48K Apple II or 11+ with

the un-protected disk. So what are 
you waiting for?

When I was finally able to get disks booted, 
I discovered that Microsoft Basic has some defi- 
nite improvements over Applesoft. These in- 
clude additional string functions, double preci- 
sion variables, statements to format numeric 
output, and if-then-else, nested if, and while- 
wend statements. On the other hand, compar- 
ing Basic versions is rather like asking which 
dull knife is better for slicing bread. After the 
operation, the result is still a mangled lump.

He'd Rather Be Bored 

As a recent subscriber to Softalk, I have no- 
ticed an annoying feature that has to do with 
the machine language programs. Why do you 
print them in assembler form? I love assembly 
programming, but as of today I still don't have 
an assembler such as LISA 2.5 or Merlin. Please 
write in machine code, for even though it is bor- 
ing, it would save me a lot of time trying to de- 
cipher your assembler code.

If you are in text mode, the following com- 





If your printer uses yotir Apple 
more than yoa do, 
you need The Bufferboard. 



If your Apple is locked into the "PRINT" 
mode so much that you've taken up soli- 
taire to kill the boredom, you need a 
buffer And if your computer is the Apple 
II or III, the only buffer for you is The 
Bufferboard. Expandable to 64K of stor- 
age, The Bufferboard stores an instantane- 
ous bucketful of print data from your 
computer Then it feeds the data to your 
printer at its own printing rate. Your Apple 
is set free from driving your printer and is 
ready for more data from you. 



or expensive power supplies are needed 
because The Bufferboard fits right into 
your Apple — and docks onto your existing 
printer interface. The result is convenient 





Take yottr existing interface — 
and bttffer it! 

Only The Bufferboard has a simple 
Interface-Docking System. No bulky boxes 



and economical buffering of most popu- 
lar printer interfaces, including the 
Grappler -i- ™ interface, Epson interface, 
and Apple printer interface. Thirty sec- 
onds and a single hook-up are all you need 
to end the printer waiting game forever. 

Up to 20 letter-size pages 
stored at a time. 

The Bufferboard comes standard with 
16K, and is expandable to 32K or 64K of 
buffering capacity with the addition of 




memory chips. This "bucket" will hold up 
to 20 pages of a print job, allowing you 
freedom to use your Apple. 

The Bufferboard — designed 
excIttsivelY for the Apple Computer. 

Specirications: 

• Versions for Grappler -)- interface, Epson 
interface, Apple interface, and other popu- 
lar printer interfaces • 16K buffer standard 

• Upgradeable to 32K or 64K • Automatic 
memory configuration • Automatic self 
test • Includes interface docking cable. 

The Bufferboard is made by Orange 
Micro, Inc.; the same people who brought 
you the popular Grappler -t- printer inter- 
face. Both the Grappler + and The 
Bufferboard are now available at your 
local Apple dealer.

a uniform manner. 

It's so easy. They simply 
"fill in the blanics" on the work-

Out without a Route 

For some time I have been looking for a pro- 
gram that could be used on my Apple II that 
would help me in routing buses for children's 
day camps and nursery schools. I thought we 
had found one in Vanlove's Directory, but we 
were advised that the software is no longer pub- 
lished because it didn't work. Our office assists 
Jewish Community Centers, YMHAs, 
YWHAs, and camps in developing computer 
technology to help them do a better job serving 
their members. 

To anyone who might have a lead on a pro- 
gram for bus routing, or even truck routing that 
might be adaptable — we would really appre- 
ciate the lead, and so would the children who 
could get to school or to camp more quickly 
and safely.

For Sailor Rent? 

Does anyone know of a reputable place to rent 
software? I'm not sure if such a place exists, but 
being in the Navy and being at an isolated 
duty station, it's impossible to review soft- 
ware before buying. I usually rely upon Sof- 
talk's reviews, but I still get programs that 
don't exactly fit my purposes. Sometimes I get 
arcade games that are not my type, or not what 
I expected, like Tank Command and i-Z) Skiing. 
In those, I expected more action and better 
i animation. Now they just lie here on my table 
collecting dust. Any suggestions? 
Dennis Heaton, Adak Island, AK 

Thai Writer 

I am a career missionary living in Bangkok, 
Thailand. My husband and I own an Apple II 
computer that we used for a myriad of personal 
uses. Recently, I've been exploring the possibil- 
ity of using the Apple coupled with our Epson 
printer for word processing in Thai and several 
of the hill-tribe languages in northern Thailand. 
I would sincerely appreciate hearing from any 
readers who have had experience with alternate 
character set manipulation, foreign language 
programming, and graphic dumps to a printer. 

I'm interested in hints, software, books, 
articles, anything that might help. I'd also like 
to correspond with others who are interested in 
this type of application. This is new territory for 
me; I want and need to learn all that I can.

The Emperor's New Tabs 

Needless to say, I was speechless upon learning 
that I had won a prize in your Apples in His- 
tory contest. 

The InvisiTabs arrived in the mail today 
(postage due) and they are a sight for sore eyes. 
I opened the package and there they were, 
sitting like ducks in a row, all neat and shiny 
and on their clear plastic backing sheet. I im- 
mediately decided to use one on my copy of 
VisiCrop. (You wouldn't believe the arguments 
I've had with those people about the documen- 
tation of that program.) Anyway, this brings me 
to the point of my letter, while the quality of the 
InvisiTabs is beyond reproach, the backing ma- 
terial is not of the same quality. Small pieces of 



the backing stick to the tabs and prevent them 
from sticking to the disk. They do allow the tabs 
to stick to my fingers, the soles of my shoes, and 
sometimes to the print head of my dot-matrix 
printer. 

Is there any possibility that this seemingly 
minor flaw in an otherwise unbeatable product 
could be corrected? If so, please send me some 
replacement tabs. I'm enclosing the old ones 
with this letter for your examination. 

Thanks again for the prize and your con- 
tinuing concern for both the novice and experi- 
enced computer hobbyist. As Vincent van Gogh, 
the nineteenth-century Dutch artist who cut off 
his ear for love, once said, "Huh?"

Opposite page: Operations manager Terry Lewis, a friendly native Texan who doesn't mind worl<ing with a "Damn Yankee." 
Above: former magician, disc jockey, jazz musician, and programmer Ted Gillam, founder of TG Products. 







native Texans have two ways of describing you if you come from one of the forty-nine other United States. You're 
ather a Yankee or a Damn Yankee, and they don't mean the Bronx Bombers. A Yankee comes to Texas for a visit. A Damn Yan- 
kee moves there. 

Ted Gillam is a Damn Yankee. He's also the man behind the initials of TG Products. 

There's a story to tell about the origin of the name TG Products. It has nothing to do with irate Texans, but it's a good intro- 
duction to one of the most respected and well-loved figures in the Apple world. 

Gillam helped pay his way through college in a variety of colorful ways. At Ann Arbor, he was a disc jockey for the University 
of Michigan's radio station. It was the fashion in those days among DJs to use only initials. Gillam was known as "The Big TG." 

Many years after college, on the day Gillam filled out the forms for his sales tax number, he was caught by surprise. To get the 
number, he was required to put something down for the title of his company. "The first thing that popped into my head was TG 
and that's what I put on the form." 

The Lonely and the Brave. Everything in Texas is big. The hats are big. The cars are big. The airports are big. The talk is big. 
And most of the residents are big-hearted. 

This still steaming prehistoric graveyard is a land of personalized license plates and opulent displays of wealth by the more well- 
to-do natives. There's no doubt about it. Texas is big, larger than life, the stuff of legends. Tall as Davy Crockett, wild as the Rio 
Grande. 

The spirit of independence runs strong in Texas. Who knows? Even Gillam thinks it possible that someday Texas may secede 
from the rest of the country. Texans are reputed to be suspicious and fiercely loyal, but they are not against progress. In fact, prog- 
ress, in the form of new technologies and new ideas, puts them in a better position to survive independently should they ever pull 
out and set up shop on their own. 

Hard-earned independence is something that Ted Gillam can relate to. It's the goal for anyone who starts his own business, but 
continues to serve another master to pay the bills. It's the goal for anyone who is tied to responsibilities that suck away vital energy 
and time. It's the goal of the young and the suppressed. It's the story of humankind.

How small you are when you step away from the larger entities 
makes no difference. In the case of TG Products, more than just one per- 
son is breaking free; a group can share the dream of independence just as 
well as any individual can. A lone star can be many bright spots gath- 
ered together in one glorious configuration of light. 

Cautiously Gambling. For a man who says he is cautious, Ted Gil- 
lam sure doesn't carry it to an extreme. In fact, blessed with a pleasant 
temperament — cool, calculating, and confident — he seems to enjoy tak- 
ing risks. A Yankee on the road. 

Gillam came to the Dallas area in 1977, hired by Perkin-Elmer as re- 
gional manager of software services. Perkin-Elmer is a Fortune 500 com- 
pany specializing in high technology items like the precision optics used 
in the space telescope. It's involved with many applications involving 
large number crunching, including a space shuttle simulator for the Na- 
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration. 

For three and a half years, Gillam worked with programmers and 
system analysts, covering the tracks left by speedy, cut-rate salesmen. 
"They would always stretch the truth and we'd come in not knowing 
whether the application was possible." Gillam was regularly on the road, 
or in the air, four days a week. 

Another part of Perkin-Elmer's operation is time-sharing. Gillam of- 
ten took a terminal home to get in some extra hours of work. He'd also 
go into the office on the weekends and his son would come along. Father 
and son shared a passion for programming and the world of computers. 
At the ripe old age of eleven, Richard Gillam announced his desire to 
have a home computer. Toward the end of 1979, parent Ted realized that 
he too wanted a personal computer. 

"I was becoming a technological dinosaur. In some growing compa- 
nies, if you are good at what you do, they promote you to a higher posi- 
tion. I was a good programmer, but I also made a good manager. Sud- 
denly programming was not a part of my job and I missed it. I decided to 
get an Apple so I could catch up and not lose touch with what was hap- 
pening in computers." Around Christmas 1979, the Gillams got their 
Apple. 

Ted Gillam's experience with programming and computers goes 
back a long way. He considers himself a programmer by trade, though 
he mainly programs for his own pleasure now. In his day, Gillam has 
programmed in Basic, Cobol, and Fortran. On the Apple, he has mostly 
written programs for his or his children's personal use. These include 
logic games and card games. He also wrote a "pretty good" disk utility 
when there weren't any available. 

Now on the Air. It all started in his freshman year of college, when 
Gillam earned only a passing mark in a one-hour computer course. That 
didn't phase him. 

"There were these bulletin boards around campus with notices ad- 
vertising programming help. I put one up and charged double what the 
others were asking. My first customer was a professor and I managed to 
deliver what he wanted." Gillam went after computers with the same 
gusto with which he pursued other favorite pastimes. 

Besides being a disc jockey and a freelance programmer in college, 
Gillam was a jazz musician. He played the drums in many local bars in 
the Detroit area. He also played in rock bands and big bands, but he 
mainly stuck to four or five player combos. He still has his drum set; and, 
after a particularly rough day in the office, he goes home and takes out 
his frustration by pounding out a mean rhythm. 

During college Gillam also practiced magic, a hobby he's enjoyed 
since he was five. He's out of practice now; to be a good magician you 
have to practice at least an hour a day. Still, he can do sleight of hand 
card tricks that are beyond most people's range. 

After college, Gillam weni on to become an industrial engineer at 
General Motors in his home town of Detroit. There he worked in the da- 
ta processing department, responsible for production control and inven- 
tory control. Next he did a stint at Xerox, first as a system programmer 
and later as district manager, a position similar to the one he would have 
at Perkin-Elmer. When he felt that Xerox was about to leave the com- 
puter field, Gillam went to work at Arthur Young and Company as a 
management consultant. 

It was soon after getting his Apple that Gillam got the idea of mak- 
ing a joystick. "I figured that if I could sell one I could take the comput- 



er off my taxes as a business expense. I took my first working joystick to 
a local store, which agreed to take it on consignment." 

After that initial success, Gillam decided to expand his market. He 
still traveled four days a week and decided to put the joystick in his suit- 
case and take it with him to show computer stores while on the road. 

Cowboys, Tigers, and Indians. Early in March 1980, Computerland 
of Cleveland put in a purchase order for twenty-four joysticks. Then a 
store in Detroit ordered six. Suddenly he had sold thirty and was really in 
business. 'Those early homemade joysticks were ugly, but they sold." 
Gillam took the grocery money and bought parts to fill the thirty orders. 

TG Products was set up in the garage where Gillam built the joy- 
sticks by hand. Acting as his own marketing department, he traveled 
from city to city. He claims to have visited just about every computer 
store east of the Rockies. "There were not a lot of distributors at the 
time. You had to go out and do it yourself" 

By Christmas 1980. the business was doing very well. In January 
1981, Muse released ABM, an arcade game written with joystick control 
in mind. Orders for TG's joystick went through the roof Joyce Gillam 
helped process and pack orders, while the kids assembled and tested each 
joystick. Son Richard wrote the program that was originally used for 
invoicing. 

Finally, Gillam decided to hire the services of a couple of production 
companies for the actual assembly. He also thought the time was right to 
bring out a new set of game paddles for the Apple. Coincidentally, Ap- 
ple decided to withdraw their own game paddles from the market. The 
timing couldn't have been better. TG sales went through the roof again, 
forever ending the days of a family/garage business. 

Around this time, Gillam met Terry Lewis, who was in charge of 
production at one of the hired-out companies. Lewis, a native of Austin, 
Texas, worked for Southwestern Bell Telephone for eight years before 
going to work for his father. He eventually set up his own company with 
eight employees. They did the production of TG's joysticks and paddles. 

Eventually, both Gillam and Lewis realized that economics dictated 
consolidating their efforts. TG Products was incorporated in August 
1981. Lewis didn't feel that the change meant he was going to work for

someone else. Besides, he sees Gillam as one of the most easygoing peo- 
ple imaginable. Together, they put TG where it is today, a successful, 
continually growing company. 

Looking To Get Out. At the same time that TG incorporated, Gil- 
lam's great escape finally happened. From working two full-time jobs, 
Gillam made that all important move. He left his normal, secure, well- 
paying job for the uncertainty and freedom of running his own business. 
Gillam started full time at TG on August 1, 1981. He handled the selling 
and the paperwork, while Lewis became the production manager. 

Lewis has now been bumped up to the role of operations manager. 
He coordinates the day-to-day activity — purchasing of materials, distri- 
bution, and communicating with dealers. "When Ted gets an idea, it's 
usually up to me to figure out how to make it work. This is a small com- 
pany and everyone wears a lot of different hats." 

Lewis says that TG is currently adding four to five anployees a month. 
People from a local sheltered workshop for the handicapped in Allen, 
Texas, do some of the assembly work. This arrangement enables TG to 
control costs very accurately. Other TG employees include local women 
who have small children and prefer to work at home. These workers 
come in each day for parts and work at their leisure. 

Lewis is in agreement with Gillam on the company's moves to di- 
versify and expand their markets. The first evidence shows in joysticks 
and paddles for the Apple III and the IBM Personal Computer. But the 
future may bring far more dramatic developments. "The industry is 
changing so fast that one can only speculate. In the case of peripherals, 
there are too many dollars lying out there for the big companies not to 
get involved." TG is just now seeing competition from much bigger, rich- 
er companies. 

In an effort not to fall behind, TG is in the process of upgrading their 
joystick in a few key ways. First they're replacing the ribbon cable with a 
molded cable that is configured for the Apple. It'll be strain relieved with 
no stress points. There will also be versions of the joystick that are cen- 
tering and noncentering. When you're using a joystick for producing 
graphics, it's annoying to have the joystick pop back to the straight-up 
position when you let go. 

Ramsey/ Shaver, TG's advertising agency, has developed new pack- 
aging that'll simplify the selling process for dealers. A handsome card- 
board box with a plastic bubble displays the top of the product. Buyers 
can now have a look at what they're getting. 

TG has always been insistent on maintaining the quality of their 
product and its long reliability. "I use the same buttons today that I used 
in the beginning. They're good for one million to two million cycles. I 
wanted a joystick that could position easily on an x and y grid and last. 
So I used potentiometers that have a long life of a million cycles," 
explains Gillam. 

The Texas Hacksaw Massacre. The striving for quality has had its 
scary moments, though, particularly in the family/garage days. "There 
were some real tense moments when the custom-made potentiometer 
shafts were too long. There were five thousand of them and the biU was 
huge. I used a hacksaw to grind them down. With the shaft too long the 
potentiometer couldn't get to zero. It took a solid week in the garage, 
dining room, family room; everywhere I went around the house, I was 
sawing away. And Joyce saying to me: 'What are we going to do if these 
things don't work?' And me answering, 'Yes, I know.' " 

Ever since the days when he used to travel most of the week and hit 
computer stores in the evenings, Gillam has considered the marketing 
end of TG Products weak. He was also TG's one-man advertising de- 
partment until this year, when he finally farmed out that task to an 
agency. 

The marketing problem is now solved by the arrival of Don Geyer as 
director of marketing. Recently of Gebelli Software, Geyer officially 
comes on board at TG this month. What with Trak Ball and the up- 
dated joysticks, he'll have his hands full. 

One aspect of marketing that'll probably stay the same is Gillam's 
philosophy about trade shows. "They're awfully expensive for what you 
get out of them. I think most people going to a show are looking for a 
discount. I'd rather keep with institutional advertising and communicat- 
ing with distributors. By far the best kind of marketing is good word of 
mouth from satisfied customers."

DECEMBER 1982 



TG's Trak Ball is a logical departure from previous graphic input de- 
vices, a product the company hopes will open the eyes of Apple game 
players and artists around the worid. 

A joystick has a swing of only sixty degrees. Trak Ball has a range of 
one and a half turns. It's more accurate, noncentering, and allows finer 
control. Modified, it could be used to move the cursor in a VisiCalc 
model as well as in games and graphics. 

Gillam did not study about computer game peripherals in college. He 
does not have a master's in graphics control systems. He just has the 
knack for coming out with the right product at the right time. Trak Ball 
may not make a bigger splash than TG's joystick, but it's brand-new and 
no one has done it before. 

Rough estimates have it that one-quarter of the Apples sold are 
equipped with one or more of TG's products. With the arrival of Trak 
Ball that figure may become one-third. Any way you look at it, TG has 
enjoyed enormous success; but the future is always uncertain. 

The Big Broadcast of 1982. Ted Gillam is a dreamer — a philosophi- 
cal entrepreneur caught in the world of big business. That's what the 
Apple market has become — big business, big bucks. 

"There was a time when this industry was only small companies run 
by a few people who all knew each other. Now there are a lot of big cor- 
porations entering the market and ail they care about is the bottom line, 
a profit. These companies that are a 'division of really cause grief when 
they throw money around but don't add anything to the industry. 

"It's tough for us little guys to complete with their marketing. I be- 
lieve in putting out a good product and standing behind it. In the long 
run, word of mouth will kill an inferior product. But you have to wait 
out the marketing blitz and hope you survive." 

Quality and service are two facets of business that keep the world 
from sinking into a puddle of mediocrity. Up to this time TG has had a 
ninety-day warranty on all their products, but they may soon change this 
to a year. Both Lewis and Gillam claim that no one has been charged 
more than five dollars for repairs or replacement. This has created ter- 



rific good will among customers and dealers, something that faceless big 
corporations can't ignore. 

An industry observer, Gillam feels that the time has ended when one 
dimensional companies can survive in the Apple market without diversi- 
fying. Even a company like VisiCorp, with their monster seller VisiCalc, 
is feeling the pressure. 

Gillam is very guarded about what plans he has for TG, but going 
into the software business is not unlikely. He can't always rely on a soft- 
ware publisher to back up his products, the way Muse did with the joy- 
stick version of ABM. Sure, there are many different machines that TG 
can make peripherals for, but the name of the game now seems to be re- 
lated products as well. And that means software. 

When all's said and done, the folks at TG Products have fun. The at- 
mosphere is friendly and relaxed. Employees are encouraged to take 
breaks and play games on the computers. Every year, TG has two office 
parties, one celebrating Christmas and the other celebrating August 1, 
1981, the day TG became a real company. 

Gillam has a terrific rapport with the people who work for him and 
everyone appreciates his sense of humor and open mind. Lewis de- 
scribes it best: "This is the first job I've had where I don't feel afraid to 
disagree. Ed and I have a very complementary relationship." 

Deep in the Heart of Texas. The Big TG drives a Continental Mark 
VI with a digital dashboard ("I'm a gadget freak"). Every day before 
driving to work he gets up an hour early so he can read. An avid science 
fiction fan, his favorite authors are Heinlein and Larry Niven. And, of 
course, he plays a lot of games on the Apple. His current favorites in- 
clude ABM, Castle Wolfenstein, Teleport, Ceiling Zero, Marauder, and 
Thief. 

Deep down, Gillam would like someday to be a disc jockey again. 
But at the moment he's too wrapped up with paddles and joysticks to 
pursue that fantasy, so Apple owners can breathe a sigh of relief. If Gil- 
lam has his way, the market won't change entirely for the worse and the 
original spirit will live on, gloriously. 3i

THE BASIC 



Solution 



By Wm.VR, Smith 



Computers are quickly beginning to invade 
the gambling casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic 
City. Mechanical slot machines are being re- 
placed with video monitors and microcom- 
puters. 

These new computer slot machines offer a 
lot more variety than the old-fashioned ones 
did. They can simulate all types of gambling 
games. Computerized versions of blackjack, 
keno, and poker are already visible in the ca- 
sinos. Money is received and counted, odds are 
computed, visual effects are produced, and pay- 
off is made — all under microprocessor control. 
Be assured about the accuracy of these com- 
puter slot machines; the gambling commissions 
review every aspect of a program to verify its 
correctness. 

One of the most proper games is draw 
poker, in which the player is allowed to bet 
from one to seven coins per hand. The payoff 
odds are computed for all the possible winning 
poker hands and presented on the video dis- 
play. 

For those who aren't famihar with all the 
possible poker hands, table 1 gives their names 
and payoff odds. 

In video poker, as in the standard game, five 
cards are dealt to the player. A flashing bar is 
moved from card to card with a push button. 
The player must select which of the five cards to 
keep. After making the selection, the player 
presses another button to draw new cards. 

The final cards are dealt and the hand is 
then reviewed by the computer for payoff. If the 
hand is a winner, the proper hand description 
and corresponding payoff are shown in inverse 
lettering and the payoff is produced. 

This month's Basic program exactly simu- 
lates the draw poker machines in the casinos. 
The only difference is that no money is re- 
quired to play the Basic version. 

If you're interested in card games, you'll en- 
joy reviewing the code. The computation of the 
hand in this program is very quick compared to 
other programs that have been made available 
in the marketplace.

To keep things simple we "drew" the cards 
using standard ASCII characters. You may 
wish to improve the card graphics. If you do 
create a better deck of cards, send them to Sof- 
talk Poker, Box 60, North Hollywood, CA 
91603. If your cards are used, you'll receive a 
$10 credit at your local dealer. 

And here's one final gift to those readers 
who have been requesting a fix to the print op- 
tion limitation in BasiCalc. Briefly, the pro- 
gram sends only fifty rows to the printer. 
Changing one line and adding another will al- 
low all rows to be printed. 

6045 IF Y1 > 51 THEN Y1 = 51 
6240 IF Y1 < 1 OR Y1 > 69 THEN XI = 
0;Y1 = 0 

The compiled versions of BasiCalc cannot 
be adjusted. If you have a compiler, however, 
you can compile your corrected, uncompiled 
version.

PROGRAMMABLE 
DATABASE 

At last there is a database with good menus that 
you can program. This database produces multiple 
labels for mailing complete with horizontal and ver- 
tical tabs settings. 

ON-LINE DATABASE is an accurate name given to 
this program because it was developed with high 
speed retrieval in mind. It is an excellent program to 
use on a network for keeping track of hundreds of 
filecards of information. Individual records can be 
printed while viewing, in either a screen print or a 
preset label format. Examples are included of files 
that can be used for mailing lists and have user 
defined parts in each record for general usage. 
ON-LINE DATABASE is written in Applesoft basic 
but all searches use a machine language binary 
search that easily finds one record out of a thou- 
sand in one second. Approximately 1000 names can 
fit on a single 143K floppy. Up to 239 characters can 
fit in each record. Up to 9 sort keys can be made on 
any part of any field. Complete facilities for chang- 
ing Slot, Drive, and Volumes are included with user 
programmable defaults, fvlultiple files can be stored 
on a standard Apple DOS volume on any device sup- 
porting standard DOS 3.3. 

ON-LINE DATABASE creates standard Apple Ran- 
dom Access Text files for easy transferring of infor- 
mation to other languages and computers. The 
documentation and program were written for first 
time users of a computer. Included are sample 
datafiles and pictures of screens using the sample

APPLESOFT 
MAKES A LEVEL 



Pity the poor Basic programmer. Politely 
condescended to by aficionados of Pascal, left in 
the silicon dust of super-serious assembler jock- 
eys, the humble computer monoglot quietly 
makes do with a language that's easy to learn, 
but slow, unstructured, and, on the Apple, not 
even all there. 

In some of its mainframe manifestations, 
even Basic has certain amenities built in. But 
such useful constructions as print using and 
if- then -else never made it into Applesoft. The 
Apple also lacks a full-blown editor, substituting 
for one its own ingenious escape-key editing fea- 
tures. Apple's editing is a simple, elegant, and 
memory-efficient approach, but it's not always 
the most convenient. 

These are indeed shortcomings, ones that 
have actually caused some programmers to turn 
to other microcomputers. Fortunately, some of 
the most talented programmers around were at- 
tracted to the Apple for its other fine qualities. 



These folks, having been brought to a boil and 
then simmered over low heat for a few years, 
have produced an amazing array of software for 
the Apple, some of which is geared to over- 
coming just those shortcomings that prompted 
their less farsighted program brethren to look 
elsewhere. 

Three types of program package have been 
designed to fill in the various gaps and limita- 
tions in Applesoft Basic. Basic' (pronounced 
"Basic prime") from Delta Micro Systems and 
Symbolic Basic Translator from Powersoft at- 
tempt in different ways to improve the struc- 
ture of the language. GPLE from Synergistic 
Software and Macro-Seed from Computer Sta- 
tions approach the problem of Apple's limited 
editor. Finally, The Routine Machine from 
Southwestern Data Systems gives Basic back its 
missing commands — with a few more thrown in 
that you won't even find on the mainframes. 

Basic'. Basic' actually extends Basic syntax. 



borrowing some conventions from Pascal and 
contributing a few innovations. You write your 
program on an editor named Editor' and then 
send it to a processor to be translated into Ap- 
plesoft. 

The commands that this package adds to 
Basic are very powerful control statanents. Con- 
trol statements are those commands that tell the 
computer where in the program to go next: for 
example, some of Applesoft's control state- 
ments are for— next, goto, gosub- return, and 
if-then. To begin with, Basic' eliminates goto 
entirely, for good or ill, and introduces a num- 
ber of new statements to fill the void. 

Basic' uses no line numbers in its source 
code. Instead, the processor reads indentations 
in the source to determine where loops and sub- 
routines end, eliminating the need for next, re- 
sume, and return. For is still used in the same 
format, except that there is an optional until 
condition that allows you to exit the loop be-

fore its normal completion. For instance, if until 
X> 22 is encountered in a loop, and the condi- 
dition is true, control moves to the next hne that 
is one level of indentation to the left of the until 
line. 

Another kind of loop that Basic' introduces 
is initiated by the repeat command. This in it- 
self is an unconditional loop and will continue 
indefinitely if not terminated by some other 
control statement, most commonly until. 

The if statement has undergone a few 
changes. In Basic' it is followed by an indented 
routine, eliminating the need for a then. The else 
option, a convention common to niost Basics 
that never made it to Applesoft, is included in 
Basic'. Normally, if the condition in an if state- 
ment is false, control is passed to the next line. 
An else, which follows the commands executed 
by the if, allows you to enter another command 
or series of commands in the event of a false 
condition. 

In the absence of line numbers, you use pro- 
cedure names defined with the proc command. 
You can call on these procedures via the do 
command, which acts the same as gosub. When 
a line with the next level of indentation to the 
left is encountered in the subroutine, control is 
passed back to the next command after the do. 

Perhaps the most powerful statement that 
Basic' introduces is case, which is used in this 
format: 

CASE A$ 
#"YES" 
DO SOMETHING

#"N0" 

DO NOTHING 
#"MAYBE" 

DO ASK-AGAIN 

In this example, if A$ =^ "Yes" the pro- 
gram will go to the procedure named Some- 
thing. "No" will send it to the procedure Noth- 
ing, and "maybe" will send it to Ask- Again. Any 
number of conditions can be set up with case, 
which can also be used with numeric variables. 
Else can be used with this construrtion as well. 

If you want any procedure to be assigned a 
particular line number when the program is 
translated to Applesoft, you can use the com- 
mand equ followed by the procedure name and 
the line number desired; this must be placed at 
the beginning of your program. 

Editor' is a good example of how a dedi- 
cated program editor can be better in some 
ways than a text editor for entering program 
code and, in other ways, worse. For instance, 
because Editor' recognizes that you are enter- 
ing code, it assists in implementing the 5aj/c' in- 
dentation conventions. If you are in a loop or 
loops, it automatically indents two spaces per 
nested level. To indicate to the editor to end a 
loop, you hit the back arrow key and the cur- 
sor moves two spaces to the left. Remember, it's 
very important to indent correctly, because an 
end of indentation takes the place of the return, 
next, and resume statements. 

There are a few other features in the edi- 
tor's favor. It fully supports a two-disk system 
but doesn't require one. With one or two drives, 
it gives excellent disk prompting. When you're 
loading or saving files, the editor will give the 
last name you used as a default whenever 
possible. It also automatically heads any 
printout with the file name and the date. 

A disadvantage of Editor' is its inabihty to 
display any line beneath the one currently be- 
ing edited or inserted. Another drawback is that 
the scrolling is slow enough to cause real prob- 
lems when you're editing a large program. 

When you've finished editing a file, you then 
go to Basic' and process it. The processor pro- 
vides a formatted listing of the source file, with 
comments that are in command hnes moved to 
the right margin and comments on their own 
lines left where they were. Provisions are also 
made for centering important comments and 
surrounding them with equal signs that extend 
across the width of the page. Finally, the pro- 
gram translates the file to an Applesoft pro- 
gram and saves it to disk. 

For all of the "powerful" commands that 
Basic' adds to Applesoft, it will not ultimately 
produce faster running or more efficient pro- 
grams, because it has to translate the new com- 
mands into Applesoft in order to run them. It 
may make a program easier to write, once you 
become accustomed to the new syntax. To be as 
powerful a language as it could be, given its ex- 
tended features, Basic' should really have either 
its own interpreter, like Basic, or a compiler, 
like Pascal. 

Symbolic Basic Translator. This package is 
designed to eliminate the need for line number- 



ing and to allow the programmer to use vari- 
able names of more than two characters. While 
Applesoft allows more than two characters in 
a variable name, it only allows two significant 
characters. In other words, month will be read 
as the same variable as mother. Symbolic Basic 
Translator allows you to use meaningful vari- 
able names without the possibility of confu- 
sion. Symbolic Basic Translator's system also al- 
lows you to use names that contain parsed 
words, names like tomorrow, which Applesoft 
would throw out because it contains to and or. 
Anything that begins with an at-sign(@)will be 
intepreted as a variable. 

Applesoft's line number convention is re- 
placed by a label convention in Symbolic Basic 
Translator. Simply stated, any place you would 
need a line number, you use a label instead. A 
label must be preceded by a number sign (#) 
character. Naturally, most lines don't require a 
label, just the ones that are accessed by goto, 
gosub, or if— then. In addition, you can tell the 
translator which comments in the source code 
you want passed on to the object code. Simply 
use REM at the beginning of a comment you 
want to keep and delimit a comment you want 
only in the source by using parentheses and as- 
terisks, like so: 

{* THIS IS A COMMENT *) 

Symbolic Basic Translator has three optimi- 
zation levels to choose from when translating. 
This means that you can generate a code that is 
easy to read and edit, a code that is crushed to 
run faster and use less memory space, or one 
that's somewhere in between. 

Unlike Basic', Symbolic Basic Translator 
does nothing to extend the syntax of Basic. 
What it does do is allow you to write somewhat 
more understandable programs through the use 
of labels, meaningful variable names, and selec- 
tive indentation. Don't expect much more than 
that. 

A bit of high-tech caveat emptor here. Be- 
fore you run out to buy Symbolic Basic Trans- 
lator, be advised that it does not come with an 
editor. You would not discover this until you 
read the manual, however, because neither the 
advertising brochure nor the outside of the 
package advises you of this. From the entry in 
the table of contents, "The Editor," you might 
assume that the program has one, but the page 
referred to merely explains that it doesn't, and 
that you have to use your own. If you have an 
editor that's compatible, there's no problem; 
you won't have to learn a new set of editor com- 
mands. If not, you'll have to buy one in order to 
use this program. Most text editors are com- 
patible, but it's best to be sure yours is before 
you leave the store. 

When considering any of these products, 
keep in mind that there is probably a tradeoff 
involved. The Applesoft Basic editor and inter- 
preter may be lacking in a few areas, but they 
have the advantage of being extremely conveni- 
ent. At the root of this convenience is the fact 
that the editor and the interpreter are both 
ROM-based and completely interactive. This

allows you to write a piece of code and test it on 
the spot, without having to save to disk, load 
and run a processing program, and retrieve the 
object code from disk. 

Basic' and Symbolic Basic Translator re- 
move this type-and-run convenience from Ba- 
sic. They also make error-handling less con- 
venient than it is in unmodified Applesoft. 
Normally, error messages give the line number 
where the break occurred. You can immediate- 
ly go back and change the line in a listing you 
are familiar with. If you used one of these proc- 
essors and have an error, you have two choices: 
either go to the object code generated by your 
source code and fix the problem there, which 
means that the same error will occur the next 
time you process the source code, or go back to 
the source code and try to find the error in an 
unnumbered listing. Basic' at least gives you a 
cross-referenced listing when it interprets the 
source code. Symbolic Basic Translator doesn't. 

In selecting any package that claims to 
make programming easier by extending Apple- 
soft Basic, you have to consider the tradeoff. 
What are the disadvantages? What aspects are 
being presented as advantages? Is what you're 
going to be getting more important to you than 
what you might be giving up? 

Cooperative Editing. GPLE, the Global 
Program Line Editor from Synergistic Soft- 
ware, and Macro-Seed from Computer Sta- 
tions are editors that work with Applesoft in- 
stead of going around it. Once you've booted 
either of these packages up, you can then move 
on to something like standard programming; 
that is, standard in that you can type and run as 
usual, but there is a difference. The added fea- 
tures don't jump out at you and announce their 
presence with prompts and menu options, but 
they are there nonetheless. Both of these 
packages give you — drum roll, please — extra 
editing options. 

Given the problem of the limited Apple edi- 
tor, these programs approach the solution in 
very similar ways. Through a series of control 
characters, they offer enhanced editing options, 
allowing sophisticated functions such as insert, 
delete, search, and replace to be performed with 
far greater ease and speed than similar opera- 
tions done with Apple's escape editing. Also, 
both programs provide keyboard macros. 
These are usually two-key sequences — escape 
followed by one other character — that take the 
place of much longer commands and sets of 
commands. Each package offers a library of 
predefined macros and a facility for creating 
your own sets. 

Despite similarities in concept, there are 
many differences in the ways these two pro- 
grams treat the general theme. Let's examine 
each of the programs in more detail. 

Macro-Seed. The Computer Station edit- 
ing package seems to have been designed with 
two main concerns in mind. The first is memo- 
ry. Macro-Seed's editor and macro tables to- 
gether occupy only one-and-a-half kilobytes of 
RAM, By making extensive use of calls to 
Monitor subroutines, this small program 
accomplishes the work of a much greater 



amount of code. 

The second consideration, related to the 
first, is an apparent desire to build this editor on 
the conventions of the Apple. The basic prem- 
ise behind line editing with Macro-Seed is list- 
ing the line to the screen and copying the parts 
you want into the input buffer, at the same time 
getting rid of undesired parts or adding new 
ones. 

As you probably know, the Apple uses a 
similar approach, except that instead of physi- 
cally deleting the parts you don't want, you 
move the cursor over them without copying (via 
escape-K), or type spaces over them — provided 
they weren't in quotes, a data statement, or a re- 
mark. Inserting is somewhat more difficult; you 
can't just type something in without overwrit- 
ing something else. So you must move the cur- 
sor up a few lines, type in the insertion, and 
move the cursor back down to the middle of the 
line and continue. This looks exceedingly messy 
on the screen. Or you can throw up your hands 
in despair and just retype the whole line, as 
many have. 

The editing features of Macro-Seed allow 
you to perform insertions and deletions more 
elegantly without changing Apple's basic edit- 
ing method. Cursor movement is achieved 
through the control key and a diamond com- 
prising the letters W, A, S, andX. Insertions are 
accomplished by moving the cursor to the de- 
sired location in the line and typing control-I. 
This splits the line at that point, scrolling every- 
thing before the cursor up one line. You can 
then type whatever you want in the space 



provided. 

Other features allow you to tab the cursor in 
various ways, save and restore cursor positions, 
delete a character at the cursor, and so on. 

As you can see, Macro-Seed is very cursor- 
oriented. One unique feature is control-L, which 
starts moving the cursor toward the end of the 
line. Any key will stop the cursor wherever it is, 
and all characters the cursor has moved over 
will have been copied into the input buffer. Us- 
ing the macro escape control-L, you can vary 
the speed of the copy to suit your taste. This fea- 
ture can also be used to copy long file names 
when loading programs; in any case, it's a big 
improvement over using the right arrow key 
and repeat. 

The macros included on the Macro-Seed 
disk are of varying usefulness. Some of them are 
frequently used Basic commands that might be 
handy to have "at your fingertips." Escape C, 
for instance, is catalog, a command that most 
programmers use more frequently than they 
bathe. On the other hand, most people prob- 
ably won't find much use for escape control-D, 
which prints out "Master Diskette." 

The whole idea behind macros, however, is 
that they are programmable. Thus, if you do a 
lot of complicated graphics programming and 
are forever looking up the pxjkes in appendix J of 
the Applesoft manual, you might want to set up 
macros for the ones you use the most. Or you 
could define a macro as print CHR$(4j;" for 
those ubiquitous DOS commands. 

Defining a macro is really quite easy. You 
simply use the Macro-Builder program on the

Editing a Line of Basic 



GPLE and Macro-Seed: Head to Head 



Suppose you are editing a Basic program. 
You have the line below, which is an input that 
asks you to select from one of two options. 



610 PRINT "LEFT (1) OR RIGHT (2)?' 

GET T$:T = VAL (T$): IF T<1 OR T>2 



THEN 605 



The line includes checks to ensure that an ille- 
gal response from the user doesn't crash the 
program. Now you wish to add a third option, 
center. This requires you to delete from point A, 
insert at point B, and replace a character at 
point C, making the line read 

610 PRINT "LEFT (1) RIGHT (2) OR CENTER 
(3)?";: GET T$:T = VAL (T$): IF T < 1 OR T 
<3 THEN 605 

Macro-Seed. Using Macro-Seed, the 
editing process would go like this: 

Escape IV 610 return — This lists line 
610 in thirty-three column mode, which 
eliminates the spaces between lines on the 
screen. It's necessary to do this because 
Macro-Seed, like Applesoft escape edit- 
ing requires that the line be copied by 
moving the cursor over it, and we don't 
want to copy extra spaces into printed 
output. The same effect can be achieved 
from Basic by typing poke 33,33 before 
listing the line. 

Five control-lVs and control-A — This 
sequence moves the cursor to the begin- 
ning of the line number without copying 
anything. It is the equivalent of Apple- 
soft's escape I I I I I J. Macro-Seed uses 
the W-A-S-Z diamond with the control 
key in place of the escape I-J-K-M 
diamond. 

Control-L and any key — When con- 
trol-L is hit, the cursor begins to move 
along the line, copying it into the input 
buffer, and stops when any key is hit. In 
this case you'll want to stop at posi- 
tion A. 

Three control-Ns — This sequence will 
delete "OR" from the line, moving the 
rest of the line back to fill the gap. 

Right arrow key with repeat — This is 
the easiest way to move the cursor the 
short distance to position B. 

Control-I — The line will split at the 
position of the cursor. The cursor and 
everything before it will scroll up one line, 
allowing space for more characters to be 
in,serted. 

OR CENTER fi^-This is the text to 
be in.serted. 

Control-T — The cursor tabs to the 
next nonspace character without copy- 



ing. This eliminates the extra spaces that 
control-I inserted. 

Control-L and any key — Again, this 
moves the cursor over the line, which is 
copied until the cursor is at position C, 
where you hit a key to stop it. If you miss 
the exact position desired, by the way, the 
arrow keys allow you to move to the 
right place. 

3 — Overwrites the "2" at position C 
with the desired "3." 

Control- Y return — This copies the re- 
mainder of the line into the input buffer 
and enters the corrected line. 

TEXT return — Finally, you'll want to 
return to normal forty-column mode to 
list or run the program. 
GPLE. If you want to make the same 
changes using GPLE, you would follow this 
sequence: 

Control-E 610 return— "Edit 610" 
will be printed to the screen, followed by 
the line, with the cursor at the beginning 
after the line number. In GPLE you 
needn't copy the line, so you don't have 
to move the cursor over the line number 
or over sections of the line you don't wish 
to change. 

Control-F O— The control-F com- 
mand means find; this command 
finds the first occurrence of the character 
"O," which happens to be position A. If 
you wanted to move to the second "O" 
in the line, you would have entered 
control-F O O. 

Three control-Ds — "OR " will be de- 
leted. 

Control-F ? — Moves the cursor to the 
first "?" character, which is position B, 
where you want to make an in- 
sertion. 

Control-I — You are now in insert 
mode. GPLEs insert mode works in the 
same way as the insert mode on most 
word processors. The text typed is placed 
at the cursor position, and the rest of the 
line moves out of the way to make room. 
Insert is exited by entering any other 
GPLE control command. 

OR CENTER (3)— The insertion. 

Control-F 2 — The cursor moves to 
position C. 

3 — The character "3" is typed over 
the character "2." 

Return — The line is entered into the 
program as it appears on the screen. 

As this example illustrates, GPLE s editor is 
somewhat easier to use than Macro-Seed's. It 
requires fewer keystrokes and a smaller com- 
mand vocabulary; and it's faster as well. Hi 



disk. You can list the current macros, decide 
which ones you can do without, and replace 
them with your own. The program keeps you 
informed about how much memory remains. 
Special characters for chaining macros are con- 
stantly displayed, and the manual describes how 
to include the return character and escape as 
well as those ASCII characters that aren't nor- 
mally available from the keyboard. 

Macro-Builder is in Applesoft, which means 
that when you run it, any program you're work- 
ing on will be lost. If you want to change a 
macro while programming without the hassle of 
having to save your program first, there is also a 
machine language program called Maero- 
Patcher that edits macro tables without clob- 
bering your program. 

GPLE. Where the author of Macro-S ced at- 
tempted to improve on the Apple escape edit- 
ing concept, GPLFs author has borrowed con- 
ventions from other computers' editors to make 
a more usable editing system. In fact, about five 
of GPLE's commands justify the purchase of 
the entire system. 

Designed with memor>' considerations at a 
lower priority than in Macro-Seed, GPLE, with 
editor and macro table, occupies more than five 
kilobytes of memory. With the 48K minimum 
required memory, 5K will hardly be noticed. If 
your programs are already hitting the upper 
reaches of memory, a RAM card wouldn't be a 
bad investment, and GPLE can help the invest- 
ment attain its full potential by moving DOS 
up, freeing the 8K it normally occupies for pro- 
gram use. 

Anyway, the extra memory GPLE occupies 
is put to good use. Its six easily remembered 
control commands make program editing easy. 
Typing control-E and a line number puts you in 
edit mode and calls the line to the screen. Con- 
trol-F followed by any character finds the first 
occurrence of that character and moves the cur- 
sor there. Repeating the character finds the next 
place the character appears. Any other charac- 
ter breaks you out of this find mode. This is the 
easiest way to move to the desired location in a 
long line, but it is not the only way. The arrows 
still work, of course, and control-B and con- 
trol-N go to the beginning and end of the line, 
respectively. 

Deleting a character works the same way in 
GPLE as it does in Macro-Seed, except that a 
different key is used. In GPLE, a control-D re- 
moves the character at the cursor and moves 
everything after the cursor back to fill in the 
space. Inserting in GPLE is much more sophis- 
ticated, however. Hitting control-I puts you in 
insert mode, in which anything you type in is 
placed at the cursor position, everything to the 
right of the cursor moves over, and the cursor 
position advances so you can insert another 
character. Any control command exits insert 
mode. For a detailed comparison of editing 
with GPLE and Macro-Seed, see the sidebar to 
this story, "Editing a Line of Basic." 

An option that is very useful and has no 
counterpart in Macro-Seed is the global search 
and replace. This is an extension of the control- 
E command. Instead of typing a single line

number after control-E, you type a pair of line 
numbers defining a range, followed by a pair of 
strings. This searches the range for all occur- 
rences of the first string and replaces them with 
the second string. If you leave out the hne num- 
bers, it searches the whole program. If you omit 
the replacement string, it allows you to edit all 
lines that contain the search string. The larger 
the programs you work with, the more essential 
this option becomes. 

GPLE calls its macros escape functions, but 
they work in exactly the same way. Each is a 
two-key sequence that takes the place of a com- 
mand or a number of commands. Because 
GPLE allots more than twice as much memory 
to macros than Macro-Seed does, the macros 
on the GPLE disk tend to be more powerful 
and useful. Escape 1 and escape 2 catalog drives 
one and two. Escape with 4, 5, or 6 selects the 
corresponding slot for a catalog. Among the 
more sophisticated macros offered are one to 
append one program (Applesoft or Integer) to 
another, one to print the number of free sectors 
on the last disk cataloged, and one to print the 
starting address and length of the last bloaded 
binary file. 

Like Macro-Seed, GPLE allows you to de- 
fine your own macros and save them to disk. 
But GPLE's macro-editing function is part 
of its regular editor, meaning it is constantly 
resident in memory; this ehminates the nui- 
sance of extra disk access. A macro, just like a 
line of Basic, is edited by typing control-E fol- 
lowed by escape and the macro name. 



The Routine Machine. A very recent addi- 
tion to the better Basic sweepstakes is Routine 
Machine from Southwestern Data Systems, 
which actually adds commands you thought 
you'd never be able to get on your Apple. A li- 
brary of thirty new commands is included with 
the Routine Machine disk, and SDS is also mar- 
keting a series of Ampersoft Program Library 
disks that contain even more commands to add 
to Basic. 

With Applesoft in ROM on most Apple II 
computers, the program's creators couldn't just 
append the extra commands onto the Apple- 
soft interpreter, so they did the next best thing. 
Commands are called with the ampersand 
hook, the name of the command, and a set of 
parameters. 

There are probably dozens of software 
packages available that use that technique to 
add extended sorting, graphics, or whatever rou- 
tines to Basic, so you're probably wondering 
what makes this one so special. Well, the fact is 
that no other program offers such a wide varie- 
ty of routines with such flexibihty. Some pack- 
ages give you a comprehensive library of extra 
commands, but they're all or nothing proposi- 
tions that occupy huge amounts of memory. 
With other packages, if you have an amper- 
sand sorting routine in memory, you can't have 
an ampersand graphics routine in at the same 
time. With Routine Machine you can. 

To use any of the available modules in one 
of your Basic programs, you first boot Routine 
Machine and select the modules you want. 



Thirty or more routines would take up a rather 
large amount of memory, so with Routine Ma- 
chine you load only the routines you need for 
any given job. When you exit to Basic, the mod- 
ules you chose are there in memory at the be- 
ginning of your program. You won't be able to 
see them, but when you save the program they'll 
save right along with it. When you load the pro- 
gram later on, you won't have to run Routine 
Machine again. The commands are there, ready 
for you to use. 

This makes these additional commands 
about as easy to implement as you could ask 
for. In addition, the Routine Machine program 
is capable of adding new modules to or remov- 
ing unused ones from an already complete pro- 
gram. If you can't remember what commands 
you added to a program you can take advan- 
tage of a report feature that tells you which 
modules have been appended and a memory 
map that shows how much space they occupy. 

The commands you can add are varied. One 
is the print using command. This command is 
common to a number of Basics but never made 
it to Applesoft. It allows highly sophisticated 
printout formatting. Numbers can be printed in 
columns, and commas can be added to large 
numbers to make them more readable. Spaces 
or asterisks can be concatenated onto the left 
side of the number. A number can be made to 
print out in time format (6:30), date format 
(12/25/82), or money format ($25,000.00). 

There is a bubble sort function for alphabe- 
tizing the elements of a single-dimensional 
string array. While it would be nice to be able to 
sort numerical or multidimensional arrays, a 
single-dimensional string array can be set up as 
an index to either of these, serving the same pur- 
pose. The manual gives suggestions for making 
the best possible use of this very fast sort. 

There are two sound routines offered. One 
simply generates musical notes of a given pitch 
and duration. The other operates on the pa- 
rameters pitch and shape and is used for mak- 
ing varied and interesting sound effects. 

In the category of graphics there is a pro- 
gram called Shape Gobbler that compiles stan- 
dard Apple shape tables into faster mnning ma- 
chine language routines that can be accessed by 
Routine Machine. There is also a turtle graphics 
module that provides complete turtle graphics 
capabilities from Basic. 

This is just a sampling of some of the most 
interesting of the routines available. Others are 
somewhat more specialized toward various pro- 
gramming functions. Whatever your program- 
ming needs, this package is definitely worth 
looking into.

Everyone's Guide to Assembly 
Language, Part 27 



In this month's column, we'll continue with our discussion of float- 
ing point number operations, begun last month. In November's article, 
we looked at how Applesoft uses the floating point accumulator (FAC) 
as the main register for most of its numeric operations. Routines were 
presented that demonstrated how data can be passed back and forth be- 
tween a running Applesoft program and a machine language subroutine 
and also how numeric data can be moved in and out of block memory 
storage. 

Using this foundation, we can now examine how to use Applesoft's 
routines for such basic math functions as addition, subtraction, multipli- 
cation, and division. 

A word of advice is in order, however, before proceeding. Your first 
inclination may be to think that the routines given here will enable you to 
do simple math operations with greater speed in an Applesoft program. 
As it happens, this will not directly produce the speed increase you want. 
Remember, Applesoft is already using these very same routines, and 
given that, no speed increase should be expected for such simple opera- 
tions as X = 5 * 10. 

Our new syntax will be: 

CALL 768,5, 10,X 

and as such involves just about as much overhead in the calling of the 
routine and the passing of data as would be involved in Applesoft. 

You may ask then, "Why use a machine language call for these 
operations?" 

There are a number of reasons, two of the more important of which 
follow. 

First, when dealing with programs that require a high degree of ac- 
curacy, integer data may not be sufficient. 

Suppose, for example, you have a program that simulates the motion 
of an object traveling in an elliptical (or other mathematically complex) 
path. 

If the current position of the object is continually maintained by 
using integer coordinates in the range of the normal screen coordinates, 
errors will begin to creep in with successive recalculations of position. 
This might be evidenced by the figure failing to retrace itself. Although in 
theory the object should always return to its starting point when follow- 
ing an elliptical path, multiple rounding errors may cause the object to 
"miss" its original starting point by a few screen units. 

A more reliable approach would be to maintain the current position 
in a true floating point format and round the number to the nearest in- 
teger prior to each plot. 

Secondly, calculations dealing with a large number of variables, or 
more specifically, with arrays of real variables, will be ocecuted faster by a 
machine language routine. 

If, for example, you wanted to multiply an entire array by 5, it would 
in fact be faster to employ a routine that used this syntax: 

CALL 768,A(0),5 
than to use: 

FOR 1 = 1 TO 100: A(l) = A(l) * 5: NEXT I 

These ideas and others are put to use in a number of commercial soft- 



ware products for the Apple. Many programs that require both speed 
and a high degree of accuracy use floating point representations of num- 
bers in machine language routines. Another common technique is to use 
the BCD (for "Binary Coded Decimal") format for the data. 

There are also programming utilities that provide machine language 
routines to be called directly from Applesoft. Routine Machine, Amper- 
Magic, Ampenvare, Apple Spice, and The Linker (published by South- 
western Data Systems, Anthro-Digital Software, Scientific Software 
Products, Adventure International, and Micro Lab, respectively) are all 
designed to allow the programmer access to useful routines written en- 
tirely in machine language. One product in particular, Ampersoft Pro- 
gram Library Vol. 1 (a Routine Machine-nlated package), deals almost 
entirely with array-related routines that use the advantages of the second 
principle mentioned to speed up array-related programs. 

In general, all these products are based on making use of the amper- 
sand vector to call specialized routines, the way we've discussed over the 
last year. And regardless of which package you prefer, it's safe to say that 
the overall idea of a user-selectable library of prewritten machine lan- 
guage routines easily called from Basic is one of the most powerful and 
exciting ideas to come along in Applesoft programming in the last few 
years. In fact, virtually all the routines presented over the last year are 
compatible with many of these ampersand utility packages. 

As a matter of reference, it should also be noted that techniques are 
available for faster numeric operations without having to call Applesoft 
routines. These range from arithmetic processor boards, such as those 
manufactured by California Computer Systems and others, to software 
subsystems such as Speed/ ASM (currently published by Sierra On-Line). 
A combination of both hardware and software is also available from Ap- 
plied Analytics, in the form of Micro-Speed, a Forth-like language com- 
bined with an arithmetic processor board. ALF Products offers an 8088 
processor card that includes software that speeds up Applesoft math 
functions. It also allows the calling of dedication math functions from a 
recurring machine language program, independent of Applesoft. 

More Applesoft Internals. Well, then, just how does a person use the 
existing routines in Applesoft? As with most things we've covered, the 
important thing to know is the addresses of the entry points to the Ap- 
plesoft routines for the basic math operations we're interested in. We al- 
so need to revive the discussion of the ARG (for "Argument") register, 
which we mentioned briefly last time. 

The ARG register is identical in format to the FAC and is used to 
hold the second number in floating point format when doing two-value 
functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The 
ARG register uses bytes $A5 through $AA. 

To see how ARG is used, consider these important entry points to 
Applesoft math routines:

HAS^N'T YOU HEARD 
OF THUNDERCLOCK PLUS ? 




If you want to put 
your Apple® to work — around the 
clock — Thunderclock Plus is the solution. Just plug it 
in and your programs can read the month, date, day of 
week and time — down to the second — in any of Apple's 
languages. So your Apple can do any number of tasks 
for you automatically. In the office, the lab or at home. 

Most good software packages for business, data base 
management, communications and time management 
are made to read Thunderclock Plus. (It's compatible 
with DB Master,* Micro-Courier** and VisiDex^, to 
name a few). So no matter how you use your Apple now, 
Thunderclock Plus can make it a more versatile 
and efficient tool. 

For example, with business or communi 
cations software, your Apple can auto- 
matically access a data base or send elec- 
tronic mail when the rates are lowest. 

In addition, Thunderclock Plus can 
organize your disk files. Our optional 
DOS-DATER™ software upgrades the 
regular DOS on your disks. So every 
time a program is saved or a file is modi- 
fied, the time and date, to the minute, 
are stored in the CATALOG with the file 
name. Now you can instantly know 
exactly when your files were last updated 




Thunderclock Plus 
can even give you a sense of 
security. Or just make your life a little easier. With our 
X-10 interface option and a BSR X-10* Home Control 
System, your Apple can turn on your lights, water your 
lawn . . .whatever you desire, according to schedules you 
create. It comes with our menu-driven SCHEDULER 
software. So it's easy to design and modify schedules 
that can run in the "background" while you have 
"hands-on" use of your Apple. 

Thunderclock Plus comes with a one-year warranty. 
Powered by on-board batteries, it runs accurately for up 
to four years without battery replacement. 
So now that you've heard of Thunderclock Plus, isn't 
it time you put your Apple to work — 
around the clock? See your dealer 
for a demonstration or contact us.

For the first column of labels, the addresses given show the entry 
point for the routines that will perform the given function between the 
ARG register and the FAC. For example, a call to FSUBT ($E7AA) 
would subtract the contents of the FAC from the contents of the ARG. 
The result would be left in the FAC. 

Prior to calling any of these four routines, the accumulator must be 
loaded with the exponent value of the FAC (FACEXP = $9D). This al- 
so serves to condition the zero flag. For example, to multiply FAC times 
ARG, the following code could be used 

LDA $9D 
JSR $E982 

The second column of labels refers to the routines used to perform 
the indicated function between the FAC and data stored in memory 
(such as in a real variable) or in a data block set up by the programmer. 

To use these, the Y register and accumulator must be set up with the 
address of the memory location holding the numeric data (Y,A = high 
byte, low byte). When a routine is called, the data pointed to by YA will 
then be transferred into ARG and the direct function routine (first col- 
umn) then called. 

An Example That Doesn't Work. You may wonder why a sample 
listing that doesn't work is included here. The reason is that this listing 
does present, in a clear way, an overall example of what we've been dis- 
cussing in this issue and the previous one. It will also help you under- 
stand the changes we'll be making later on in order to create a routine 
that does work! 

From Applesoft, the routine would be called from a program like 

this: 

10 INPUT"X1,X2:";X1,X2 

20 CALL 768,X1,X2,RSLT 

30 PRINT X1;" + ";X2;" = ";RSLT 

Where XI and X2 are the two arguments for the addition routine, that 
routine will be called. The result of the calculation will be sent back to the 
Applesoft program into the variable RSLT. 
Here's the listing for the addition routine:

suit in the FAC. Since we will want the first argument in the ARG regis- 
ter, MOVAF ($EB63 = "Move to ARG from FAC") is then used to 
move the data. 

Line 25 again calls CHKCOM to "gobble" the next comma, after 
which FRMNUM is again used to evaluate the next value and place it in 
the FAC. 

We would now expect the result to be in the FAC. Line 31 takes care 
of the third comma, after which PTRGET ($DFE3) finds (or creates) 
the variable in which we want the result returned. 

At this point, everything has been properly placed for the use of the 
FADDT routine to add the FAC and ARG registers together. Line 28 
loads the accumulator with FACEXP ($9D) as the entry requirement for 
the next instruction, which is the actual execufion of the FADDT 
routine. 

The TAX on line 33 is used after PTRGET to move the low-order 
byte of the variable data address into the X register, after which 
MOVMF ($EB2B = "Move to Memory from FAC") is used to com- 
plete the data transfer. 

Note: If you're unfamiliar with the fundamental move routines, you 
may wish to go back to November's column, which covered these sup- 
porting routines. 

The nice part about this routine is how easily the setup for the addi- 
tion routine was accomplished. With a little thought, though, you may 
realize this is to be expected. After all, the internal routines were created 
in the first place to process data easily within an Applesoft program. 

Why It Doesn't Work. The routine fails because of FRMNUM. Al- 
though it was mentioned that FRMNUM leaves its result in FAC, what 
you weren't let in on was the fact that it also uses ARG during its calcu- 
lations. This means that when we call FRMNUM a second time on line 
26, we are unknowingly destroying the value we set up in ARG in lines 
22 and 23. 

The solution, then, is to save the FAC contents from the first value 
calculation in memory at a place other than ARG. 

There are two alternatives. The first is to use some of Applesoft's 
own temporary numeric registers, which are called, cleverly enough, 
TEMPI ($93-97), TEMP2($98-9C), and TEMP3($8A-8E). The only 
risk here is in the destruction of data later on by other temporary calcu- 
lations by FRMNUM and FRMEVL ($DD7B). 

Another possibility would be to set aside our own temporary storage 
area. For this next example, we'll do that, using the last half of the input 
buffer, $280-284. 

Here's the revised listing, called using the same Applesoft program as 
before:

You'll notice in this listing that lines 23 and 24 set up the Y and X 
registers for the subsequent call to MOVMF. This stores the data for the 
first value safely in memory. 

The word "safely" is used with certain caveats. The input buffer is a 
useful area in which to store temporary data, but you should be aware of 
the kinds of conditions that will overwrite data placed there. DOS com- 
mands and input statements are the most likely threats. Also, com- 
mands executed from the immediate mode can overwrite the input buff- 
er. This is in fact why we used $280-284 for the temporary register. This 
allows you to try the routine from the immediate mode, since you are un- 
likely to use more than 1 27 characters as your command line when test- 
ing the routine. 

Once the data is stored off in memory, hne 28 evaluates the next 
value, leaving the result in the FAC. At this point we use another rou- 
tine, CONUPK ($E9E3), to move the data from $280-284 back to 
ARG. Remember, this is necessary because FRMNUM on line 28 
makes it impossible to store the value for XI in ARG. 

After CONUPK puts the data back in ARG, FADDT ($E7C1) is 
used to do the addition of FAC and ARG. 

A Little More Finesse. In the chart showing the various math rou- 
tine entry points, you'll remember that there was a set of routines that al- 
low for dealing with data in memory directly. We can use these to create 
a slightly smaller version of the previous program, which will eliminate 
our having to load ARG directly prior to calling FADDT.

The only difference between this routine and the previous one is that 
line 30 now sets up the Y and A registers for a direct call to FADD 
($E7BE). This entry point automatically transfers the contents of 
$280-284 to ARG and then "falls into" FADDT ($E7C1). 

Other Operations: Subtraction, Multiplication, and So On. Creating 
routines to do the other three functions is very simple. Rewriting lines 18 
and 32 of the improved listing to use FSUB ($E7A7), FMULT ($E97F), 
and FDIV ($EA66) will create the routines to perform the correspond- 
ing functions. 

As it happens, there's also a variety of other simple functions that can 
be performed on the FAC with a single 'JSR'. A brief list is presented in 

table 1. 

Information like what's given in table 1 is quite valuable, if not indis- 
pensable, when you're writing your own machine language routines that 
use Applesoft. There are a few notable sources for such information. The 
first is in an article by John Crossley of Apple Computer called "Apple- 
soft Internal Entry Points," which has been reprinted in a number of 
places including /4/7p/e Orchard, Call-A.P.P.L.E. and Call-A.P.P.LE. 
In Depth #/. 

There is also a book called What's Where in the Apple?hy William F. 
Luebbert that lists many of the entry points to not only Applesoft but to 
the Monitor, DOS, Integer Basic, and more. 

Conclusion. In summary, then, we have seen how the FAC and 
ARG registers are used as the central points in almost all of Applesoft's 
numeric calculations. In addition (no pun intended), we have seen how 
the individual math routines are called to perform the desired functions. 

These new routines should be very useful in creating your own float- 
ing point utilities. You may wish to try to create a routine to perform a 
simple function on an entire array as an exercise in using these new tech- 
niques. 

Until next month, then, happy Appling!

Jones: "Mr. Dow, look what they're selling in that new store 

down the street: Dow Jones Software. You haven't gotten 
us into ladies' fashions, have you?" 

Dow: "No, Mr. Jones. That's a computer store, and our software 
products allow investors and business professionals to use 
a personal computer like this one here to easily manage 
financial information." 

Jones: "But what about our reputation? We've been leaders in ■ 
serving the business and financial community for over 100 
years. Are you sure this new software will be as reliable as 
The Wall Street Journal and Barron's?" 

Dow: "Of course, Jones. Our software is so reliable we back it up 
with a full-year warranty. People trust Dow Jones Software 
the same way they trust the Journal. And we have a toll- 
free Hotline number in case they want expert help." 

Jones: "Couldn't that be a lot of phone calls? After all, we've got 
the Dow Jones Averages to get out every day." 

Dow: "Don't worry, Jones. Our software is very easy to use, and 
we have a fully staffed Customer Service Department to 



respond to our dealers and customers." 
Jones: "Just what can our software do?" 

Dow: "In a nutshell, Jones, with a personal computer, a tele- 
phone, a modem and Dow Jones Software, you can easily 
perform complex analyses on the information available 
from our information service, Dow Jones News/Retrieval®."

...Bank on it. 




The most basic requirement of any investor is a system for keeping 
track of his or her market activity, including purchases, sales, short sales, 
the remaining life of a put or call, and, last but not least, profit 
calculations. 

One of the first portfolio accounting programs written for the Apple is 
Portfolio Master by James M. Huebner. In its original 1978 form, the 
program was titled Portfolio Review. The first version of Portfolio Mas- 
ter was introduced in 1979. 

Portfolio Master is considered by many to be the granddaddy of 
portfolio accounting programs. Because of the program's age and per- 
formance, computer dealers who are investment-minded and Apple 
computer- equipped investors consider it the standard by which all other 
such programs should be judged. We'll take a good look at Portfolio 
Master now. 

Portfolio Master, Investors Software (Box 2605, San Francisco, CA 
94126; 415-981-5261). $195. 

Back-up policy: One free disk with registration; $25 plus return of de- 
fective disk for each additional back-up. 

System requirements: 48K Apple II Plus with two disk drives; print- 
er recommended; Hayes Micromodem II optional. 

Initially, the program requires that the investor set the program pa- 
rameters. These parameters consist of the slot number in which the print- 
er interface is located, any control characters that may be required by the 
printer, the number of line feeds the investor wishes to send to the printer 
(zero to two), the local access numbers and password for Dow Jones (if a 
modem m\\ be used to retrieve stock quotes), the modem slot number, 
and the maximum number of securities to be held in the portfolio (or the 
maximum number of sales the user thinks he may have, referred to as 
the maximum number of line items). 

The smaller the portfolio size, the faster the I/O operations per- 
formed by the disk will be. Be careful not to overestimate substantially 
the number of line items (portfolio size); doing so will lead to long waiting pe- 
riods during disk input/output operations. 

Once all of the parameter questions have been answered, the pro- 
gram writes a parameter file to the disk. It's not necessary to redo this 
procedure each time unless you need to change some of the information 
supplied. This would be required if the local Dow Jones access numbers 
were changed, or if you were to use a printer different from the one used 
when the parameters were set. 

To begin using Portfolio Master, the investor is prompted to supply 
the name of the portfolio that will be the subject of the current session's 
processing. Once the name has been entered, the program prompts for a 
Y or N response: is the name correct? If your reply is no, you're prompt- 
ed to reenter the name; if your response is yes, the main menu is 
displayed. 

If there is no portfolio data in memory, the program displays a flash- 
ing question mark next to menu choice number 4 — "input portfolio 
from disk." 

It's then possible to load an existing portfolio from the disk or to cre- 



ate a new portfolio using the enter/delete module. 

Assuming that we load an existing portfolio from the disk, an in- 
verse status marker will appear in the upper right-hand corner of the 
screen; it simply states "OK." "OK" indicates that the portfolio has been 
satisfactorily loaded into the Apple's memory and that the program is 
ready to go forward. Choice number 9 on the menu, "save portfolio to 
disk," will be displayed in inverse video from this point on. This is a re- 
minder that the current portfolio file should be saved to disk before the 
session is terminated. If this is not done, all calculations, changes, up- 
dates, and deletions performed on the portfolio will disappear when the 
system is shut off. This is, of course, a very good point to remember 
when using any program. If something is in memory and not saved to the 
disk, power-ofi" means data good-bye. 

Menu selection number one on the display/print menu gives the in- 
vestor a portfolio listing. The date of the last update to the portfolio is 
displayed at the top of the screen. The percentage of each holding rela- 
tive to the total value of the portfolio is displayed in the column headed 
%WGT. The %WGT calculation highlights the areas of the portfolio 
where risk may be concentrated based on the volatility of the securities in 
your portfolio. 

The various classes of securities are flagged using standard termi- 
nology C for call options, P for puts, R for rights, W for warrants, S for 
short sales, B for bonds, and E for expired options, rights or warrants. 
The flags are automatically assigned by the program when you enter the 
security. The program puts a seven-character limit on names of securi- 
ties: Commodore would be displayed as Commodo. 

Portfolio Master always lists the components of a portfolio in the fol- 
lowing order: common stock, preferred stock, calls, puts, rights, war- 
rants, short sales, bonds, t-bills, and cash. Within each security type, the 
holdings are arranged in alphabetical order. If you've made multiple pur- 
chases of the same security, they will be displayed in date order, with the 
most recent purchase listed first. 

The program values short positions by extending the current price of 
the position. This may or may not be the true value of the holding. 
The %WGT of the position is correctly weighted for the short position 
against the balance of the portfolio. The correct current value of the 
short position is available in another table that the user has access to. 
This is the portfolio profit or loss table. 

The program automatically begins flashing the code flag of an op- 
tion, right, or warrant nine days before it is scheduled to expire. After ex- 
piration, the flag changes to an E and continues to flash. This is a val- 
uable tool, since the flashing signal brings these expiring instruments to 
your attention before it's too late. 

The second option on the print/display menu is a portfolio by cate- 
gory listing. The total holdings by security type — that is, common stock, 
preferred stock, and so on — will be displayed, totaled, and weighted rela- 
tive to the entire portfolio. 

The portfolio profit and loss table is choice number 3 on the print 
display menu. The cost of each holding and its price on the last update

are displayed. Gains and losses are automatically computed. The pro- 
gram indicates in the last two columns whether the position is long or 
short. Long and short-term gains or losses are totaled at the bottom of 
the appropriate column. The portfolio's overall net gain or loss is also 
calculated. 

A basis table is created by choice number 4 on the print /display 
menu. The table shows the price per security and the date of purchase. 
Short sales are reflected by showing the date the security was sold short 
and the sales price. 

Choice 5 creates a sales table. The sales table allows you to keep track 
of the securities sold and the short positions that have been covered. The 
information displayed is the name of the security, the selling price, the 
date of sale, the basis, and whether it was a long or short-term gain or 
loss. At the end of the listing, the net realized gain or loss generated by 
selling from the portfolio is calculated and displayed. 

A maturity and expiration table for options, rights, warrants, and 
t-bills is available through choice number 6 on the print display menu. 
This table allows an investor to see at a glance the relevant dates for the 
time-sensitive components of the portfolio. 

Choice 7 on the menu shows portfolio descriptions. These descrip- 
tions are the full names of the companies in the portfolio. The progam 
limits them to a maximum of twenty-five characters. 

Choice number 8 allows you to print any of the tables we've men- 
tioned. The program prompts you to check the condition of the printer 
and to select the table to be printed. 

If you choose to print out your reports in eighty-column format, the 
program will take tables that were generated separately in forty-column 
mode and combine them into an eighty-column report. The portfolio 
listing report will be a combination of the portfolio listing, portfolio 
profit and loss, and the basis tables. The sales table is transformed into a 
schedule of capital gains and losses. 

The reports available through the print/display menu form the back- 
bone of Portfolio Master. All of the other modules are designed to han- 
dle the information requirements of this section. Even though the im- 
portance of these other sections may not be immediately evident, their 
ease of use and efficiency greatly enhance Portfolio Master's usefulness. 

The update module allows an investor to update prices of securities 
and to reflect recent sales or purchases. When purchases or sales are en- 
tered through this module, they're reflected in the cash balance main- 
tained by the program. 

All securities are carried at the actual reported value with the excep- 
tion of t-bills, which are carried at their face or maturity value. 

When updating, you may choose to update individual securities or all 
securities. When an item is updated, the last price entered is displayed. 
The program requires that fractional prices be entered in decimal form. 
Even though most newspapers and financial publications list prices in 
fractions, the division required to convert fractions to decimals is not dif- 
ficult or time-consuming. After a while, you'll be able to perform the 
conversions mentally. 

When entering a purchase, an investor is prompted to check the port- 
folio name. If the correct portfolio is being updated, the investor responds 
by hitting Y and continues. If not, the name of the correct portfolio is en- 
tered, and the program prepares that portfolio for updating. 

The program presents a list on the screen of all the types of securities 
that the program accounts for. You choose which security you're enter- 
ing, that is, common stock, preferred stock, short sale, and so on. Port- 
folio Master then displays an entry menu that requires you to supply 
such information as the number of shares or units purchased, ticker sym- 
bol, description, current price, the cost of the security per share, total 
cost, and purchase date. 

The program calculates the cost per share by dividing the number of 
units by the total cost, so it's not necessary for an investor to supply cost- 
per-share information. To make corrections, you'd answer no to the 
prompt "all correct." This places the cursor at the top of the screen. 
Pressing the return key moves the cursor from item to item. Once the 
correction is made, the cursor is moved to the "all correct" line and a Y 
is inserted for yes. A C (for cancel input) can be used to undo the entry. 

After all updates have been entered. Portfolio Master loads its sort- 
ing routine and the portfolio is sorted. The sort arranges the portfolio 



first by type of security and then alphabetically within that type. 

Once a security is part of a portfolio, its sale is reflected by entering 
the transaction's information through the current sales function. 

The proceeds of the sale, whether it results in a profit or a loss, are re- 
flected in the cash balance maintained by the portfolio. 

Securities can be added or deleted without affecting the cash balance 
reporting of Portfolio Master. This is accomplished through the use of 
the enter/delete menu. The sales table may also be adjusted through this 
function without affecting the cash balance. An investor might use this 
function when the securities in question are being held in some form of 
stewardship; in such a case, the cash value of the securities would not be- 
long to the investor and should not be accounted for as part of the 
portfolio. 

Portfolio Master can also handle stock splits and stock dividends. Af- 
ter you enter the required information, the program automatically ad- 
justs the number of shares, the cost price, and the current value. This 
module also handles splits for calls, puts, rights, and warrants. Portfolio 
Master allows you to delete the entire sales table at the end of a year and 
start a new one. This is advantageous for tax reporting purposes and is a 
great help. 

The Dow Jones Retrieval Service module allows you to update your 
portfolio automatically, using the Dow Jones database. All quotes, ex- 
cept for those on rights and United States Government bonds which are 
presently not supported by Portfolio Master, are fetched. 

Portfolio Master was written by James Huebner, who has been in- 
volved in investment management for more than twenty years. Portfolio 
Master reflects his years of experience, skill, and dedication. 

The program is excellently documented, and Huebner is more than 
willing to help users over the phone. His patience and understanding are 
almost legendary among users of the program. 

These credentials would be difficult to argue with. Portfolio Master is 
easy to use, well documented, well supported, and reasonably priced. It is 
heartily recommended to any investor who needs a portfolio accounting 
program.

GRAPH 



C A L L y SPEAK 





by I e r k P e I c z o r s U 



This time around, we're going to continue our experimenting with as- 
sembly language graphics by taking the Basic character generator from 
two issues ago and the start of a machine language character from last is- 
sue and finish writing a real machine language character graphics gener- 
ator. Actually, this particular article turns out to be much more about as- 
sembly language than graphics itself, but to do fast graphics you have to 
know some of the tricks to doing them quickly. Playing with some fast 
graphics routines also happens to be a nice, visual way to learn some as- 
sembly language. This column isn't going to be about assembly lan- 
guage all the time, however; in the future we'll look at types of tools 
available for those who don't have the time to tinker with machine lan- 
guage. But for now, on to the accumulator, the X and Y register, and 
hexadecimal addressing. . . . 

When we last left off, we'd written a little routine that, given an X 
and Y screen value, would find the address of the Y line in memory from 
a look-up table we created, then, using what's called indirect indexed ad- 
dressing, put the value $FF in the screen location we'd sf)ecified. The in- 
direct addressing happened when we stored the address of the beginning 
of the screen line in a pair of locations, TEMPLO and TEMPHI, then 
loaded the X offset on the screen into the Y register and used the com- 
mand 

STA (TEMPLO),Y 

The parentheses around TEMPLO meant that the computer should find 
the address stored in TEMPLO and the following location (which we 
named TEMPHI) and add the contents of the Y register to that to get 
the final address to store something in. 

In the process, we also used absolute indexed addressing to get num- 
bers out of our look-up table, with commands like: 

LDA LOOKLO.Y 

Without parentheses, it means to take the address LOOKLO and add 
the contents of the Y register to get the final address. 

Note the differences between the two types of indexed addressing we 
used. Both give you something like an array in Basic, but the absolute in- 
dexed (the one without parentheses) uses the exact value of the address 
you specify plus Y. Indirect indexed finds the address stored in the loca- 
tion you give, then adds Y. 

Why these two types? Because the Y register is only one byte, and it 
can contain only the values 0 to 255. So with either addressing mode, 
your "array" can contain only 256 numbers. But, with the indirect in- 
dexed, we can change the base address. Going back to the short routine 
from last month, we couldn't index 8,192 bytes of a hi-res screen with on- 
ly the Y register. But we could index a single line on the screen, because 
it's only forty bytes long. We wouldn't want 192 labels and 192 different 
plot routines, one for each line on the screen, though. So we compute the 
base address of each line (actually use the look-up table) and put that in a 



location that we use for indirect indexing from only one routine. The on- 
ly restrirtions of indirect indexed addressing are that the location where 
you put the address must be on page zero ($00 through $FF), must start 
on an even address (we used $06), and must be in low, high format (in a 
four-digit address, such as $12CD, the right digits, $CD, go in the first 
byte, and the left digits, $12, go in the second byte). 

All terribly confusing (at least when you first try to learn it), but once 
you grasp that, the rest of assembly language is pretty easy. 

Okay, Let's Tackle Another Routine Time. Instead of putting only 
one byte on the screen at a time, we'll take our Basic character generator 
and convert it to machine language so that we can put any of 128 char- 
acters on the screen. Each character is eight bytes: one byte wide (seven 
dots) and eight bytes tall. Before, we had the character definitions stored 
in a Basic array. Now, we'll store them in a binary table, and we'll load 
each byte using indirect indexed addressing (128 characters multiplied by 
eight bytes each gives 1 ,024 bytes; too much for using absolute indexed). 

To start, we'll create a character table using the program in listing 1 . 

290 REM THIS CREATES PART OF A CHARACTER DEFINITION 

TABLE, FROM ASCII 65 TO 67 
310 FOR I = 65 TO 67 
320 FOR J = 0 TO 7 
330 READ V: POKE 28672 + 8 * I + J,V 
340 NEXT J: NEXT I 

345 PRINT CHR$ (4);"BSAVE CHARTABLE,A$7000,L$1 00": END 
350 DATA 8,20,34,34,62,34,34,0 
360 DATA 30,34,34,30,34,34,30,0 
370 DATA 28,34,2,2,2,34,28,0 

Listing 1. 

You may notice that most of it is taken directly from the last program 
two issues ago, except that instead of storing in an array, we're poking in- 
to memory. We'll put the table at $7000, or 28,672 decimal. The letters 
A, B, and C, which are the three we defined, have ASCII values 65, 66, 
and 67. (ASCII is the standard character-to-number translation used by 
most computers. Page 138, Appendix K, in an active programmer's Ap- 
plesoft manual can become quite worn. That's where they have the table 
listed.) Anyway, each character takes eight bytes, so to find the first byte 
of the nth character, you would look in 28,672 + 8 * n. That's where the 
poke address in the program comes from. 

This program only has three character definitions. Others are left to 
you, using the technique from a couple issues back. Of course there are 
short cuts. If you have the DOS Tool Kit, Higher Text, or Complete 
Graphics System, the small character sets from all of those use the same 
format. In listing 3, where we actually use our finished routine from Ba- 
sic, you can substitute a bload of any small character set at location 
$7000 (because some of them do not use the first thirty-two characters, 
try bloading at $7100 if the letters don't match up).

After storing a character table on your disk, either with listing 1 or 
through other means, you're ready to do the assembly language routine. 
See listing 2. We'll go through it step by step.

Listing 2. 



The first eleven lines should look familiar from the last issue. We 
added a few extra equates (EQU) and a new define byte (DFB), but the 
rest is the same. The routine will originate (ORG) at $6000. We'll use two 
pairs of zero-page addresses for indirect indexing: TEMPLO and 
TEMPHI for the screen line addresses taken from the look-up table and 
CTABLO and CTABHI for addressing the character table. LOOKHI 
and LOOKLO, the pointers to the look-up table, are the same as before. 
CHRTAB is the pointer to the beginning of the character table. 

CHAR is where we will put the ASCII value of the character we 
want printed. XVALUE and YVALUE are the X,Y location to print on 
the screen, as before. 

Before proceeding, note that this routine was written with the assem- 
bler in the DOS Tool Kit. Some of the conventions differ with other as- 
semblers, and we'll try to point out the differences. Also, if you are really 
interested in pursuing even a small amount of assembly language pro- 
gramming, invest in an assembler and in some type of reference book 
that has a chart of the 6502 assembly language commands. Otherwise it's 
going to seem like all these commands are being pulled out of a hat, 
made up as we go. There are fifty-five commands, but many are 
seldom used. 

Okay. The beginning of the program loads the address CHRTAB in- 
to the accumulator, half at a time, and stores it in CTABLO and 
CTABHI. The symbol #>CHRTAB means a number, the low byte of 
the address CHRTAB. The number #<CHRTAB is the high byte of the 
address. At the far left, you see the hex numbers that are generated when 
the code is assembled. Note that at $6003, you get the values A9 00. A9 is 
the LDA code, and 00 is the value given #> CHRTAB. Two lines down, 
you get A9 70; again, the LDA code and then #< CHRTAB. In the be- 
ginning you equated CHRTAB with $7000, which is where 00 and 70 
come from. The nice thing is you don't worry much about the numbers 
generated; the assembler does that for you. 

Note: The # > and # < format varies with assanblers. If all else fails, 
do two equates for the address, something like:

and use those in place of #<CHRTAB and #>CHRTAB. 

A Little Multiplication and Division by Powers of Two. The next 
part may be tricky. What we're trying to do is get CTABLO and 
CTABHI to point to the beginning of the letter we want. Now it just 
points to the beginning of a 1,024 ($400) byte table. A page of memory 
(not related to hi-res pages) is 256 ($100) bytes. The high byte of any ad- 
dress gives its page number in memory. The character table takes four 
pages ($400 bytes). Each page holds thirty-two characters (256/8 bytes = 
32 characters), so CTABHI should be $70 if the character number is 0 to 
3 1 , $7 1 if the code is 32 to 63, $72 if the code is 64 to 95, or $73 if it's 96 to 
127. It's $70 now; we have to add to that the character code divided by 
thirty-two. 

Similarly, the low byte should point to where in that 256-byte page 
the eight bytes for the letter starts. To do that, we need the remainder af- 
ter dividing the character code by thirty-two (that is, which character is it 
of thirty-two on that page?), multiplied by eight. 

For example, say we want character 36. Character 36 would be on 
the second page of the character table; the characters 0-31 are from 
$7000 to $70FF. Thirty-six divided by thirty-two is one, with a re- 
mainder of four. The page number that character 36 is on is $70 -I- 1, or 
$71 . Furthermore, it is character 4 on that page (32, 33, 34, 35, and 36 are 
characters 0 to 4, and so on, on memory page $71). Since each character 
is eight bytes long, the definition for character 36 starts at byte 32 of that 
page (eight times four). 

. Now come the three tricky commands. LSR stands for logical shift 
right. It takes all the bits in a byte and moves them to the right one place. 
The rightmost bit gets thrown away (although you can find it, if you need 
it). The effect of this is dividing by two and throwing away the remain- 
der! Examples (with four bits):

By doing two LSRs in a row, it's like dividing by four. With three, it's di- 
viding by eight. And with five, it's dividing by thirty-two. That's why the 
next six lines of the listing load the character number and then do five 
LSRs. 

Similarly, ASL is arithmetic shift left. It does about the same thing, 
but in the other direction. It's equivalent to multiplying by two. More 
than one sequence allows you to multiply by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on. A few 
lines down, when we need to multiply by eight, you see three ASLs. 

AND is a logical and operation. If you remember some logic opera- 
tions from high school, with and you get true as a result only if the two 
things you are performing an and on are also true. In binary, trues are 
ones. To show you how it works: 

10110 
and 00111 



00110 



Notice that only when both corresponding bits are set will the same bit in 
the result be set. 

There is also an or command and an exclusive or command, and all 
three of these logic operators are extremely useful with graphics. For 
now, though, we're using AND as a short way to find the remainder of a 
division by thirty-two. Line 26 in the listing has an A ND j^lF. $1F is 31 
decimal, or 0001 1111 in binary. Performing an and on it with any num- 
ber gives the remainder of a division by thirty-two. The left three bits in 
the byte would give the result of the division. Try it with a few numbers. 

Back to the program. The five LSRs all affect the accumulator. Most 
assemblers accept LSR by itself as meaning that the accumulator is used. 
The DOS Tool Kit assembler requires the operand A to specify accumu-

lator. Depending on' the assembler you use, you may have to omit the A. 

After the LSRs is a clear carry (CLC). There is one bit called the car- 
ry bit that holds the carry for any addition. That allows numbers larger 
than 255 to be used in arithmetic. It is also used in other operations, such 
as subtraction, and it is where the chopped-off bits in LSRs and ASLs get 
"thrown away." Since the next step is an addition, we don't want any 
junk messing up the addition operation, so clear carry sets the carry bit 
to zero. 

ADC is add with carry. It adds the number pointed to, in this case 
CTABHI, to the accumulator. Then we store the result (STA), which is 
in the accumulator, back in CTABHI. CTABHI now points to the cor- 
rect page for the character we want. 

In the next two lines we load the character number again and then 
use AND to find the remainder of a division by thirty-two. Then the 
three ASLs multiply by eight, and we have the offset on the page for the 
letter we want. So we use CLC again, and add this offset to CTABLO, 
storing the result back in CTABLO. 

Note: Again, for ASL, the A operator isn't used by all assemblers. 
Also, in our example, we started the table on a page boundary, $7000. 
We could have omitted this last addition and a couple of other steps be- 
cause we are just adding to zero. The routine is more generalized this 
way, although at some later time you could put your table anywhere you 
want in memory, if need be. The only change you'd have to make is in 
the equate at the beginning. 

Now for a loop. We have eight bytes to put on the screen, and 
CTABLO/CTABHI points to the first of these. For fun, we'll use theX 
register as a counter, from 0 to 7 (stopping when it reaches 8). LDX #0 
does what you probably think: loads the X register with the number zero. 

The first five lines in the loop you should recognize. They are still 
here from the short routine last month. We take the Y value, find the ad- 
dress of the start of that line in our look-up table, and put that address in 
TEMPLO/TEMPHI. Next we do a similar thing to get the first (or next) 
byte of our character. The X register is our counter. TXA transfers from 
X to A. TAY transfers from A to Y. (There is no TXY; too bad.) We 
transferred our counter to the Y register because it's the Y register that 
must be used for indirect indexed addressing. So we use it to get the byte 
for our character in line 41 . The next two lines are alsoTrom our first rou- 
tine last month; they store the accumulator value on the screen at the 
proper X offset. 

That being done, we increment (INC) YVALUE (add one to it) so 
that the next byte will go one Une down. Simple. Then we increment the 
X register with the INX command. Okay. Then we compare X to the 
number 8 (CPX #8) and branch to LOOP if they are not the same (BNE 
is branch if not equal) and repeat the process. If the comparison was 
equal, the program continues on the next line, which is an RTS (return 
from subroutine), sending control back to Basic. 

Done! 

Finally, there's listing 3, which is a Basic program that bloads the 
three binary files we need, gets a starting X,Y location, and loops 
through the process of getting a key, poking the ASCII value of the char- 
acter and the X and Y values into the memory locations of the plot rou- 
tine and calling the routine. Compare listing 3 to listing 6 from two is- 
sues ago. Same program, with the graphics changed to machine lan- 
guage. Remember, though, that unless you added your own characters, 
the only letters that will make sense on the screen are A, B, and C. We 
didn't define any others. We can't do everything here. . . .

Come with us aboard the Swine Trek, as we find the glamorous First 
Mate Piggy getting ready to study for her final exam in galactic history. 
Captain Link Hogthrob is saying, " Well, First Mate Piggy, are you sure 
you wish to go through with this? It is the toughest exam in the galaxy." 

"Let me tell you," replies the first mate, "if that old porker over there 
can be a doctor, so can I! I'll be the first woman to get a galactic Ph.D. 
(Doctor of Pig-headedness}, and then we'll see who's boss around here!" 

"Okay, if you insist," says the captain. "Dr. Strangepork, please pre- 
pare the pertinent past periods for Piggy's perusal." 

Dr. Strangepork fusses with a strange glowing machine for a moment 
then invites Piggy over. "Step right this way. First Mate Piggy. Here is one 
of my finest inventions — the Vault of Ages, otherwise known as the Larder 
of History." 

As First Mate Piggy sits down before the multicolored sphere, she 
squeals, "Why, it looks like an apple! All right, who took a bite out of it?" 

"No, no," Dr. Strangepork replies hastily, "that is the recessed viewing 
screen. Now sit here, and all of Muppet history will be cast before your 
pearly eyes. Afterward, you'll be given a comprehensive, profound examina- 
tion. To answer, you'll have to probe the very foundations of the universe. If 
you succeed, you'll go down in the annals of history alongside those great 
immortals: Sir Francis Bacon, Oscar Mayer, and Jimmy Dean. 

"Good luck; you'll need it!" 

The screen lights up with the standard, Lucas-style, thundering title. 
The Rise and Rise of the Henson Empire. While antique kinescope pic- 
tures flash before her eyes. First Mate Piggy listens to the narrative. 

It was in 1954 that "Sam and Friends" first aired on WRC-TV in 
Washington, DC. Featuring Sam, Yorick, Mushmelon, and Kermit, this 
ground-breaicing show ran for eight long years, receiving a local Emmy 
in 1958. 

The show's characters sprang from the creative geniuses of Jim Hen- 
son and Jane Nebel, fellow students at the University of Maryland. Hen- 
son, then a sophomore, christened the troupe "The Muppets." 

Performing in clubs and coffeehouses, the Muppets were an under- 
ground hit among college students. As Michael Frith, now vice presi- 
dent of art and design for Henson Associates, recalls, "The original 
Muppets were adult entertainment. It was not until much later that any- 
one thought of using them for children's programming." 

How To Marry a Muppetaire. The next year, Henson and Nebel 
turned their collaboration into commitment; they married. 

Meanwhile, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. . . . 



Fresh from their years together at Connecticut's Deerfield Academy, 
Michael Frith and Christopher Cerf arrived at Harvard. The two friends 
promptly joined the staff of the infamous Harvard Lampoon, rising to the 
offices of president (Frith) and vice president (CerQ. 

Many years later, Lisa Henson, one of Jim and Jane's daughters, 
would become the magazine's first female president. 

Joining Jim Henson in 1961, Don Sahlin became one of the prime 
movers of the group. For the next twelve years, Sahlin built practically all 
the Muppets. Henson sketched ideas and Sahlin "fleshed them out." 

Sahlin gave the Muppets their unique facial look; he created the 
"magic triangle." When the eyes, nose, and mouth are placed just right, 
the Muppet's face is centrally focused for the viewer, making the Mup- 
pet seem lifelike. Sahlin also made famous the "Henson stitch," which al- 
lows two pieces of cloth to be sewn together without a visible seam. Ker- 
mit's nose is made that way, with a seam down the middle. 

Jerry Juhl, another 1961 addition, started out as a puppeteer and 
soon began writing the scripts for the show. In later years, Juhl would be- 
come Henson Associates's chief writer. 

Meanwhile, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. . . . 

Cerf and Frith were busy writing Alligator — a hilarious James Bond 
parody. Having graduated from Harvard with honors in 1964, Frith and 
Cerf joined Beginner Books, the Random House subsidiary responsible 
for publishing Dr. Seuss. 

The winds of destiny blew with force in 1964, bringing to the group 






an inventive, talented seventeen-year-old who would become one of the 
greatest puppeteers of the era. Frank Oz, according to Jim Henson, is the 
main reason that the Muppets are funny. It's Oz's unusual perception of 
life that gives the Muppets their unique flavor. 

The Muppets' first big network appearance, on "The Jack Paar 
Show," also took place in 1964. 

Close Encounters with a Sausage Dog Star. Designed by Don Sah- 
lin for a dogfood commercial, Rowlf the Dog was the first nonabstract 
Muppet. Rowlf emerged as the Muppet's first international star, becoming 
a regular on "The Jimmy Dean Show" in 1965. 

For the first time, people all over the country could enjoy the skill and 
artistry of Jim Henson's style of puppeteering. That same year, Jerry 
Nelson joined the Muppets, and Kermit the Frog guest-starred with host 
Bill Cosby on "The Tonight Show." The following year, the Muppets 
appeared on "The Ed Sullivan Show." 

The stage was set for one of the biggest developments of the century 
in education. "Sesame Street" burst forth on public television in 1969. 
Produced by Children's Television Workshop, it had an immediate, pro- 
found effect on American education. 

The thrust of the new show revolved around the interaction of spe- 
cial talented people and Muppets. Jon Stone, head writer and later di- 
rector of "Sesame Street," helped chart the show through vast unknown 
waters, skillfully avoiding the reefs of preconceived ideas and bias that 
occasionally threatened the smooth progress of the series. Years later,

photo by Nancy de Pra. Gelfling Muppets Jen and Kira set out to save 
the world in Dark Crystal. Frank Oz and fvls. Piggy; Oz is a vp of 
Henson Associates, which signs itself ha! 



Michael Frith observed 

"One of the most astonishing leaps ever made was when Jon Stone, 
who virtually invented 'Sesame Street,' decided to try his old friend and 
sometime collaborator Jim Henson as one of the performing partners on 
the program. 

"At that time, the idea of the Muppets as children's entertainment 
was absolutely outlandish. It was insane. It was really quite a jump for 
Jon to do that, because the Muppets were so bizarre. Jim had strange 
creatures who ate each other when their backs were turned, and things 
that blew up. Who knew where the lightning was going to strike next? 

"So, curiously, the shift of the Muppets from being an underground 
cult group to a mass-cult group was in an arena where the Muppets had 
never originally intended to be, and that was 'Sesame Street,' Children's 
Television Workshop. I still remember the very first 'Sesame Streets,' 
when you turned on the television and this monster came out, went 
'Yagh, yagh, yagh,' and ate a radio! And you sat there and said, 'Good 
lord, did that really happen? Is this show really for kids?" 

The Gang's All Here. Almost all the characters on "Sesame Street" 
were new Muppets, and they became cultural heroes overnight. Mem- 
bers of the gang included a classic "odd couple," Ernie and Bert, the 
Cookie Monster (whose direct ancestor was Yorick), Grover, Guy 
Smiley, and Kermit the Frog. Bantering with them were the Count, 
Sherlock Hemlock, and, in a delightful flight of fantasy, Snuffle-Upagus. 
Joining the Muppets as Caroll Spinney joined Henson w as Big Bird, the

most prominent member of the species Avis gigantus muppetandum, and 
Oscar the Grouch. Then came Sully, Don Music, the Two-Headed Mon- 
ster, Telly Monster, and the perpetual puppy, Barkley. 

Also introduced on "Sesame Street" in various guises were the "Any- 
thing Muppets." Devised by the highly imaginative Caroly Wilcox, these 
were Muppets whose interchangeable features and costumes enabled 
them to be made up quickly to suit any scene or any occasion. 

The interplay between the Muppets and television was also impor- 
tant and is best described in an excellent book from that era, The Art of 
the Muppets (New York: Muppet Press/Bantam Books, 1980). 

According to the book, "Many aspects of the Muppets' growth and cur- 
rent form are directly related to their origins in television." The presence 
of the video monitors enables the puppeteers to observe their own per- 
formances while they're going on. This means, among other things, that 
puppeteers can make adjustments in what they're doing, either in re- 
sponse to seeing themselves live on their monitors or to seeing how a 
certain scene looks on the replay. As the book describes it, "The only real- 
ity exists on the television screen and the response to a situation is con- 
tained not in the twitch of an eyebrow but in the cock of a hand." 

Some things always stay in your blood. In 1970, Chris Cerf and 
Michael Frith helped found The National Lampoon, to which they be- 
came contributing editors. That same year, Cerf left Random House to 
join the Children's Television Workshop, becoming the organization's 
first editor-in-chief of nonbroadcast materials. Developmental child psy- 
chologist Leona Schauble, who would guide the educational thrust of 
"Sesame Street," arrived at CTW two months later. 

The fame of Jim Henson's Muppets on "Sesame Street" reached in- 
ternational proportions, with awards and praise pouring in from around 
the globe. In 1975, Henson was asked to work in England with Lord 
Grade's television company on an entirely different concept. 

A Small Hop for a Frog, a Giant Leap for Muppetkind. Appropri- 
ately titled "The Muppet Show," the project represented a return to 
some of Henson's original perceptions of what Muppet entertainment 
should be. The show, starring Kermit the Frog as host, focused as much 
on adult humor as on ways to make children laugh. Syndicated to regu- 
lar television channels around the world and translated into several lan- 
guages, the show was an instant success, drawing more than two hun- 
dred thirty-five million viewers from more than a hundred countries. 

Many new Muppet characters joined the Henson troupe at this time, 
as did some new creative people. Michael Frith had caught Jim Hen- 
son's eye two years earlier when Frith was doing the artwork for some of 
the Sesame Street books; he became Henson Associates's art director. 
Much of the "Muppet Show" look is credited to him. 

Frith helped to design the Muppet pigs, from which evolved the 
buxom femme fatale. Miss Piggy. Miss Piggy became Kermit's Scarlett 
O'Hara; Kermit became Miss Piggy's "true love." 

"First Mate Piggy, First Mate Piggy! Are you awake?" asks Dr. 
Strangepork. 

"Of course, Tm awake! I just had my eyes closed in concentration," 
Piggy retorts angrily. "I was remembering my arrival at the academy, when 



my heart was pounding as I walked beneath the golden arch. The famous 
Galactic Motto glistened in the early light: 'As You Sow, So Shall You 
Reap.' How inspiring!" 

Captain Link Hogthrob chuckles, "Well, before you start sowing, you'd 
better start reaping. You don't have much time left to study before the ex- 
amination begirds. So you'd better get back to watching that screen." 

" Well, you don't have to be huffy about it," fumes First Mate Piggy. 
She stares into the viewing screen once more and releases the pause button. 

It was the magic combination of Kermit and Miss Piggy that pro- 
pelled "The Muppet Show." Clever new Muppets added depth and di- 
mension to the cast of characters. 

Just as "Sesame Street" had the "Anything Muppets," so "The Mup- 
pet Show" had its "Whatnots." These small Muppets filled out large 
group scenes and chorus lines. There were also the "Strange Things" — 
huge monsters. 

At times, puppeteers and friends began to see themselves directly re- 
flerted in Muppets. It was no idle chance that the Muppet piano player 
in "Sesame Street" bore a strong resemblance to Chris Cerf. Cerf b^an 
singing at Harvard and he regularly provided voice and lyrics for the 
Muppet group. 

Muppet Mecca. "The Muppet Show" ran five years in production. 
Still in syndication, it remains an inspiration to Muppets everywhere, re- 
gardless of fuzz, fur, or fin. 

In the same year that "The Muppet Show" was reaching for the 
stars, "Muppets in the Land of Gorch" wallowed in the mud on "Satur- 
day Night Live." Created primarily by Jim Henson and Michael Frith, 
this show was not for children but for sophisticated young urbanites. 

The Mighty Favog (Frank Oz) resembled an anaent Mayan idol, or 
perhaps an exotic planter, and served as a godlike oracle on the show. 
The inhabitants of Gorch were gruesome, with mossy skin and ghoulish, 
deep-set eyes. The eyes were a significant departure for Henson; they 
were real glass eyes rather than stick-ons, and they contributed greatly to 
the ferocious look of these Muppets. Henson set a new trend with exten- 
sive use of body jewelry and barbaric costumes; King Ploobis really did 
have scrimshaw on his trunks. 

In 1976, Chris Cerf became special consultant to Joan Ganz Coo- 
ney, president of Children's Television Workshop, and began the crea- 
tive design of Sesame Place. Originally built in Philadelphia, this educa- 
tional playpark was duplicated in Dallas, Texas. 

The next phase of the Henson conquest of the world's heart began in 
1977 with "Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas" television special. Now 
the creative energies of Henson Associates were directed toward design- 
ing more realistic characters. Otters, possums, beavers, and woodchucks 
were created and costumed in intricate detail. Every effort was made to 
bring Emmet Otter's natural surroundings to life. The master touch of 
Franz "Faz" Fazakas made possible effects such as Emmet rowing a 
boat down a stream. 

In 1978, the winds of destiny blew darkly. Don Sahlin's untimely 
death deprived Henson Associates not only of a good friend but of its 
finest Muppet designer, and just when Henson was about to embark on

his most challenging project to date, The Muppet Movie. 

"Animal Want Popcorn!" The Muppet Movie brought to the screen 
all the characters the television show had made famous. In the grand fi- 
nale, one hundred sixty puppeteers brought together almost every 
Muppet that had ever been created. Art director Michael Frith and the 
Henson puppet makers carried on the work of Don Sahlin. 

In 1978, one significant event to occur was, in a sense, a small one, 
even microscopic. Chris Cerf discovered the Apple II. 

The blossoming Henson empire would never be the same. 

Computers were already a familiar part of Chris Cerfs life. His wife 
Genevieve is an electrical engineer and computer scientist. Once Cerf dis- 
covered the microcomputer, it wasn't long before their mid-Manhattan 
townhouse was replete with computers and peripherals, including an 
alphaSyntauri music synthesizer and an Apple Graphics Tablet. These 
blended in nicely with his large toy robot collection. 

The Seeds of Educational Technology. It was at this time that Cerf 
conceived of a computer center for the embryonic Sesame Place play- 
park — using, naturally. Apples. He did the original programming for the 
first educational games, which were based on the Muppet characters, but 
it was Joyce Hakansson who was responsible for the construction of the 
Sesame Place computer center and for the compiling of the sixty some 
programs that eventually were used. 

Chris Cerf became a present-day Johnny Appleseed, planting his 
enthusiastic feeling about Apple computers throughout the Henson 
empire. The first harvest yielded Jon Stone and Jerry Juhl, both of whom 
immediately appreciated the power of word processing on the Apple for 
script writing. From 1979 on. Stone wrote all his "Sesame Street" scripts 
on his Apple. It became a familiar sight to see Jon Stone on the set di- 
recting a "Sesame Street" episode with a rolled up copy of the latest 
script, hot off his Epson printer, in his back pocket. Juhl, meanwhile, 
handled the evolutionary development of the Muppets on his Apple. 

Also in 1979, Frank Oz performed what began as a minor spot of 
non-Muppet puppeteering in a movie. His dynamic, mystical portrayal 
of Yoda, the ancient Jedi Master in The Empire Strikes Back, captured 
the imagination of the audience. Yoda was the surprise hit of the movie, 
a superstar overnight. 

Nineteen seventy-nine was a year of progressive changes for the 
Muppets' human friends. 

Jim Henson found a way to personalize the Muppet experience for 
children everywhere. A special exhibit. The Art of the Muppets, began 
touring the nation's museums. When it appeared at the Children's Mu- 
seum in Boston, crowds were willing to wait hours to see the exhibit. 

Through his own company, Christopher Cerf Associates, Cerf be- 
came creative consultant to Henson Associates, Children's Television 
Workshop, and Fischer-Price. His function? To help guide these compa- 
nies into the microcomputer age. 

"Ha, ha, ha. Apples? He, he, he." At Henson Associates, Apples 
play key roles in everyday business affairs. Early this year. Bill Effros in- 
troduced Apple word processing to several of the Henson groups. In pro- 



duction, accountant Nellie Evans and her assistant Tania David use the 
Apple to keep track of show residuals and departmental budgets. Mar- 
keting vice president Jerome L. Houle III considers the Apple invalu- 
able for forecasting and trend analysis. 

Another Apple became a librarian for a group of short, business-ori- 
ented Muppet films that corporations can use to liven up lunch breaks at 
long, serious company meetings. Produced with Henson's customary 
flair, the Muppet Meeting Film series has been a huge success; the fifteen 
films featuring Grump and Leo are in constant demand. 

At Sesame Place playparks, Apples produce sound effects and main- 
tain databases of park activities. 

Two strong advocates of Apples at Henson are Harriet Yassky and 
Jane Leventhol. Yassky and Leventhol have in common small size and 
giant expertise, Leventhol in publishing and Yassky in business affairs 
and electronic products. 

"We are very interested as a company in creating software and prod- 
ucts for microcomputers, especially the Apple, featuring the Muppet 
characters," Yassky states. Her current project is the computer adap- 
tion of a precedent-shattering Henson film. Dark Crystal. 

The alternative thrust that Jim Henson began with the Land of 
Gorch characters on "Saturday Night Live" reaches its majority in Dark 
Crystal, a nonanimated movie done with puppets. Dark Crystal is not, 
Henson stresses, a Muppet movie, at least not in the traditional sense of 
the fun-loving Henson movies. The difference is in the mood of the Dark 
Crystal world. As J. R. R. Tolkien portrayed the bittersweetness of Mid- 
dle Earth in Lord of the Rings, so has Jim Henson captured the feeling of 
Lower Earth, a land ruled for ages by chaos. 

DC Scrolls. The story purports to be based on a translation of the 
arcane Book of Aughra, written by Aughra, the immortal Keeper of Se- 
crets. The book opens with Aughra recounting the story of her birthing 

Of the race of Aughra, I, Aughra, am alone, the first and the last. Born 
from the need for rocks and trees for an eye to see the world. The wind 
blew and the blind trees sang and roots twisted in the dark rocks and the 
roots sang and the rocks cracked and I was Aughra. This is my song. 

Aughra lives in a mountain observatory, replete with a gigantic me- 
chanical model of the heavens. From here, she chronicles the evil reign of 
the reptilian Skeksis, an intelligent species that had gained power by cast- 
ing the world into darkness. They had broken a fragment off the Great 
Crystal that was the focus of the three suns' light. Only the return of the 
missing shard to the darkened crystal can complete the crystal's matrix 
and end the tyranny of the Skeksis. 

As the plot unfolds, Jen and Kira, the only surviving members of the 
Gelfling, an ancient elfin people, set out to restore the crystal's bril- 
liance. Guided by the urRu, a mystical race, and riding their Landstriders, 
Jen and Kira overcome dangerous obstacles to heal the crystal. Even 
Aughra helps. The gentle Pod People watch over Jen and Kira while the 
Garthim, hitmen for the Skeksis, track them mercilessly.

Saga of a Skeksis: Leigh Donaldson's human hands practice with a waldo of a Skeksis hand, then the Skeksis is whole and chooses to boot the Dark 
Crystal adventure to see himself. Left photo by Jonathan Becker; center right and right photos by Marianne Bernstein, 



"Get Them Muppets Out of Here! This Is Faery Country!" The 

world of Dark Crystal is brought to life in lavish and intricate sets by 
Brian Froud, illustrator of the bestseller Faeries. Froud based his visual- 
ization on Jim Henson's rich, suspenseful story. 

The people at Henson Associates enjoy their work and take great 
pride in Muppet accomplishments; it's not surprising that cooperation 
was a keynote in the production of Dark Crystal. Gary Kurtz, producer 
of the first two Star Wars movies, joined with Jim Henson in producing 
the movie; Henson and Frank Oz were codirectors. 

Dark Crystal is a milestone for the art of puppetry, too. The puppets 
are so smooth and fluid in motion and so lifehke that they can easily be 
mistaken for carefully animated characters. The creative technical genius 
of Faz Fazakas is credited with this accomplishment. Its generation 
can be attributed to Jim Henson's longtime delving into the realm of 
computer assisted robotics with his puppets' movements in mind. 

Years ago, when Big Bird first joined the Muppets, Fazakas de- 
signed the remote control system to move Big Bird's eyes. In the process, 
he brought the worlds of waldos and computer enhancements to puppet- 
eering. Waldo is a term coined by science fiction writer Robert A. Hein- 
lein to describe mechanical extensions that allow operators working with 
special materials to perform delicate operations by remote control. 

Around that time, Chris Cerf had produced, directed, and scored a

robot Muppet show at Sesame Place. The robot Muppets' hand move- 
ments were made on waldos and recorded in digitized form. Later, the 
movements were played back to computer controlled Muppet robotic 
hands. Fazakas developed the waldos into very sophisticated tools to 
of)erate whole motor-driven characters. 

"The early Disney automated figures moved at a very slow twenty- 
four time frames per second," Fazakas relates. "Of course, in terms of 
control, that is a very crude increment. You can actually see the slight 
jerkiness in the figures. That was state of the art twenty years ago. With 
the new techniques we have developed, we achieve many thousand time 
frames per second. The characters become very lifelike." 

Wooden Acting. The Skeksis' lifelike appearance is credited to the use 
of special latex stretched over complex wooden frames. These frames 
with their multitude of wires and controls allow the puppeteer unparal- 
leled range of expression. The hands are the work of Leigh Donaldson, 
under whose control the Skeksis' hands became capable of very subtle 
nuances of movement and were able to perform delicate intricate tasks. 

Encouraged by Chris Cerf, Henson Associates undertook a bold 
move: to expand into the microcomputer games market. The company 
decided to adapt Dark Crystal to the Apple computer. At that time, 
Sierra On-Line was the chief publisher of hi-res graphics adventures. So 
Chris Cerf and Mary Ann Horstmeyer flew to California to discuss the 
venture with Roberta Williams, author of the epic microadventure Time 
Zone. A deal was struck. 

Says Williams, "This adventure isn't like any we've done before. Jim 
Mahon, the art director at Henson Associates, sketches each page of the 
action and sends it to me. My people translate the sketches onto the Ap- 
ple with graphics tablets. 

"Then the hi-res pages are sent to Jim Mahon for his approval and 
suggestions. Actually, everyone in New York helps out. Harriet, Mary 
Ann, and Chris all review each screen and make suggestions. 

"We plan on having the game finished and available to coincide with 
the release of the movie at Christmastime." 

Meanwhile, back at home. . . 

One project at a time no longer seems enough for the people at Hen- 
son Associates, not even when that project has several heads. 

"After five years of doing 'The Muppet Show,' " explains Michael 
Frith, "we did a fork: going in two very different directions at the same 
time. In one direction was Dark Crystal, which called on all our disci- 
plines to reinvent the whole idea of puppetry. In effect, we had to rede- 
fine what we were already involved with: not so much puppetry as the 
creation of the illusion of life. Dark Crystal is a completely different, very 
sophisticated world." 

Rock of the Ages. The other branch of the fork took Henson to 
"Fraggle Rock," another world altogether. 

"Never before had we decided to do a television show purely for chil- 
dren. In thinking through the idea, we saw that we really could do a 
show solely for children, and for children around the world. Such a show 
would deal with universal questions, problems, needs, misunderstand- 
ings, and understandings — things that affect kids all over the world and 
aren't particular to our cuhure. 

" 'Fraggle Rock' is geared to the 'Mid-Kid,' kids seven to ten years 
old who're left out of virtually all other programming. The show ad- 
dresses questions of self, growth, change, and, in particular, relation- 
ships with people outside the child's family." 

Frith is creative director of "Fraggle Rock"; he developed the main

concepts in the show. Once again, every Muppet is original. 

Fraggle Rock is a multilayered world that's a self-contained 
ecosystem. Every species within this world has a symbiotic relationship 
with every other species. While Fraggle Rock doesn't actually exist in the 
human's world, there's a gateway between the two worlds through a hole 
in the wall of Doc's workshop. The only human to appear in the show, 
and bearing a close resemblance to Franz Fazakas, Doc is a puttering 
inventor. His workshop is cluttered with all kinds of odds and ends. 

Through the portal in the baseboard, adventurous Fraggles occa- 
sionally sneak past Doc's dog. Sprocket, for prized bits of junk. Doc 
never sees a Fraggle. 

The Fraggles share Fraggle Rock with a unique assortment of crea- 
tures, most of whom try to avoid having anything to do with the others. 
A constant irritation to the Fraggles are the "terminally cute" Doozers. 

Doozers are only six inches high. Resembling a happy platoon of 
army engineers, with hard hats pulled down over their antennae, the 
Doozers work methodically, building intricate but often incomprehensi- 
ble structures. They build over, through, or under anything. If a Fraggle 
takes a nap, he's likely to wake to find that Doozers have built a clover- 
leaf over him. 

The other regular inhabitants of Fraggle Rock are the gigantic

Gorgs, fifteen times the size of a Fraggle, who live in the Kingdom of 
Gorg. There are only three of them left, the Gorg royal family. Ma, Pa, 
and Junior. They live in a crumbling old castle and tend to their large 
garden. 

It's this garden that's the source of conflict between the Gorgs and 
the Fraggles. The Fraggles love to raid the garden; one of the huge vege- 
tables is enough to feed a dozen Fraggles. Consequently, the Gorgs are 
always trying to stomp on the Fraggles. 

There's one other reason Fraggles dare risk the perilous foray into 
the Gorg gardoi: the Trash Heap. Reminiscent of the Mighty Favog, the 
Trash He^ is a living compost heap. The Fraggles think she's an oracle 
and brave the wrath of the Gorgs to seek her advice in times of trouble. 

Gunsmoking Postcards. One of the Fraggles does venture out into 
the human world. Traveling Mat sets out to explore the World Beyond 
Doc's Room and doesn't return. Periodically, he sends postcards to his 
nephew, Gobo, describing his adventures in the outer world. 

"Fraggle Rock" was produced in Toronto, Canada, and is sched- 
uled to begin broadcasting in January 1983, following close on the heels 
of Dark Crystal. The show is to appear solely on Home Box Office, mak- 
ing it the first weekly series ever on a cable network. 

With "Fraggle Rock," Henson Associates is breaking new ground in- 
ternationally. As Michael Frith explains, "When we were doing 'The 
Muppet Show' in England, the cultural difficulty of taking a show from 
one country and putting it into another became obvious. We wanted 
people to accept the show both as entertainment and as something they 
felt strongly about personally — and that's a problem. 

"We've solved this dilemma by personalizing the show for each host 
country. Doc is our lead-in to 'Fraggle Rock.' In each country, we'll 
shoot separate opening scenes using local performers in local settings. 
This will give a good international flavor, bringing each host country in- 
to the show. We'll also shoot the Traveling Mat sequences locally, mak- 
ing the viewers feel right at home." 

Making that international flavor taste natural led to more innova- 
tion. The problem was to facilitate a script collaboration between Jerry 
Juhl in Los Gatos, California, and Jocelyn Gunnar Stevenson in Wales. 
Both writers use Apple word processing to do their work. With Chris 
Cerfs help, they b^an sending their scripts back and forth via modem. 
Then a communication triangle was set up between Juhl, Stevenson, and 
the studio in Toronto. The resulting episodes were developed in an en- 
vironment totally independent of physical location. 

The rest of the Muppets haven't been idle just because their friends 
were involved in new movies and television shows. Some of the Mup- 
pets have been in China shooting a "Big Bird in China" Sesame Street 
Special. Kermit the Frog took another Muppet group to Colorado to 
film a John Denver Special. 

One Muppet friend, Leona Schauble, is now research director of the 
newly formed Children's Computer Workshop, a division of Children's 
Television Workshop. Schauble's group is responsible for creating Ses- 
ame Street based educational and entertainment games for the Apple 
and a host of personal computers. 

Dial C for Computer Hero. Christopher Cerf Associates is deeply in- 
volved in a new concept in computer storytelling. Cerfs programs allow 
children to become their own heroes. He continues his "self-imposed 
mission of guiding creativity through the new-world thicket of computer 
technology." 

"First Mate Piggy! Time is up!" says Captain Link Hogthrob in his 
most commanding voice. "Now, if you're still willing, you must take the 
comprehensive, profound examination that probes the very foundation of the 
universe. " 

First Mate Piggy exclaims, "Where have I heard all that before? Of 
course, I'm ready! I'm always ready!" 

Replies the captain, " Well, I certainly wish you luck. If you make it, I'll 
take all of us to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe for a snack." 

"Brace yourself. Piggy, " warns Dr. Strangepork. ' ' You have only three 
hours to answer this one question, which will test your fitness to earn your 
Ph.D. Ready?" 

"Ready, willing, and able," replies First Mate Piggy. 

Dr. Strangepork lowers his voice dramatically and asks, ' ' What color is 
the Frog?"

Mind Your 




BY PETER OLIVIERI 




Here we are in the last month of 1982. Who can imagine what new 
advances are on the horizon in the world of microcomputing? What will 
1983 bring? 

Say, there's a good idea. Some evening while you're relaxing, curled 
up in front of a warm fire or just enjoying the warm evening breeze, jot 
down a list of the new products you think we'll see within the next five 
years. We can share our speculations in a future column. 

As a reader of this column you get asked to do a lot of writing, but 
judging by your response, it seems that you must like having the oppor- 
tunity to let your feelings be known. Send along your ideas to Softalk 
Crystal Ball, Box 60, North Hollywood, CA 91603. Who knows— shar- 
ing your thoughts may prompt someone to create just what you have 
in mind. 

BUG on Printers. This month we'll spend some time discussing 
printers and word processors with Business User Group members. This 
can be an excellent vehicle for sharing your joys and frustrations. The as- 
sumption here is that what readers experience is well worth sharing. 

It's a good idea to look at all the comments, since there may be more 
than one that's useful to you. In the interest of space, some comments 
will be faithfully summarized rather than shared in their entirety. Also, 
keep in mind that one person may like certain features of a product while 
another may think them worthless. In other words, take all of these 
comments with a grain of salt. And do your homework — you are the ul- 
timate decision maker. 



allow me to swap my printer for a new model. The documentation stinks. 
It was originally written for a TRS-80. [There is now an excellent book on 
the Epson for the Apple.] As an example of some of the problems that I 
have had, consider that the dip switch settings shown in the appendices 
conflict with the settings in the Graftrax 80 documentation, which con- 
flict with the settings in the Grappler documentation. Ouch. 
Paul Metzker, Jonesboro, GA 

The printer I have is an MX-80 F /T with Graftrax Plus. It is interfaced 
to my Apple III with an Apple III Universal Parallel Interface card. It is 
an excellent printer. I make frequent use of the capability to change the 
type of print in the middle of a document and it works quite well. In 
some applications, I like it better than a daisy wheel printer attached to a 
large mainframe we have. One weakness is in switching back and forth 
between tractor-feed and friction-feed. 
J. Kustura, Kokomo, IN 

I have an MX-lOO printer with full graphics capability. It has full graph- 
ics capability, but / don't. There must be ways to do such things as to 
make a graph using VisiPlot and place it into a report typed with Ap- 
ple Writer. I'm hoping to get a daisy wheel printer someday, and as a 
novice, I'm not sure what to look for. Any help in this regard will be 
greatly appreciated. 
Linda Knoll, Swarthmore, PA 



Epson Printers 

I own an MX-80 F/T and use the Grappler interface card. I'm not sure of 
the strengths of the machine since I have nothing to compare it to. Its 
major weakness is the instruction book. It's not very well written. In- 
structions on using the printer for word processing are nonexistent. 
Robert Bloomer, Santa Ana, CA 

My printer is an MX-80 F/T and I use the Grappler Plus interface. It's 
an extremely versatile printer and I have no complaints about it. The 
paper sometimes needs adjustment, however. 

Prior to this, I had a Silentype. While it was useful, it was not nearly 
as versatile as the Epson. I was also swayed by the fact that there are Ep- 
son user groups throughout the country, lots of articles about the Ep- 
son, and useful utility programs. 
J. Waterfield, M.D., Springfield, NJ 

I have an MX-80 F/T with Graftrax 80, interfaced with the Apple via an 
Orange Micro Grappler card. Some of the printer's strengths are its com- 
pact size, true descenders, a nine-by-nine matrix, reasonable price, and 
ease of changing ribbon and print heads. I have much more to say about 
its weaknesses. I have owned the printer since March 1982 and have not 
yet been able to use a complete, unbroken printer. My tractor-feed mech- 
anism jams paper at the pin-feed area. This F /T mechanism has been un- 
der constant repair, and this has had serious consequences for my word 
processing applications. By the time I reach the sixth page of a docu- 
ment, top and bottom margins are uneven and left and right margins 
shift size. 

There have been other problems. Two days after I bought the print- 
er, new models were released (with Graftrax Plus and underlining). None 
of the dealers knew about this, even after ads had appeared. Even though 
my printer had not yet been shipped, neither the dealer nor Epson would 



We have twelve MX-80s — three with Graftrax and six with Graftrax 
Plus, two MX-80 F/Ts, one MX-lOO and one Diablo. [This is from a 
school system. Whew!] We looked at Okidata, Epson, Centronics, NEC, 
Texas Instruments and ProWriter. The Epson won easily. The Pro- 
Writer is probably a better printer, but it is new and has little software 
support. NEC is in the same category. TI is fast, but big and expensive. 
Okidata and Centronics are widely supported but local dealers reported 
some service problems with both brands. 

It came down to the Epson versus the Okidata. A local dealer put a 
box of paper beneath each of these machines and began printing copies 
of a catalog. This ran for eight hours. The Epson printed 108 copies, the 
Okidata 82. This was mainly due to the Okidata's stopping every few 
pages to cool the print head. The Epson seemed never to overheat. Both 
printers required one ribbon change (late in the day). The Okidata had 
some problems a few months later. The Epson is still being used (and 
with the same print head). 

We thus use MX-80s everywhere we need a printer, MX-80 F/Ts if 
we have to feed letterhead, and the MX-lOO for large Fw/Ca/c tables and 
for big graphs for display purposes. For 90 percent of our needs, the Ep- 
son gives good enough letter quality when used in enhanced mode. Our 
only complaint is speed. A long listing or rough draft of a book seems to 
take forever. We'd gladly pay twice the price for the speed. 

For those cases where almost letter quality was not good enough, we 
looked at C. Itoh, NEC Spinwriter, Qume, and Diablo. The price was 
right on C. Itoh but we needed more speed. The Qume suffered from a 
bad local reputation for service. The NEC and the Diablo seemed about 
equal — both were excellent. Since the Diablo was available locally for 
less, it was our choice. As with the Epsons, we have never had to have the 
Diablo serviced. It chewed up a ribbon once in a while, but that seems to 
have corrected itself. 
Bill Michael, Bedford, TX 



NEC Spinwriter 

I bought a Model 5510 in May of 1980. It uses an Apple high-speed Se- 
rial Card. The strengths of this machine include sturdy and attractive 
design and construction, mechanical reliability, excellent print quality 
(but use only NEC ribbons), simplicity of operation, and flexibility (dif- 
ferent paper widths, types, and so on). It has some weaknesses. The 
printing speed is relatively slow. Bidirectional printing is allowed only if 
your software can control it. It is rather noisy. Finally, software areas can 
result in mechanical binding of the print thimble. 

I wanted the best printer, and I think I got it. I feel that it is unlikely 
to become obsolete (except in terms of printing speed). Every print thim- 
ble available has at least one undesirable feature. On one, the zero looks 
like an "O." I wish there were a thimble with the same character set as 
the IBM Letter Gothic typing ball! 
James Pittman, Jr., Albuquerque, NM 

Centronics 

I have a Centronics 779 with tractor feed. It is reliable, with low mainte- 
nance, variable print size and column width, and variable paper width up 
to twelve inches. Its weaknesses include upper case only, no graphics, too 
noisy, and too slow (60 to 100 cps). This was the best machine I could 
buy at the time. 
R. Keelin, Lenexa, KS 

Okidata 

The printer model I have is the Miaoline 82A. The interface (OK 12) was 
purchased from Interactive Structures in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. 
This machine has good quality print and prints about 120 cps. Alterna- 
tive character sizes are available, as well as boldface print. Tractor-feed is 
an option. Ribbons are inexpensive. You can upgrade for hi-res graph- 
ics if you want to. Two weaknesses are the inability to underline and the 
fact that it can't do proportional spacing. 
N. Wood, Saratoga, CA 

Apple III Printers 

For software development and generation of hard-copy graphics, we are 
using an Integral Data Systems model 460G dot-matrix printer. For cor- 
respondence and documentation, we are using a Brother model HR-1 
daisy wheel printer. Both of these printers are interfaced to the Apple III 
with Apple's Universal Parallel Interface Card. 

The IDS has been a very rehable printer. Since the Brother was a very 
recent purchase, it is too early to judge it in this regard, but it looks great. 
We really like the flexibility of the IDS printer. Its principal weakness is 
that the dealer has been trying to get accessories for it for more than 
three months with no success. As for the Brother, its principal strength is 
the high-quality text it produces and the fart that it will print ten, twelve, 
and fifteen characters per inch at the flip of a switch. 
M. Williams, Sunflower Micro Systems, Kansas City, KS 

Another Brother 

We have a Brother HR-1. It is a daisy wheel printer and gives beautiful 
copy with an IBM ribbon. The manual is not as complete as it should be. 
So far its only weakness seems to be an inability to do superscripts and 
subscripts. 

H. Podell, New Rochelle, NY 

BUG Spray. Before we move on to user group members' requests for 
assistance, it's important to remember a couple of things when it comes to 
purchasing products. The first is that after you've bought a product, it 
tends to look good to you. Secondly, one good experience or one bad 
one gives little evidence as to the quality of a particular produrt. Look 
instead for consistent patterns, responses, and reactions. 

A fairly reasonable summary of the printer information just present- 
ed would include the following observations. Epsons are inexpensive and 
popular; the manual that comes with the Epson is terrible; many pro- 
grams don't allow you to use all of the printer's features; and a "rising 
star" might be the letter-quality Brother HR-1. 

Ask the BUG. Many BUG members have questions that they hope 
can be answered by some of their colleagues. If you can provide some 



help with any of the following questions, please be in touch and your re- 
sponse will appear in this sertion of the column. 

How well do daisy wheel printers print graphics? 

How do you get an Epson MX-80 F/T printer with Graftrax 80 (in- 
terfacing with a Grappler card) to perform with Apple Writer IP. For ex- 
ample, how do you italicize a book title in text? How do you underline 
text? How can superscripts or subscripts be done? 

When using an Epson MX-80 F/T, how can you get the print com- 
mands that require an escape-code entry into an Apple Writer program? 

How do you program WordStar (using a Microsoft CP/M installa- 
tion) to control all the printer features? 

With a Centronics 779, how do you turn the printer on and off from 
within a CP/M program (Microsoft)? 

Is the PrintaColor PG-1000 worth the extra money over the IDS 
Prism for a color printer? 

Would a four pen color plotter be better than a color printer? If you 
dump a hi-res screen to a plotter, does it do all of one color first or does it 
change pens fifty times trying to act like a printer^ 

Word Processors Processed. In an earlier Mind Your Business in- 
stallment, you were asked for feedback on your experiences using differ- 
ent word processing programs. Since one of the purposes of this column 
is to provide a forum for sharing experiences, some of the comments re- 
ceived appear here. For more specific coverage of word processors, you 
may wish to refer to Softalk's continuing series on word processors. 

Apple Writer 

"Apple Writer II is easy to use. The program commands are logical, 
and the manual is well organized. It produces standard Apple text files. It 
is powerful, with very flexible print formatting capability, and can print 
every ASCII character except for the back slash. The program has a buff- 
er for deleted chararters; you can make use of this if you wish to recover 
from a mistaken deletion. It will adapt for eighty-column use with the ap- 
propriate card. You can select for the word-wrap feature to be on or off. 
Commands can be upper or lower case. 

"Weaknesses include copy-protected disks (you cannot make badk-ups) 
and the inability to find or replace the «th occurrence of the string. In ad- 
dition, the block move feature is awkward and of limited use, there is no 
preview mode that lets you see what the printed copy will look like, near- 
ly anything you do ultimately leaves you in insert mode (which is irritat- 
ing), and finally, it will not support proportional spacing or bidirection- 
al printing. 

"We use a lower-case adapter as well as a $20 disk from Videx that 
lets you operate in eighty-column mode on the Videx card. This is an ex- 
cellent word processor." 

"We have Apple Writer II. The program is easy to use, comes with 
very thorough documentation, and is well worth the price. Support is 
widely available. Among the program's weaknesses: unless you are using 
a Silentype or a Qume printer, some of the printing options won't be 
available to you (at least they won't be documented). According to my 
dealer, there seems to be no way that a user can italicize or use empha- 
sized print (for example, with an Epson). 

"We tried several packages before settling on Apple Writer. Our em- 
ployer was using Executive Secretary but has now switched to Apple 
Writer. By the way, if you haven't moved up from the original version to 
version II, do so ... it makes a big difference." 

"We currently have Apple Writer II. It came with our Apple Family' 
System. We like it a lot. However, we think we'll soon be moving up to 
an eighty-column card and will probably acquire Word Handler. We like 
the idea of being able to see on the screen exactly what will appear on the 
printed page. We looked at the Word Handler documentation and found 
it to be very simple. Page endings will be shown. We can print one page 
from the middle of a document if we wish. 

"Our biggest complaint is the inability of most word processors to 
utilize fully the features of our Epson MX- 100. In fact, after spending so 
much time learning how to do some things mih Apple Writer, it may not 
be worth the extra investment of time to learn to do it all over again with 
a new word processing package."

Super-Text 

"We have Super-Text II. It is easy to use and the manual is well or- 
ganized. The package is very powerful. It has a built-in "math mode," an 
autoiink feature that allows for linking several disk files, the ability to 
copy, save, or delete blocks of text, and the capability of printing every 
ASCII character. You can set the colon (:) key to type the if you wish (in- 
teresting). A preview mode lets you see how the finished document will 
look. It is not limited to eighty columns of printed output and the print- 
formatting commands are extremely powerful. We got fairly good sup- 
port from the vendor (Muse). 

"Among the weaknesses we found: the files that are created cannot be 
accessed from Apple DOS or Pascal, disks are copy-protected, headers 
and footers cannot be printed automatically, there's no buffer when de- 
leting text (once gone, it's gone) and no provision for eighty-column op- 
eration, there's a relatively small workspace (about twenty thousand 
characters), it does not take advantage of an additional 16K card if pres- 
ent, and it does not support proportional spacing or bidirectional print- 
ing. While we found this program difficult to learn, we are now used to it 
and think it is great. This may be a common feeling once a person has in- 
vested the time in learning a particular package. 

"Recently, we also obtained Super-Text 40/80. It has all of the fea- 
tures just described and more. In addition, the colon key can now be 
used to enter any string of characters you wish. This can be extremely 
helpful in many applications. There are many improvements to the find 
and replace option. For example, you have single key control, multiple 
find and replace, and wild card options. Obviously, the package will 
work in either forty or eighty column mode. We found the on-screen 
messages to be better, and got good support from Muse. Headers and 
footers can now be printed. The package also loads, saves, and prints 
files created with a Super-Text II package. 

"Some of the weaknesses cited earlier still exist. The two new ones are 
a smaller workspace (fifteen thousand characters) and the fact that the 



eighty-column mode is a bit awkward to work with (and makes for a 
considerable loss in speed). Since our copy did not interface with our 
Spinwriter, we had to print using our Super-Text II. The vendor says that 
a change is forthcoming. It has not forthcome yet. 

"A final suggestion for word processing users. Get something to give 
you upper and lower case. The Videx eighty-column board is excellent 
and offers good support and a lot of extra features." 

"We are currently using three word processing packages: Super-Text 
II, Super-Text 40/56/70, and Screen Writer II. Super-Text 1 1 was the one 
we standardized with. It was the easiest to learn to use. Although it al- 
lowed you only forty columns, many of our users began to prefer it be- 
cause of the larger size of the characters. Columns of numbers were the 
only problem (they often looked strange on the screen). The inability to 
print headers and footers or an index bothered some people. Finally, it 
was difficult to interface the package with our Diablo and Epson (if we 
wanted to use all of the printer's features). 

"Screen Writer II would have solved most of these shortcomings. 
However, it was quite difficult to learn to use, necessitating much flip- 
ping back and forth to the manual. 

"Super-Text 40/56/70 helped a lot, particularly with respect to using 
the printer. A lower-case adapter was no longer needed, and the seventy- 
column mode was quite useful for viewing what text would ultimately 
look like. However, some things changed. Math mode and split-screen 
use vanished. The speed seemed to slow considerably." 

Happy Holidays. Well, we've rambled a bit longer than usual. But 
taking time to share reader feedback is worthwhile. In fact, a special sec- 
tion of the column will be dedicated to this purpose in the future. Next 
month, we'll get back to the regular format. Among other things, we'll 
discuss Apple III software and documentation and review some new 
products. 

See you soon. Have a great holiday and a happy new year.

In any type of computerized 3-D graphics system, you start by creat- 
ing a set of points, lines, and shapes in 3-D. Every point has a relation- 
ship to every other point it can be higher or lower, closer or farther 
away, and more to the left or right. And, of course, this relationship de- 
pends on your point of view. The three different direction aspects of a 
point are represented using three numbers, or coordinates, labeled X, Y, 
and Z. It's the computer's job to convert your set of points according to 
some formula into points on a two-dimensional screen, using only X and 
Y coordinates. Then the points are connected with the appropriate lines, 
just as the 3-D points were connected with lines. 

There are two different philosophies used in creating 3-D graphics. 
For the first, imagine a universe in which all of the 3-D objects exist. You 
describe the objects and tell the computer where they are in the universe. 
You then decide where your eye is, and which direction you're looking. 
The computer figures out which objects lie in that direction, converts 
them into a single two-dimensional image, and draws that image on the 
screen. This concept makes it fairly easy to represent complex scenes, but 
manipulating individual objects within that scene can be more time-con- 
suming. 

Another philosophy is to treat each 3-D object separately on the 
screen. You describe each 3-D object, then tell the computer where the 
objects should appear on the two-dimensional screen (or if they should 
appear at all), what size to draw them, and how they should be oriented. 
Each object is converted from three dimensions to two, independent of 
every other object. This means complex scenes can require more pro- 
gramming to produce, but manipulating each individual object is faster 
and easier. This is the technique used by GraForth. 

GraForth allows you to manipulate 3-D objects through direct high- 
level commands. For example, the GraForth word scale sets the dis- 
played size of a 3-D object, xrot rotates the object about the X axis, and 
ypos sets the vertical position of the object on the screen. These straight- 
forward commands provide an easy-to-follow method of generating 3-D 
graphics. 

The 3-D process can be divided into two parts: first, the image is 
created using the Image Editor supplied on the GraForth system disk. 
Then, the GraForth commands are used to read the image and draw the 
object on the screen with the appropriate rotation and scale. The image 
may reside in any free area of memory and is not changed by the draw- 
ing commands. 

Let's define a couple of words for this discussion. An "image" is a set 
of 3-D points and lines as stored in memory. An "object" is a picture of 
the 3-D image as it is manipulated and actually displayed on the screen. 
Images can reside in memory without being assigned as objects and 
drawn; and two objects, though positioned and oriented differently on 
the screen, can both use the same 3-D image in memory. (For example. 



two rotating cubes on the screen can use the same set of 3-D lines.) 

For each image, the X, Y, andZ coordinates can range from — 128 to 
127, giving a possible 256 positions along each of the three axes, which is 
plenty for most applications. The actual number of lines in an image is 
limited only by the amount of available memory. (Each end point of line 
entry in the image uses four bytes of memory.) 

Up to sixteen different objects can be manipulated at one time in 
GraForth. They are numberd 0 through 15, and referenced with the Gra- 
Forth word object. After giving an object command, the 3-D commands 
will manipulate that object until another object command is given. For 
example, if you type: 

3 OBJECT 
30 XROT 
10 SCALE 

then object 3 wall be rotated 30 units around the X axis and scaled to a 
size of 10. To manipulate a number of objects, you select each object in 
turn with object, then give the appropriate commands for that object. 

Here is a quick summary of the individual 3-D commands, their ef- 
fects, and the appropriate ranges of numbers to use: 

Xpos, ypos. These set the X and Y position on the screen of the 3-D 
point (0,0,0) for the object and are used for positioning the object in the 
appropriate place on the screen. Xpos can range from 0 to 255 and ypos 
can range from 0 to 191. At the extremes, however, the object may over- 
lap the edge of the screen, causing wraparound. 

Scalx, scaly, scale. These commands determine the size of the ob- 
ject on the screen. Scabc sets the width and scaly sets the height. The word 
scale simply sets both width and height to the same number simultane- 
ously. The range is from -3 1 to 3 1 . A scale of 0 produces a displayed ob- 
ject with no thickness, and negative numbers create a mirror-image ef- 
fect. Since two objects can use the same image in memory, symmetrical 
objects, such as bird wings, can be created using two objects side by side, 
with positive and negative scale numbers. This is the technique used for 
the two wings of the flying bat in the Die Fledermaus portion of the dem- 
onstration program. 

Scalz. This determines the amount of perspective used. Perspective is 
what causes the front of an object to appear larger than the back. A large 
perspective number makes the front a good deal larger, and negative 
numbers provide "reverse perspiective," with the back of the object larger 
than the front. Zero perspective means the front and the back will be the 
same size. The range, as above, is —31 to 31. 

Xrot, yrot, zrot. These commands rotate the current object around 
each of the three 3-D axes. A complete rotation is divided up into units 
from 0 to 256. Zero is no rotation, 64 is a right angle, 128 is the same as 
180 degrees, and 192 is three-quarters around the circle. Values greater 
than 256 or less than 0 can also be used for rotating more than once 
around. For example, a rotation to 258 units is the same as to 2 units. 



124 



^ O [ T A I 1/ 



DECEMBER 1982 



Note: The actual rotation of the object changes for every other rotation 
value. This means that if you rotate an object in steps of 1 unit per draw, 
the view of the object will change every other draw, making the anima- 
tion appear slower. It's best to increment rotation values in steps of 2. 

Xtran, ytran, ztran. These commands translate, or "slide," the ob- 
ject in each of the three directions in space. The object can be shifted as 
long as none of its points falls out of the -128 to 127 position range. If 
this hapfjens, a wraparound effect will occur. Therefore, translation 
works best with small images, having room to move. 

Objcolor. This determines what the object's color will be when it is 
drawn if color was not specified when the image was created. If color was 
specified, then objcolor is ignored. The standard GraForth color num- 
bers (1 through 7) are used. Note that objcolor also sets the normal color 
command, so be sure to reset color to the desired value after using 
objcolor. 

Table 1 shows the 3-D parameters and the range of values they use. 
Let's try some examples. First, we need a 3-D object to work with;

As we present word definitions, you'll probably want to use the edi- 
tor to enter the definitions, then compile them into the word library us- 
ing memrd. Then you can experiment with the definitions by changing 
some of the parameters from the editor and recompiling. Of course, you 
can also type the word definitions directly into GraForth from the key- 
board. 

Creating animations with GraForth's 3-D graphics is easy and 
straightforward. As we mentioned in an earlier column, animation is 
simply a series of still pictures displayed rapidly one after another, pro- 
viding the effect of movement. One fast way to generate this movement is

with a do— loop 

257 0 DO I YROT DRAW 4 +LOOP 

This example rotates the object a full circle around the Y axis. Since 
the loop is in steps of four, it repeats 64 times, producing 64 separate 
draws, one after another. For each draw, the rotation around the Y axis 
is set to the loop value, incrementing from 0 to 256. 

This type of animation is straightforward, but for most applications a 
number of parameters need to be manipulated at once. Let's look at how 
to do more complicated manipulations with a few examples. 

When using a do— loop, usually one draw will be performed each time 
through the loop. The size of the loop then determines how many times 
the object will be drawn. To change the parameters, two approaches are 
possible: the loop value can be used to generate the desired parameter 
values, or separate variables can be used to keep track of each pa- 
rameter. 

In the first method, the conversion from loop value to parameter 
value is done with short formulas. For example, if you want the tetra- 
hedron to rotate around the Y axis three times for each rotation around 
the X axis, you can use this routine: 

: THREE.ROT 
257 0 DO 

I XROT 

I 3 * YROT 

DRAW 
2 +LOOP ; 

After entering three. rot into the editor and compiling (or entering it di- 
rectly from the keyboard), it can be run by simply typing 

THREE.ROT 

The trick is to find the right formula for the desired motion. Sup- 
pose, with the above example, you also wanted to make the tetrahedron 
grow in size from 12 scale to 20 scale. The change from 0 to 256 in the 
loop must be translated to a change from 12 to 20. Note that the differ- 
ence between the start and end loop values is 256, and the difference in 
the scales is 8. If we divide the loop value by 32, we get a range of 0 to 8. 
If we then add 12, we get the desired range of 12 to 20: 

Loop value 0 / 32 = 0 ... 0 + 12 = 12 Scale value 
Loop value 256 / 32 = 8 ... 8 + 12 = 20 Scale value 

The new routine looks like this: 

: ROT&SCALE 
257 0 DO 

I YROT 

I 3 * XROT 

I 32 / 12 + SCALE 

DRAW 
LOOP ; 

Now we'll look at a program adapted from the "rolling tetrahe- 
dron" display in the GraForth demonstration program. The tetrahedron 
moves down and to the right, rotates end over end, and grows and 
shrinks, giving the appearance of rolling closer, then farther away. You 
can use this routine with any image in memory.

None of these formulas were arrived at by magic. As the routine was 
written, we tweaked each formula until we got the desired display. Here 
are the numbers that come out: 

Loop value: 0 to 36 

XROT: 0 to 108 

YROT: 0 to 180 

XPOS: 25 to 241 

YPOS: 35 to 143 

SCALE: 0 to 18, then back to 0 

The scaling formula deserves more comment. The desired effect was 
to have the object grow and then shrink. We could have used two scal- 
ing loops one after another — the first increasing and the next decreasing. 
But then we would have had to keep all the other parameters moving 
smoothly through the transition from one loop to the next, without a 
skip in values. For simplicity, we decided to use a single loop. 

With the loop value moving from 0 to 36, we wanted the scaling func- 
tion to slide from 0 to 18 and back to 0. This can be shown with figure 1 . 
Figure 2 shows the steps we used to achieve the effect. 

Sometimes a more complicated animation cannot be performed in- 
side a simple do— loop. This is especially true if the user is interacting 
with the program through a joystick or keyboard, and the program must 
make decisions. In this case, it's often best to use separate variables to 
keep track of each parameter. The parameters can then be updated at 
any time from the running program. The following program duplicates 
the Roll.Tetra routine using this technique.

We used a do -loop to run the animation since no branching deci- 
sions were needed for this program. If they were required, the current 
value of any 3-D parameter would always be available. 

For smooth animation, the GraForth 3-D graphics routines auto- 
matically take advantage of both hi-res screen pages in the Apple mem- 
ory. During 3-D animations, one screen area is displayed while the other 
is being invisibly updated. This way, the lines are not shown being erased 
and redrawn. This is only true for 3-D graphics. GraForth text printing, 
line drawing, and character graphics always draw to both screens simul- 
taneously. In this way, the screen-flipping 3-D graphics can be mixed 
with other kinds of graphics without causing lines and characters to re- 
peatedly appear and disappear. 

The sequence GraForth uses in putting a 3-D object on the screen is a 
four-step process: whenever the word draw is executed, the drawing rou- 
tines are first directed to the graphics screen that is not currently being 
displayed. Then the previous 3-D objects are individually erased line by 
line by following the parameters that were originally used to draw them. 
Next, the new objects are drawn on the screen using the current parame- 
ters. Lastly, the display is switched to this screen, so that the new objects 
can be seen. 

To increase speed, the word draw only works with the objects that 
have been referenced since the last draw command. This reference can be 
made by giving the object one or more new parameters, or by simply 
calling it again with object. This means that objects that don't need to be 
changed can be left on the screen as they are and will not slow the draw- 
ing of objects still in motion. 

Suppose you're manipulating two 3-D objects (call them objects 1 
and 2) simultaneously. First, both of them are in motion, and the ani- 
mation toggles between the two graphics screens with each draw com-

mand. Then you decide to stop the motion of object 1 , while continuing 
object 2. To do this, you simply stop giving object 1 any new com- 
mands. Since object 1 was previously in motion, the picture of the object 
on the two graphics screens is different. As the animation continues with 
object 2, the display will switch back and forth between the two screens. 
The two pictures of object 1 will alternate back and forth, rather than re- 
maining still. 

The solution to this problem is simple: when you don't need to move 
an object any more, give it one extra object command, without any new 
parameters: 

1 OBJECT 

This will cause the same picture of the object to be drawn on the sec- 
ond graphics screen. The two pictures of the object will then be identical, 
and the object will remain still while other objects are manipulated.

Moving Faster. With a little extra planning, the speed of 3-D graph- 
ics can often be increased considerably. The line-by-line undrawing of 
each 3-D object uses as much time as drawing the new object. A faster 
method to remove old images is simply to erase the area of the screen the 
object lies in, and then not to bother doing a line-by-line erase. 

The GraForth word undraw is designed for doing just this. Undraw 
erases a portion of the screen just as unblk does, on a character-size ba- 
sis. However, undraw also sets a flag telling GraForth not to do a line- 
by-line erase of the 3-D object. After setting the block size and the posi- 
tion appropriately, you can erase the object yourself, so that the 3-D rou- 
tines don't have to erase it. This method requires that you know what 
rectangular area of the screen is used by the object and that no other 
graphics lie in this area, since they would also be erased. 

Here is an example of using undraw. Starting from scratch, let's first 
get an object onto the screen:

CR 132 PUTC PRINT " BLOAD CUBE,A2816 " CR 

OBJERASE

20 XROT 20 YROT

An easy way to determine the block size and placement to use with 
undraw is to fill the screen with characters, then draw the object over 
them: 

0 VTAB 1000 0 DO 110 MOD . LOOP 0 OBJECT DRAW 

By simply counting down and across, you can see that the cube fills a 
block nine characters wide by eight characters tall, starting at 8 vtab 14 
htab. The undraw command can be used to erase this block during a 3-D 
animation: 

ERASE 

9 8 BLKSIZE 

Now type this entire line, and then press the return key. 

8 VTAB 14 HTAB 257 0 DO I YROT UNDRAW DRAW 4 +LOOP 
18 VTAB 

This sets the character position for the block and rotates the object 
while erasing the block with undraw. Compare it with the same loop 
without undraw. 

257 0 DO I YROT DRAW 4 +LOOP 

The difference in speed is quite noticeable. 

Next month, we'll continue with 3-D graphics, describing Gra- 
Forth's internal 3-D object table and the format for 3-D images in mem- 
ory. We'll also include a space shuttle simulation program, with a com- 
plete discussion of how it works. JW

ventures with 
VisiCalc 



BV )OE SUELTOH 



VisiCalc has become a very useful tool in the corporate world. If 
you're a person who takes advantage of the program's capabilities on a 
regular basis, then you're well aware of how easy it is to use VisiCalc as a 
means of quantifying information for decision-making purposes. Look 
again at last month's discussion of decision matrix and probability value 
matrix and you'll see a couple of ways of using VisiCalc in this fashion. 
And, as you probably know, VisiCalc can also help you arrive at quanti- 
tative answers. 

But there are still ways of using VisiCalc to make your life 
easier. This month we'll focus on some ways you can use the program to 
help you make decisions at home and in your personal life. After con- 
sidering the examples offered here, you may see other ways of using 
VisiCalc — ways that might not otherwise have occurred to you. 

We'll also look this month at a couple of problems you'll run into in 
one of the templates and see whether we can come up with any good 
solutions. We'll end this discussion with another problem. Then next 
time we'll compare notes on how we solved it. 

Building a Bookcase. Suppose you're getting ready to build a book- 
case. Having measured the area in which you plan to place the book- 
case, you know that your creation can be eight feet high by four feet wide 
by one foot deep. 

What you need to do now is determine how many shelves you can 
put in a bookcase this size. One method of determining how many shelves 
would be to take pencil, paper, and ruler and draw the bookcase to scale. 
You'd then be able to draw in shelves at different heights to simulate 
how the bookcase would look, and if you didn't like the configuration, 
you could just erase the shelves and draw them in again in different 
places. Another simple method of approadiing this problem would be to 
cut out strips of paper to represent shelves. You could then move these 
around until you'd determined the optimum configuration for your 
bookcase. Not exactly a quick method of accomplishing the task, but it's 
easy and anyone can do it. 

Obviously, VisiCalc can help you accomplish the same thing (why 
else would we be discussing it?). So, let's explore how VisiCalc can help. 

To simplify matters, let's suppose that our bookcase frame consists 
of a bottom shelf, a top shelf, and left and right sides. There's space in the 
middle for our shelves. 

When you think about it, arranging the shelves becomes a mathemat- 
ical proposition. There's a limited space bounded by the top and bot- 
tom shelves; and in this area we're going to put shelves of a predeter- 
mined thickness. Each shelf will define a height limit for books. So, each 
time we (mathematically) install a shelf, the remaining space is decreased 
by the total of the shelfs thickness and the book area it bounds. As you 
see, we have now taken what was essentially a visual problem and quan- 
tified it. 

Of course, the important factor from a template /bookcase de- 
signer's standpoint is the distance between shelves. That's what deter- 
mines the height of the books that can be included. The template we 
create, then, must use the distance between shelves as the determinant. 

It's time to try it. Boot VisiCalc and let's begin. 

Rows 3 and 4 will be our variable section. Variables will be the height 
of the bookcase and the thickness of the shelves. If we decide to do a dif-

ferent bookcase in the future, we'll only have to change these two pa- 
rameters. Cell B4 is where we will compute the number of shelves we'll 
have to purchase. 

In columns C, D, E, and F we will do the computations. 

Enter the information shown in figure I. 

Column C will be the scratch area where we will enter the height that 
we require for books on each shelf. Columns D and E will provide the 
necessary calculations, and column F will tell us how much space re- 
mains. Once the template is completed, you can enter as many iterations 
of book heights as you desire until you have determined the best shelf 
configuration. 

Since all of our shelf computations will be in inches, we need to con- 
vert the height of the bookcase, expressed in feet at B3, to inches — at D3. 

We'll start our layout from the bottom of the template. That is a 
logical place to begin; records and large books are heaviest and take up 
the largest space, so we'll allow for them first. 

Arbitrarily, in this model we'll allow for eleven shelves. We'll start by 
allowing for the thickness of the bottom shelf. Then we'll add other 
shelves. 

In D20, enter -I-B4. This cell will always hold the value of the initial 
shelf thickness. As you begin designing your bookcase, you'll be enter- 
ing the book height for the bottom shelf in C20, the book height for the 
next shelf in C19, and so on. But don't enter any of those values yet. 

Column D will be used to compute the distance from the bottom of 
the bookcase to the top of the highest shelf. Column E will compute the 
top of the bottom shelf (column D) plus the book height for the next 
shelf plus the thickness of the next shelf. Since we have already entered a 
cell reference in D20, in cell E20 enter -l-D20-l-C20-f-B4. That will total 
the thickness of the bottom and top shelves, plus the book height. 

In column F we'll show the total space remaining. That is the total 
available space (the height of the bookcase) minus space already allotted. 
The formula at F20 is -I-D3-E20. 

At Dl 9 enter -I- E20. This will show the height of the current shelf and 
allow the computation for the next shelf. 

Now replicate the formulas at D19, E20, and F20 up to row 10. Be 
sure to replicate references to D3 and B4 with no change. Now the cal- 
culating part of the template is finished and you can begin entering book 
height values (in inches) in column C. Work your way up from C20 and 
notice the results. If you press the recalculation key (!) a number of times, 
you will see the values continue to change. That's because this template

includes recursive references. Later in this article we'll examine the mat- 
ter of recursive references in greater depth. 

The last step in the construction of our bookshelf template is to deter- 
mine the number of shelves we need to buy. In cell B5 enter 
@COUNT(C9...C21)+l. This will give us the total number of shelves 
necessary, including the top and bottom shelves. 

Once you've completed this template, save it to disk. We'll return to 
it later. 

MPG. Here's another template; you can use this one as a tool for un- 
derstanding more about the health of your car and about the operating 
cost associated with keeping it in good running order. 

Most of us have a certain amount of awareness about how well the 
car we drive is running. And when the car begins to run abnormally — 
when it's slow to start, idles too slow or too fast, or accelerates poorly — 
we usually notice. But it's sometimes much more difficult to tell when a 
car is just beginning to go out of tune. 

One way to get some indication of how well or poorly your car is 
running is by keeping a continuous record of how many miles it gets to a 
gallon of gas. By keeping such a record, you'll be able to see when your 
mileage begins to drop; often this drop in mpg happens long before you 
begin to notice any real difference in the way the car drives. 

Of course, you will have to be able to take into account the type of 
driving you did on a particular tankful. If you did mostly around-town 
driving, you can expect a lower mpg rate; conversely, of course, you can 
expect a much better rate on steady-speed road trips. In addition, check- 
ing the mpg requires knowing the capacity of your car's gas tank, filling 
your gas tank to some measurable point every time, keeping totals of the 
mileage driven and the gasoline consumed between fill-ups. And, of 
course, if you're going to look at the cost of operating your car, you'll 
need to keep track of what the gasoline costs each time you fill the tank. 

The template is very simple. First enter the column headings shown 
in figure 2. 

In E3 enter -I-B3/C3 and replicate that down the column to El 3 or as 
far as you like. It's not necessary to replicate it very far, though; you can 
always replicate it for additional rows later. 



Miles/ 

Date Tank Gallons Cost MPG 
Figure 2. 



Now, each time you fill your tank, you can compute your average 
mpg. You'll see some variation in this figure depending on whether you 
take lots of short trips or a few longer ones on a tank of gas. When it has 
been a while since you last had your car tuned up, your mileage will start 
to drop. Then when you have your next tune-up, your mpg figure should 
increase again. 

Once you're aware of the range of mileage your car achieves, it's rela- 
tively easy to take mpg into account when you're evaluating the health of 
your car. If you wanted, you could also keep track of the kind of mile- 
age you get when you buy various brands of gasoline to see if one brand 
actually gives you better mileage than another. 

That was easy. Would you like to continue building the template as 
an aid to understanding the total cost involved in operating your car? 
You might be surprised at how expensive (or inexpensive) operating a 
car can be. 

The real measure of the expense of operating a car is cost per mile. Of 
course, it's possible to measure cost per year instead. 

There are two variables involved in the expanse of operating a car. 
The first is the variable expense of the actual operation. This includes 
gas, oil, tires, and so on. The second category is fixed expenses. These are 
the expenses you'd incur even if you didn't drive your car. Included in the 
category are insurance, registration costs, garage costs, and various other 
expenses. You can see that because there's very little operating expense 
involved, a car that isn't being driven much would have a much lower to- 
tal cost than one that gets driven a lot. But the first car would have a very 
high cost per mile. 

In Fl and F2, enter Operating and Costs. If you wanted, you could

create a different column for each type of operating cost and then total 
them in a Total Operating Costs column. 

In Gl and G2, enter Ttl Op and Costs (Total Operating Costs). In H 1 
and H2, enter Fixed and Costs. And finally, in II and 12, enter Ttl Cst 
and / Mile (and don't forget to put in the quotes before the slash). Your 
template should look like figure 3. 

In G3 enter +D3+F3 and in 13 enter +G3+H3/B3. You won't en- 
ter anything in columns F and H until you actually incur an expense, 
such as having to pay an insurance premium. 

When you enter information in column H or column F, you'll find 
an immediate novelty. The Total Cost per Mile in cases where there are 
entries in H or F is very high. The next fuel entry brings the average for 
that fill-up back to normal. What do we do? 

The answer is that we must look at total mileage versus total cost 
rather than looking for each individual entry. Insert two columns, one for 
a running mileage total and one for a running cost total. The formulas 
will be the last mileage (or cost) plus the current mileage (or cost). In the 
Ttl Cst/Mile column, divide the running cost total by the running 
mileage total and you have a running cost per mile. 

A Thousand and One Uses. So far we have examined two somewhat 
unusual ways of using VisiCalc for fun and personal advantage. There 
are many more. For example, VisiCalc can be used to analyze tennis 
matches, football games, baseball games, and other sporting events. Its 
uses are limited only by your imagination. When you think of some good 
ones, write in to tell other readers about them. 

Bookcases and Problems. If you saved the template we used to de- 
sign our bookcase, load it now; we're about to use it again. If you haven't 
completed the template, consider doing so now; you'll get a lot more out 



of this section once you have the completed template ready to go. 

As we have done in previous installments of this column, we're going 
to look at a couple of problems with the template and attempt to 
solve them. 

The most obvious problem in this template is the number of recal- 
culations you must do every time you change the height, the width, or 
number of the shelves. Experiment, by changing one of these variables, 
and recalculate until you see no more changes to be made in the tem- 
plate. You'll notice that changing the bookcase height requires only one 
recalculation to correct the values in the template completely, while the 
other two variables require numerous recalculations. 

Any time you encounter this problem in a template, change the order 
of recalculation (/GOR or /GOQ and test the template again. VisiCalc 
begins calculations from the top and either calculates across each row 
going down the template or down each column going across the tem- 
plate, depending on the order of recalculation. Sometimes, changing the 
order of recalculation will completely solve the problem. If it doesn't, 
one of the two possibilities will usually alleviate the need for some of the 
recalculations. 

If you look at the formulas in columns D, E, and F starting in row 19, 
you'll see that each entry requires the entry below to be completed before 
the next entry can be computed. This means that, when each row is re- 
calculated, it uses an unrecalculated value in the row below. It then 
recalculates the value in the lower row. The value displayed in the row 
above is incorrect, while the value in the lower row is now correct. It 
takes another recalculation finally to display a correct value in the higher 
row. If you imagine ten rows, each requiring a recalculation, you can see 
that it could take up to ten recalculations for the template to be correct. 

How do we fix this? Ideally, we initially design our template so that 
all references to other cells are either to the right of or below the cell with 
the formula. This isn't always possible, but there is a way to simulate it. 
This requires an "anti-recursive" table. This kind of table starts with the 
lowest shelf at the top of the template and each successive shelf one row 
down. In this manner, each recalculation works down the template, 
avoiding any recursive tendencies. In order to eliminate yet another

recursive tendency, the anti-recursive table should be above the final 
table. 

Of course, using the anti-recursive table alone is counter-intuitive to 
the user (you'd be entering the lower shelves at the top of the template), 
so the template must have a section where each required cell is refer- 
enced in the original order. Graphically, we can illustrate this as shown in 
figure 4. 

As a simulation of our shelf template, formula 1 in Al would com- 
pute the lowest shelf, with formula 2 determining the next highest, and so 
on. The first cell in the user table references the lowest cell in the anti- 
recursive table, and each cell down the table references a successively 
higher cell in the anti-recursive table. In our example, the references in 
All, A12, and A13 reference the cells in the anti-recursive table in 
reverse order. All computation and references in this model are started at 
the top of column A and worked to the bottom. 

Too Much To Look At. When you review the template, you'll see 
values shown in every cell that contains a formula. Even the cells that 
have no shelf entered in column C display a value. While this doesn't 
affect the usefulness of the template, it leaves much to be desired 
esthetically. There are many times when it would be nice to be able to 
display 0, rather than a value. 

In our shelf analysis, the factor that decides whether useful values or 
just "fall-through" values are displayed in columns D, E, and F is the 
presence of an entry in column C.

Let's see if there is a simple method of displaying 0 instead of a fall- 
through value. We'll take cell FIO as our example. We can use the 
©LOOKUP function to match the value computed by the formula in 
FIO (that is, -I-D3-E10) against a look-up table. The look-up formula in 
FIO and look-up table (with formulas rather than values displayed) 
would look like figure 5. 

The look-up formula looks for a value equal to either D3-EI0 or D3 
(because ElO has a value of 0 once it has been set up with a ©LOOKUP 
to make it 0 if there isn't a value in CIO). If it finds a value equal to 
D3-E10, the look-up formula returns the value in HIO, or D3-E10. If it 
finds a value equal to D3, it will return a 0. So, if you followed all that, 
and assuming all the cells have been modified, if there is no value in CIO, 
then there will be no value in FIO. If you enter a value in CIO, FIO will 
display the correct value. 

Can you see a problem with this solution? Each cell in columns D, E, 
and F would now require four additional cells for the look-up table. 
With three columns and eleven cells per column, that equals thirty-three 
cells requiring four cells each, or 132 cells for look-up tables alone. Clear- 
ly, this qualifies as a case of the tail wagging the dog! 

Surely there is a simpler way? There is! The magic ©IF function per- 
mits a simple and elegant solution. Think about what we are trying to ac- 
complish. If there's no value in CIO, we want to display a 0; otherwise we 
want to display the result of the equation +D3— ElO. In VisiCalc ver- 
nacular, that translates to @IF(C10=0,0,D3-E10). Does that accom- 
plish what we asked? If there is no value entered in C 10, then CIO equals 
0 and the ©IF will return 0. Otherwise, the ©IF will return D3-E10. If 
you use the same function on all the cells in the table, you will see the re- 
sults we are looking for. 

A Challenge! Okay, you have been an interested, but passive, reader 
so far. We're going to look now at a problem that happens often in tem- 
plates and your challenge is to solve it. Relax, you have a month! Ac- 
tually, it's a simple problem, although the solution may require a bit of 
experimentation. Look at figure 6. 

This is a sales analysis for a company |hat sells copiers. The compa- 
ny is responsible for three areas. Sales reps have been hired to cover the 
three areas and the sales manager is trying to decide whether to hire more 
sales people to cover area 3. He is questioning whether salespeople 
actually contribute enough business to warrant adding more of them. 
The sales in area 3 are all from responses to national advertising by the 
parent company. 

The sales manager has entered the values in columns B and C. The 
formula in column D is column B/column C (for example, +B4/C4). 
Since there are no sales reps in area 3, VisiCalc gives a division by zero 
error. When the sales manager tries to average column D in D7, the re- 
sult he gets is another ERROR. 

The sales manager could ignore the ERROR and enter an average of 
area 1 and area 2 sales reps (for example, (+D4+D5)/2), but he would 
like to be able to expand and use the template when he becomes nation- 
al sales manager in a few months. 

Can you fix the template so that any ERRORs that show in column 
D do not affect the formula in D7? The solution will appear in next 
month's column. m

For example, you can

DISKETTE COPY-PROTECTION 
AND DUPLICATION SYSTEMS 
FOR THE APPLE COMPUTER 



The Lock-lt-Up systems are sophisticated, menu 
driven copy-protection and duplication utilities for the 
Apple II Computer. They feature several levels of pro- 
tection which make standard diskettes uncopyable by 
even the most sophisticated nibble copy programs 
currently available. 

• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Data files can be loaded and/or saved to either the pro- 
tected diskette or an unprotected diskette. 

• Memory will be cleared and the disk w^ill reboot if the reset 
key is pushed. 

• The copying systems support up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data-verification is optional during copy. 

• Sequential serial numbers are assigned to each diskette 
produced by the system. 

• Master diskettes created with the system contain an I.D. 
stamp that you select. The I.D. stamp must be correctly 
specified before any diskettes can be duplicated. This pre- 
vents other Lock-lt-Up owners from copying your diskettes. 

• Extensive support is provided should you have any prob- 
lems or special needs. 

• Our system is supported by numerous disk copying services 
should you need a large quantity of diskettes duplicated. 

Either system is available for $225, which includes three diskettes, an 
informative manual, and a non-exclusive license to copy as many 
diskettes as needed.

IF YOU'RE CONFUSED 
PERSONAL COMPUTER, 



At this moment, there are no 
less than 50 personal computers 
on the market. And more are 
being introduced every day. 

On one hand, having all those 
options is a good thing. On the 
other, it can make picking the 
right one pretty difficult. 




Start by making a list of the 
things you want to use the com- 
puter for. It can include almost 
anything-any kind of inventory 
filing, accounting, graphics, 
reporting, record-keeping, 
analysis -you name it and there's 
probably a software program that 
does it. 

Next, take the list into a com- 
puter store and ask the salesper- 
son to give you a demonstration 
of the program, or programs 
that will do the things you 
want. 

Even though you'll 
need a computer 
for the software 
demonstia- 



Computers come in two parts. 
You have to buy both. 

Wed like to help. So here are a 
few suggestions about how to buy 
the computer that's right for you. 
Computers come in two pairts. 

One part is the "hardware," 
which is the machinery itself. The 
other is the "software," or a pro- 
gram, as it's sometimes called. 

Software is the part that tells 
the computer what to do, the way 
a driver tells a car what to do. 

Without software, a computer 
can't do anything. 

And vice versa. 

You have to buy both. 
Buy the software first. 

Since the reason you're buying 
a computer is to get the capability 
the software gives you (remember, 
it's the software that knows how 
to get things done), it makes 
good sense to pick the 
software first, 



tion, keep ia mind the computer 
is just a vehicle. The software is 
the driver. And once you've 
decided on the software, picking 
out the rest of the computer sys- 
tem will be much easier. 
The simpler the better. 

Look for software that's easy to 
learn, easy to use, and that does 
the job in the simplest way 
possible. 

Good personal soft- 
ware should be, as the 
computer people say 
"friendly." Meaning 
that it helps you 
do what you 
have to do 
without get- 
ting in the 
X way 

\ 




Mean- 
ing there 
are no com- 
plicated routines 
to follow to perform 
a simple task. And no 
programming 
language to learn. 
Some people, how- 
ever, will tell you that soft- 
ware has to be compli- 
cated to be powerful. 

Nothing could be far- 
ther from the truth. 
Because in order for a 
program to appear simple 
to you on the outside, it has to 
be extremely complex on 
the inside. 



ABOUT BUYING A 
HERirS SOME HELR 



Good software keeps the com- 
plications in the computer, where 
they belong. And keeps the capa- 
bility at your fingertips. It's that 
simple. 

You simply have to see 
for yoursell 

You can read any number of 
interesting books and magazines 
about personal computers. You 
can ask friends who have them. 
You can look at all the sales litera- 
ture you can get your hands on. 
And you should do all those 
things before you decide to buy 

But as helpflil as all that can be, 
there really is no substitute for a 
real, live demonstration. 

When you do go out shopping, 
we recommend you take a look at 
the PFS® Family of Software. 

The PFS family is designed the 
way we think all software should 
be: simple, straightforward and 
powerful. 

Currently three products 
make up the family PFS:FILE, 
PFS:REPORT and PFS:GRAPH, 
with more programs on the way 
Here's a little more about each 
of them. 

PFSrFILE. The simplest way 
to get organized. 

Basically FILE works like a 
paper filing system, without the 
paper So you can record, file, 
retrieve and review information in 
a fraction of the time it takes with 
a conventional filing system. 

FILE lets you arrange your 
information in "forms" you design 
yourself. So you can get at and 
really use your information in ^ 
ways never before possible. 

What's more, FILE lets you 
change the original form without 
having to redo the information on it. 



PFS:R£PORT. Making the most 
of your information. 

REPORT summarizes the 
information on your forms so you 
can use it to analyze, plan and 
make better-informed decisions. 

With REPORT, you get presen- 
tation-quality reports-sorted, cal- 
culated, formatted and printed- 
automatically in seconds. 
PFS:GRAPH. Instant pictures. 

GRAPH gives you presentation 
quality bar charts, line graphs, 
and pie charts, in black and white 
or color, on paper or the com- 
puter screen. To get a clearer 
picture of things and spot frends 
instantly you simply enter your 
information and specify the kind 
of graph or chart you want. 
GRAPH does the rest. 

You can also mix and match 
line and bar graphs, or even stack 
or compare up to four bar graphs 
simultaneously. 

And GRAPH will work with 
PFS:FILE, VisiCalc® files, or data 
entered directly into the 
computer. 

Best of aU, compared to the 
cost of hand-drawn graphics, 
GRAPH can save you enough 
money over the course of a few 
months to pay for the computer it 
runs on.

TEST-FLY 
A '20 MILUON JET 
ON AN APPLE? 

YES. WITH MICROSPEED. 




At the Bethesda Naval Research Center, they've 
discovered the power of MicroSPEED. The Navy's 
engineers use this remarkable hardware/software 
combination to "fly" an advanced fighter aircraft 
in real time — even making vertical landings on a 
simulated carrier deck. A "crash" is merely another 
learning experience, and an opportunity to modify 
the research aircraft — inside the Apple — to improve 
tomorrow's combat planes. 

Surprised that such a sophisticated task is possible 
on the Apple? So were the Navy's officials, and many 
others who have discovered... 

THE MICROSPEED DIFFERENCE This extraordinary 
Language System exploits the real potential of the 
microcomputer for the first time. The difference 
between MicroSPEED and other programming lan- 
guages is that with MicroSPEED, there is virtually no 
limit to what you can achieve. It may well be the 
ultimate language for the Apple II and III (and soon 
the IBM Personal Computer). MicroSPEED literally 
combines the performance of a minicomputer with 
an exhaustive set of user-friendly capabilities: hard- 



ware math processing, fast hi-res graphics and text, 
turtle graphics, print formating, two text editors, 
unlimited data types, and incredible FORTH extensi- 
bility—all at speeds up to 100 times faster than Basic. 

USER-FRIENDLY, EASY-TO-LEARN Starting with 
simple commands that are comfortable even for 
non-programmers, MicroSPEED extends and builds, 
allowing you to create your own tailored application 
languages. The capability of your computer will 
grow exponentially, as you work in an active part- 
nership with the machine, exploring and develop- 
ing new problem-solving facilities — creating, cor- 
recting, refining your increasingly powerful system. 

DEMANDING JOBS AT LOW COST Developed 
by a team of standout computer professionals, 
MicroSPEED has been put to the test in fields as 
diverse as medicine, the stock market, oceanography, 
and the arts. In even the most challenging appli- 
cations, MicroSPEED users have been unanimous 
in their praise of the System and manual. Typical 
comments are: 




"Very high marks" 

Thomas Tosch Phd., Tosch Information Management. 

"The more I use MicroSPEED, the more I love it" 
James L. Hockenhull, University of Washington. 
"Great!. . .A joy to use" 

Heniy Harris, Mission Designer, Cal Tech's Jet Propulsion Lab. 

"If you plan to use the Apple or IBM Personal 
Computer for any demanding task, then we built 
MicroSPEED for you" 

Sam Cottrell, President of Applied Analytics. 



MicroSPEED requires the Apple Computer with single disk. MicroSPEED 
II includes 2 MHz math processor. MicroSPEED II + includes 4 MHz 
math processor.

APPLE IS A TRADEMARK OF APPLE COMPUTER INC 



You're not alone, you know. 

We've all been through that same excru- 
ciating moment when we realized that we were 
going to have to learn a lot more than we wanted 
to know about programming, in self-defense. 

But most of us survived. 

Many of us with a little bit of help called 
dBASE II, the relational database management 
system (DBMS) for micros. 

The best defense is a strong offense. 

Don't get seduced by BASIC, because 
basically BASIC is weak. And to make it do 
anything useful can take 10 times as much 
programming (and time) as with dBASE II. 

dBASE II is much easier because it's a 
relational DBMS, and you control your informa- 
tion with powerful, English-like commands. 

With a word or two, you CREATE data- 
bases, APPEND new data, UPDATE, MODIFY 
and REPLACE fields, records and entire data- 
bases. DISPLAY some or all of your data for 
any conditions you want to apply. Organize 
months worth of data in minutes with REPORT. 

You can prepare your forms and formats 
precisely the way you want them. Do calcula- 
tions on fields, records and entire databases 
with 10-place accuracy. 

And do even more with dozens of other 
commands. 

Here's the catch. 

With any language, you'll need to under- 
stand relational operators ("less than" "greater 
than;' "equals") and a bit of logic ("or!' "and;' "not"). 

With dBASE II, you'll also get an easy 
way to make choices (IF. .THEN. .ELSE) and a 
powerful way to perform repetitive tasks 
(DO WHILE..). 



m to get 

Op. 

your ru 




With these tools, you're ready to tackle 
your accounting and time billing, project man- 
agement, and any other data handling and record 
keeping. You can work interactively and get your 
answers right now. Or save your instructions and 
repeat everything with two words: DO Man- 
hours, DO ProjectX, DO whatever has to be done. 

Use dBASE II to help make your choice. 

If you've got a 48k CP/M micro with a 
disk drive (96k IBM PC), send us $700 ($400 
for a 56k Apple). We'll send you a copy of 
dBASE II to use free for 30 days. 



the best of 
t micro. 




Instead of just poring over a manual, run 
it and make certain that dBASE II does what you 
need done. 

Then if you find it isn't right for you, 
send it back and we'll return your money, no 
questions asked. 

But we know that you'll probably keep it. 

Because having dBASE II is like having 
a black belt in micros. 

Call (213) 204.-5570 today or drop by your 
local computer store for the rest of the story.

Do n't let this pretty little package fool you. What was inside can add up to more than 
you'd ever expect. For your APPLE II* it can mean an additional 128K of memory, an 80- 
column display that knows no equal, and ultra-fast disk drive emulation. 

We think you'll agree the STB-128 Multi-Purpose Memory Board (6499) and the 
STB-80 Video Board (6299) together might have been enough to fill the package. But we've 
slipped in a present to you — the STB VC-Extender* software (699) that lets VisiCalc* 3.3 use 
the added memory of the STB-128 to create and save models as large as 138K. Also, the 
expanded display capabilities of the STB-80 may be used to view twice the model area, 
and with lower case characters! This software is a gift when you buy the two boards 
as a package. 

Other fine products from STB include the STB-16/64- expandable RAM boards 
(6169/6299) and numerous software support packages. Our 64K and 128K RAM boards 
include a free DOS 3.3 support diskette with disk emulation software. PASCAL and CP/M* 
support programs are also available.

we quickly realized 
that you share 
this ambition. 

Today, four 
years later,

IT'S A JUNGLE 
IN THERE. 




There's an untamed jungle insideyourApple 11, lurking 
behind the facade of familiar Applesoft Basic. A place 
populated by unfriendly natives like carry flags, binary 
numbers, and indirect addressing modes. Where the 
only laws are the complex and mysterious ways of 
the 6502 microprocessor. 

For years Apple owners trying to learn 6502 machine 
language had a tough time in this jungle, forced to 
hack their way through one slippery new concept after 
another. 

Now there's an easier path through the machine lan- 
guage jungle. A path that anyone comfortable with 
Basic can follow. 

The Visible Computer: 6502 is a unique new program 
that teaches machine language programming. It com- 
bines a hi-res 6502 simulation with an extensive 
user manual/tutorial to provide the easiest way yet to 
come up to speed on machine language. 

The Visible Computer is like a microscope that lets 
you see inside a 6502 as it executes programs. 

You'll watch the registers change as instructions are 
performed. You'll see how instructions are executed 
-- not just their results. You control how fast or slow 
TVC runs. And it can't crash, no matter what. 

Once you've earned your stripes as a machine lan- 
guage programmer, you can use TVC as a powerful 
debugging tool, with features veteran programmers 
appreciate, like: On-line 4 function calculator; 
single step and 6502 modes; disassembler; flexi- 
ble register and memory display. 

Req.: 48K Apple II Plus • One Drive • Printer Opt.

The KEL-CO SYSTEM, developed by Dr. A.S. Kelsey, Professor of Mathematics, and Mike Cox, an expert in horse race handicapping, has been 
available separately for Thoroughbred and Harness racing since the late 1960'sand has increased in popularity as the technical presentation of 
It has improved. 

The in depth analysis of 10,000 races for each of Thoroughbred and Harness racing was conducted to determine which measurable variables 
were most predictive and which of the intangibles could be organized into a workable form. 

CANIMELLA SALES CORP. NOW INTRODUCES TWO KEL-CO SOFTWARE PACKAGES FOR ANALYSING 

THOROUGHBRED AND HARNESS HORSES! 

THE PROGRAMS 

Because of Computer technology, a novice need only learn how to interpret the racing papers (clear instructions included) to operate these 
programs. You'll enjoy becoming a RailbirdI 



THOROUGHBRED PROGRAM (RS-5): Horses' ratings reflect 
True Class levels. The Program takes into account the levels of 
racing at all North American racetracks so that ratings always 
remain consistent; Fitness of the horse is also a major element 
brought out in the analysis. Ratings may then be adjusted in 
consideration of factors like Distance, Weight, Surface etc. 



TROT PROGRAM (RS-6): Horses' ratings are derived through the 
mathematical links among Speed, Finishes, Post Positions and Track 
Lengths. Adjustments are then made for Current Form, Class 
Changes, Driver Changes etc. This method can be used at any 
Harness racetrack for which normal past performance data is avail- 
able. 



INPUT/OUTPUT — The Programs operate on the basis of prompts where the user responds with material from the racing papers, and in some 
cases personal judgement. 

Results may be produced one horse at a time or for complete races; horses are rated, ranked and qualified on a list (screen copy or hard copy). 
Wagering guidelines for Straight-Win, Place, Show and Combination Bets, eg. Daily Doubles, Exactas — are given in the Programs. These rules 
are applied in accordance with the horses' ratings and qualifications.

The Pizza Program 

Announcing the first dinner menu planning system. 
It will save you time and add new zest to your meals. 
It may even convince your wife buying an Apple* 
was a stroke of genius. 



ENDS HO-HUM DINNERS 

Are you tired of the same old 
thing for dinner? Would you like 
more variety m your evening 
meal? Is there something you'd 
rather have but don't get very 
often'f' The Pizza Program is 
designed just for you- It's a de- 
lightful new software package 
designed to end the dinner-blahs 
with computer generated menus- 
Here is how it works. 

You review what you like from 
the pre-selected food groups in 
the system. Delete any foods 
you don't enjoy. Add anything 
new at any time. Then decide 
how often you like to eat certain 
items. For example. Don't like 
liver? Then eliminate it with a few 
simple keystrokes. Or. you can 
plan for it as seldom as once every 
99 weeks or as often as daily. 

Want to go out to your favorite 
restaurant? Enter the restaurant's 
name as a "Main Course," Now 
your computer will automatically 
remind you to go out to eat— and 
as often as you select. It will de- 
lete all other items from that meal 
except the name of the restaurant. 

AUTOMATIC SHOPPING LIST 

You get a new menu each week 
or for just a few days if you want. 
And, it generates a detailed shop- 
ping list, automatically. It can 
arrange each item on the list in 
sequence according to the aisles 
at your favorite store. Studies 
showa shopping list will discour- 
age impulse buying and save 
you money. 

Also, it generates a per serving 
calorie counter. This is easy to 
delete anytime you are not in a 
diet mood or want to celebrate 
for any reason. You never count 
calories unless you want to. 

RANDOMLY DELICIOUS 

Say goodby to boring meals. 
Your computer will remember 
variety is the spice of life. This 
system makes eating at home a 
pleasure again. Each menu is 
randomly generated from major 
food groups according to the 
specific criteria you select. The 
system is easy to learn and easy 
to operate. Yet it is a sophisti- 
cated piece of software which will 
prevent menu mix-ups. 

It will add a new dimension to 
your home meals without increas- 
ing your food costs. It is rumored 
The Pizza Program may actually 
reduce the climbing divorce rate. 
Husbands now have something 
to look forward to for dinner 
Wives think it is terrific because 



it saves time and effort. And, kids 
love anything computerized. This 
is a useful and practical applica- 
tion you'll appreciate day after 
day, week after week. 

TRY IT FOR 30 DAYS , 
WITHOUT RISK 

This tested system is guaran- 
teed to make your life easier and 
happier Our home trial lets you 
actually use The Pizza Program 
for a full 30 days before you de- 
cide to keep it. Watch the fun and 
convenience it creates. Enjoy 
better meals and see how much 
time it saves. If you are not satis- 
fied for any reason, return it 
within 1 month for a prompt and 
courteous refund. Your invest- 
ment is just $34.50 plus $2.00 for 
shipping and handling. (Califor- 
nia residents add 6'/?% sales tax.) 
Full documentation is included. 

OUT OF THE RUT 

One housewife's reaction to 
this program is typical. She wrote, 
"Before using your system I found 
myself getting into a rut of serv- 
ing the same things over and over. 
The Pizza Program has changed 
all of this for me. We now have a 
wider variety of dinners and best 
of all I don't have to decide what 
they will be. If this was all it did, 
I'd be thrilled. But it isn't. The 
shopping list I receive along with 
my menus has been such a time 
saver I quickly run through it 
and delete anything I feel I don't 
need and add something I might. 
I would have a hard time going 
back to doing my menus by hand." 

This system requires an Apple II 
Plus* with 48K and 1 disk drive. 
We urge you to take advantage 
of our no-risk, 30 day home trial 
offer. To order call toll free and

RMS/175 Volts dc level. 2) High fre- 
quency noise is smoothed out be- 
fore reaching the Apple n. A PI type 
filter attenuates common mode 
noise signals by a minimum of 
30 dB from 600 khz to 20 mhz, with 
a maximum attenuation of 50 dB. 



For Cooling 

As soon as you move to 64K RAM 
or 80 columns on your Apple n you 
need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral 
cards generate more heat. In addi- 
tion, the cards block any natural air 
flow through the Apple II creating 
high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the 
cards and the computer itself. 



For Operating Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two 
sv^tched power outlets. As shown 
in the diagram, the SYSTEM 
SAVER efficiently organizes your 
system so that one convenient, 
front mounted 
power switch 
controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple H, 
monitor and printer. 



MONItOB 








APPLE II 




SYSTEM SAVER provides cor- 
rect cooling. An efficient, quiet fan 
draws fresh air across the mother 
board, over the power supply and 
out the side ventilation slots. 



The heavy duty switch has a 
pilot light to alert when system is 
on.You'll never use the Apple power 
switch again! 



Easy Installation 



Compatible with Apple Stand 



Just clips on. 
No mounting or 
hardware required.

Word processing 
so advanced 
anyone can use it. 




Format II was tested for six 
months in the demanding 
arena of WaU Street. Dis 
tributed by local deal- 
ers to law firms, finan- 
cial institutions, and 
the like. Format II was 
used by secretaries and 
non-technical personnel. Overwhelm- 
ingly Format E was recognized as one of the easi- 
est and most effective word processing systems 
available in anyfonn. 

Here's why Format II is unique among word 
processing programs: 

What you see is what you get. Format n 
performs virtually any editing and formatting func- 
tion you can imagine and displays on the screen 
the text exactly as it v\7ill print out — paragraphs, 
underlining, justification, page breaks. 
Simple to Use. You edit and format text with 
single key strokes. "D" for delete, "E" for edit, "I" for 
insert, "J" for justify etc. Easy-to-remember com- 
mands because they make sense. 



It supports all 
printers compat- 
ible with the Apple. 
Shadow printing, bold- 
facing, proportional 
spacing, sub- and super- 
scripting are all available. 
Includes a sophisticated 
Mailing List. Stores and re- 
trieves names and addresses 
which may be printed on labels or incorporated 
into documents. Powerful "logic" commands allow 
you to select only those records which match 
specified criteria. 

And more. Format II is lightning fast and 
menu driven. Add them aH together and it's clear 
why Format E has generated such enthusiasm. 
Now; at a cost of $250, you too can buy the best. 

Format E is available from most local dealers. 
E not, ask them to contact us, or order directly and 
receive a 30 day money-back guarantee.

Unless otherwise noted, all products can be assumed to run on either Apple 
II, with 48K, ROM Applesoft, and one disk drive. The requirement for 
ROM Applesoft can be met by RAM Applesoft in a language card. Many 
Apple II programs will run on the Apple III in the emulator mode. 

RAMdisk 320. By Harold M. Lee and Guil Banks. Way back when the 
Apple II first came out, a lot of people kept their initial cost down by us- 
ing a cassette recorder to store programs. The wait for any load or save 
procedure was annoyingly long; you could go out and make a sandwich 
while it loaded a large program. So those early Apple owners usually de- 
cided pretty quickly that the extra money for a disk drive would be 
well spent. 

With a disk, they reveled in their new speed of access, but, as they dis- 
covered more uses for their machines and started to take advantage of 
DOS's more sophisticated capabilities, they found once again that they 
spent too much time waiting. But what could they do? 

Well, the price of RAM went down, and people started putting out 
add-on memory cards for the Apple. This development led to the pseu- 
do-disk card with 128K or more, and from there to the RAMdisk 320. 

Axlon's RAMdisk 320 gives the Apple 320K of extra memory. Be- 
cause the 6502 can address only 64K, this much additional storage can't 
be used directly; it requires some sort of operating system. The RAM- 
disk's quite reasonable solution, one that not only provides the periph- 
eral with a ready-made set of sophisticated uses but also makes it in- 
stantly compatible with a huge body of extant software, was to use DOS. 

Actually, as DOS is designed to operate a physical read/ write device 
rather than a totally electronic one, Axlon added code to DOS so that it 
could handle both kinds of I/O. That won't make any difference to most 
end users because once the RAMdisk DOS System Master has been 
booted the software is there; you won't have to think about it anymore. 
The only limitation is that subsequently booting a disk with an unmodi- 
fied DOS wipes out the modified one. This makes the RAMdisk incom- 
patible with software that must be booted to be run. 

The RAMdisk itself is encased in a metal box the same size, shape, 
and color as a disk drive. The most obvious differences are the lack of a 
slot for the disk to go in and the addition of extra lights on the front. 
Two lights are in-use lights for the two pseudo-disks. They flicker on and 
off so fast for most loads that if you blink you might miss it. 

The other lights relate to the power supply. Because RAM is vola- 
tile, it has to have power at all times or the data is lost. The RAMdisk has 
its own power supply, which means it can keep programs in memory 
while the Apple is off It also has a three-hour rechargeable battery to 
guard against brownouts and blackouts. Recharging is no hassle; it takes 
place whenever the RAMdisk is on and plugged in. 

The RAMdisk's strongest asset is, of course, its greatly increased 
speed. Programs come as soon as you call them. Binary files containing 
hi-res screens are thirty-four sector monsters that are usually a bear to 
wait for. With the RAMdisk they appear in less than three seconds. A 
dealer demo based on Apple's old Magic Lantern slide show demon- 
strates how, with special fast loading techniques, hi-res pictures can come 
up at the incredible rate of three per second. 

For anyone who spends too much time listening to the old Disk lis 
whirring and clicking, this device is an amazing asset. In DOS 3.3, Pas- 
cal, and CP/M environments, it allows you to save often without spend- 
ing a lot of time doing it. For a price slightly more than that of two disk 
drives, you can have two disks full of frequently used programs at your 
fingertips— /flj;. DD

Spitfire Simulator. By Ted Kurtz. Your airplane is a Supermarine 
Spitfire Mkl, sporting a 1,030 horsepower Rolls-Royce Merlin II engine 
and boasting maximum level flight speed of 360 miles per hour. Sound 
familiar? Probably not, if you've only used other flight simulators. 

Although it's similar in many respects to AirSim-1, Spitfire Simu- 
lator takes you into a whole new world. Your options include simply fly- 
ing around over a grid map and learning to land, attempting aerobatic 
maneuvers, or pursuing any of eight different types of target aircraft glor- 
iously displayed in three dimensions. 

Spitfire Simulator includes lots of options to make your flying more 
enjoyable. You can move your Spitfire around by using the control-T 
command, which magically places your plane at the coordinates you 
select. This can be extremely handy for locating the elusive nonfiring tar- 
get aircraft you will no doubt be chasing. Despite the chase and shoot 
sequence. Spitfire Simulator is not a war game. The target chase option is 
provided mainly to test your flying ability. You'll be handsomely re- 
warded if you can destroy a target, return to the aerodrome, and 
land safely. 

Next on the list of nifty options is the ability to alter the sensitivity of 
the ailerons and elevators with the touch of a key. This is a valuable 
asset when you need to make drastic changes in altitude or to break 
quickly out of a turn. 

On the subject of turns, the wings can be leveled with a single key 
press. This makes it much easier to hne up with the runway for landings 
and also to chase target planes. Of course. Mind Systems didn't forget 
the all-important pause command, which is so essential to the average 
micro-pilot. 

All told, if you don't own a flight simulator but the idea intrigues 
you, put this on the top of your list. For those who're already flying aces, 
Spitfire Simulator's super features offer a new challenge. And, if you 
happen to own AirSim-I already. Spitfire can read the scenery data on 
the AirSim-1 disk. Whether you're a serious flyer or it's all in fun. Spit- 
fire covers the bases. DAD

Frogger. By Olaf Lubeck. Who are they trying to kid? This may be the 
official version of the popular arcade game Frogger, but it has about as 
much soul as month-old lettuce in the Sahara. 

That may sound a tad angry, but in perspective it should be quite 
understandable. This program has been ballyhooed since mid or early 
summer, and it marks a strange departure from (then) On-Line's policy 
of thumbing its corporate nose at Atari and its ilk by putting out tongue- 
in-cheek copies of popular arcade games. Some pretty wonderful games 
came out of that stage of On-Line's trek to big business stardom; Jaw- 
breaker, Pegasus II, and Cannonball Blitz come to mind imme- 
diately. These games were marked by state-of-the-art graphics and a 
good deal of irreverence and style. 

Frogger sounds the death knell for that touch. The graphics border 
on being abysmal. Wit has been traded for irony. After forcing another 
company's clone off the market and belitfling that particular version 
(named after a frog's distinctive vocal signature), On-Line has put out a 
game that is graphically no better than the subject of its ridicule. 

Make no mistake about it, Frogger is a good game. It was pop- 
ular in the arcades and it's destined to be popular in the home. It's quite 
addictive. You are a frog, trying to get home. Between you and your 
hangouts are roads swarming with relentless vehicles and a fast-flowing 
river with turtles, logs, alligators, and sea monsters. You must dodge the 
traffic and then hop onto the backs of turtles that submerge from time to 
time, onto the logs that zip by, and ultimately onto the far shore and

home. One misstep and it's bye-bye tadpole. Bonus points are accumu- 
lated by eating the occasional insect that pops up in your home or by 
hopping onto a lady frog who passes by on a log and escorting her home. 
As one progresses to higher levels in the game, the traffic becomes 
heavier and faster, and more and more hazards crop up. Even the median 
strip between the highway and the river, at first a resting place, begins to 
be patrolled by a snake (nearly invisible in this version) who is loathe to 
pass up a tasty frog. 

The game is elegant in its simplicity. You move up, down, left, or 
right. You make it across or you get mashed, eaten, drowned, or what- 
ever. It takes perhaps five seconds to learn how to play, yet it's madden- 
ingly habit-forming. 

But that is the game Frogger, not the official version from the folks in 
Coarsegold. The difference is the graphics. In the Apple version, your 
frog resembles a chess pawn with vestigial wings. The logs in the river 
look like they just escaped from the Oscar Mayer factory. When your 
"frog" hops on a "log," it appears to have stuck its webbed foot into an 
electric socket; it positively vibrates. 

Despite the lackluster graphics, this game is fun to play. But for 
Apple owners it constitutes a slap in the face. Sierra On-Lihe's Atari ver- 
sion of the same game is great. The graphics sparkle, the sound is 
wonderful, and the game is certainly in the forefront of that particular 
market. Why did they release such a mediocre implementation for the 
market that put On -Line where it is now? 

In what is probably another unintended irony, Frogger is doubly 
entertaining. Aside from playing the game, it allows Apple folks to 
speculate endlessly on what goes on in Coarsegold. Have we been for- 
saken? Was On-Line feeling bad about the seemingly interminable delays 
and just eager to get a product to market, before it was ready? Had they 
all just been watching a 3-D movie and forgotten to remove their plastic 
glasses? What happened? 

We choose to look at this offering as an aberration. We believe On- 
Line is a solid company with its consumers' interests at heart. Its people 
have consistently put out good games and in many ways have set stan- 
dards in the Apple field. They have exhibited class and humor in many of 
their endeavors and have been a bastion of quality in a sea of medioc- 
rity. Either Frogger is a mistake, or it's a betrayal. We prefer to believe 
the former. You'll have to make up your own minds. DA

Hello Central! By Bruce Kallick. The most satisfying feature of Hello 
Central! is its user friendliness. Though it doesn't offer much more than 
other communications programs on the market, it is easier to use. 

Hello Central! bypasses any confusing control or escape codes by 
guiding you through the program via menus. Menu commands are 
executed either by inputting the number of the desired command or by 
use of an arrow-controlled cursor. 

The most frequently used function, downloading the buffer, offers 
some features that have been longed for in a terminal program. The first 
of these is the option for lower-case display. When you first use Hello 
Central! you'll need to configure the program to your hardware. If you 
have a lower-case adapter, fine; the option to display upper-case letters in 
inverse provides for easier reading and editing on upper-case-only 
Apples. 

Incoming text can also be displayed in a way that avoids having to 
split words on your screen. An extra carriage return is inserted (but not 
stored in the buffer) when a line reaches the end of the screen and it's in 
the middle of a word. 

The download mode also has an error-detection function that lets you 
know visually if an error has occurred during transmission. If an error 
such as noise interference occurs, you'll see an exclamation point and a 
line feed after the character in doubt. 

The buffer itself is large enough to capture and hold text files of a rea- 
sonable size (seventy-one sectors) and will automatically save to disk 
while putting the sending source "on hold." 

Uploading files to the modem has several options as well, allowing 
you to send entire files at a time (with an option to wait for a prompt) or 
one line at a time. This comes in handy when trying to reduce on-line 
time with bulletin boards and other message-related sources. 



Need an answering service? With a Basic command or two, the pro- 
gram will display a message to whoever calls up on modem, and it will let 
them leave a message for you. As many different messages can be dis- 
played and recorded as you can store on a disk. 

Hello Central! includes a utility for receiving Basic or machine lan- 
guage programs in a text file. The text version can be transmitted and 
then executed to re-create the original program. The reverse process is 
possible, naturally. All you need in order to create a text file from the 
original program are the starting and ending Hne numbers (for Basic) or 
the beginning and ending addresses (for machine language). 

All functions related to receiving and sending data are easy to use 
even if you've never opened the manual. However, this isn't true when 
you're trying to use the editor. The editor will let you trim down what's in 
the buffer and keep what you want, provided you can figure out how to 
use it. Searching for strings' occurrences, inserting and deleting text, and 
moving around from place to place in the editor are awkward, and you'd 
be better off organizing things using a word processor you're familiar 
with that stores files as Apple text files. 

One aspect of Hello Central! that deserves mention is the manual. It's 
short, to the point, and easy to understand. If you're having trouble with 
anything in the program, finding the right place in the manual for help is 
a snap. 

Hello Central! is a great terminal program for routine sending and re- 
ceiving of files and is completely modifiable. If you're tired of poring 
through reams of printed documentation just to perform a few simple ac- 
tivities, consider this one.

How To Operate the Apple II Plus. By Howard Manthei and Lee 
McFadden. Okay, the age of the printed word has passed. You've got 
your Apple and you just want to set it up and make it go, and you're not 
going to read the manual — not really. But you can at least listen to it. 

Assuming absolutely no knowledge of the Apple (or of anything else 
vaguely resembling a computer). How To Operate the Apple // Plus is a 
set of three audio cassette tapes containing about five hours of instruc- 
tion on loading, running, saving, copying, protecting, modifying, cal- 
culating, and virtually any other nonprogramming function that can be 
performed on an Apple. 

This is, of course, invaluable as an educational tool and is designed in 
a manner that makes it ideal for use in schools. There is a quiz at the end 
of each lesson, and the operator's guide consists of a summary of key 
ideas for the course. The spoken instruction is painstakingly detailed, 
telling you what it's going to tell you, telling you, and then telling you 
that it told you; a preliterate child who used this program could master 
the computer before having mastered Dick and Jane. 

These are FlipTrack training tapes, so named for their niftiest feature: 
in-depth instruction on several of the subjects covered is available by flip- 
ping over the tape, setting the tape counter to zero, and playing the op- 
tional tutorial. Stopping, flipping the tape again, and rewinding to zero 
puts you back in the main lesson. This feature is also used for alternate 
instruction in the operation of a printer and the use of a color monitor, 
game paddles, and a second disk drive. 

As the responsibility for computer literacy looms larger over the na- 
tion's educational establishment, a couple dozen of these programs in a 
city school system would free teachers from the necessity of taking a 
night school crash course to learn something about the subject they 
should be teaching. Teachers could learn right along with their students. 
There is also the obvious application in computer-wary businesses that 
are looking for a fast, sure way of familiarizing their employees with the 
strange new machines on their desk tops. 

As the operator's guide points out, this is more conversational than a 
manual or printed tutorial, and it leaves your eyes and concentration free 
for the screen and the keyboard. Unlike a disk tutorial, it leaves your 
computer free to try out what you are learning when you learn it. And 
unlike a live tutor, it lets you learn what you want, when you want to, 
and won't rap your knuckles when you get it wrong. 

And the ad copy writers are right. This product is exactly what they 
say it is: a superior way to learn about an Apple. A(

Free Fall. By Mark Turmell. Have you ever had one of those dreams 
where you're floating through the air, slowly, gently, as if you could flout 
the law of gravity? Free Fall is like that. 

The game resembles Frogger in a way. Your character must fall from 
the top of the screen down through a variety of objects and escape 
through one of the four holes at the bottom. When your character es- 
capes through a hole, the hole gets filled in. When all four holes have 
been filled in, the screen changes. Should a hole be orange when you go 
through it, you'll earn an extra man. 

Your main nemesis in the game is a needle that pierces up from the 
bottom of the screen. Should it impale your falling body, the dream dis- 
solves, as does your falling bod. 

As you fall, you can change your direction by using game paddle or 
joystick. And if you can get both of your hands over a horizontally 
traveling girder you can grab hold of it and it will transport you in the 
direction it is going. 

Should you leave the left side of the screen, you lose one of your three 
men; depart on the right, and you're elevated back up to the top again. 

In the first screen, girders transport not only you, but also prizes and 
bombs. If your dangling feet strike a prize, you win extra points. The 
bombs won't hurt you unless they explode. To put the boom back in the 
bombs, there's a freely bouncing ball. When that hits a bomb — take 
cover. 

It takes a bit of dexterity to wiggle your character through the holes 
in the floor. At times, it's impossible to make it and you lose your char- 
acter. At other times, you can't miss. 

The second screen features Bip-Bops and needles. The Bip-Bops 
don't explode, but the bouncing ball does when it touches anything other 
than the girders. The ball, needles, and explosion debris can hurt you in 
this screen. The girders bounce off the edges of the screen. 

Screen three — Gunners — is much like the first screen with the addi- 
tion of two large guns. The guns move independently up and down the 
left side of the screen, firing only when their paths cross. If you're hang- 
ing from a girder when a gun fires, you're safe from the projectile. 

Negotiate passage through all three of the screens and you'll start 
over again at a more difficult level. There are three levels of difficulty for 
each screen. DA

ASCII Express: The Professional. By Mark Robbins and Bill Blue. 
ASCII Express Pro offers features galore for everyone from the beginner 
to the most experienced modem user. Its only weakness is its documen- 
tation. 

First the good points: ^£ Pro is compatible with all printer inter- 
faces, eighty-column boards, external terminals, and the forty-column 
screen. 

Speed flexibility is a strong feature. AE Pro supports all serial inter- 
faces at all baud rates up to 9,6(X) baud, provided that your modem inter- 
face and your screen display can handle such high speeds. At the slower 
end, the program supports the deaf TTY standard (Baudot), 45.5 baud 
when it's interfaced with the Novation Apple Cat modem. 

It can perform terminal emulation with eighty-column cards, has an 
extensive macro capability, and holds a catalog of up to twenty-six com- 
puter telephone numbers and the associated data necessary to sign on 
those hosts. 

Add to all this its own text editor, memory manager (for RAM 
cards), and autosave to disk with numbered extensions. If, for example, 
you begin saving under File, subsequent saves go automatically to disk 
under the names File2, FileS, and so on. 

AE Pro can send files a block, a line, or a character at a time and has 
the Christensen error-checking protocol. As a result, you can transfer 
any size or type of file to another AE Pro. 

You can also use the remote option to operate the machine while 
you're at a distant location. Finally, there is a remote answer-back func- 
tion for electronic mail. 

If all you ever plan to use this program for is to check into a local 



3(X)-baud community bulletin board, it is probably more than you need. 
However, if you check into several bulletin boards every day, you could 
use AE Pro to create a range of macros that would dial the number, then 
sign you onto different portions. You could even have conditional ma- 
cros: if there's electronic mail waiting, AE Pro would get it; otherwise it 
might check the bulletins. 

Perhaps you always check Dow Jones for a particular stock you're 
interested in. You could set up a disk (the program is copiable) specifical- 
ly for that. AE Pro could then act as a turnkey program, dialing the num- 
ber and signing you on automatically, then searching for your subject 
whenever you boot that particular disk. 

Once you're on-line, you can jump in and out of AE Pro. Let's as- 
sume, for example, that there's a long message for you on a BBS. Simply 
hit control-Q, which propels you into AE Pro. From there select R, 
which turns the copy buffer on, and you're back on-line. Call the mes- 
sage back up, and AE Pro will store it in memory in the buffer for you to 
save to disk or print out later. 

You might want to edit the message you received. Use the editor for 
this purpose. Or use it to compose a message to leave on several BBSs 
around town. 

So the good news about AE Pro is its many capabilities. The bad 
news is that the documentation doesn't make it easy for you to take ad- 
vantage of them. And there's no index, although SDS reports that Bill 
Blue is working on one. 

It gets awfully frustrating when you're trying to find something you 
know the program is capable of doing but you don't know where to be- 
gin to look. Most business users, who would find this program inval- 
uable, would have to spend precious time uncovering the information 
they need. (Hobbyists who are enamored of working with software prob- 
ably wouldn't suffer as much.) 

There should be a prompt card explaining what the various com- 
mands do. A page in the manual showing what the original noncon- 
figured program looks like would also be helpful — it's easy to hit a key 
accidentally and unwittingly change some aspect of the configuration.

AE Pro has two main menus, plus four secondary configuration 
menus that can be adjusted to your specific machine. And that doesn't 
count the menu to change the macros or the one for the text editor. 

Make a copy of the program immediately and keep the original un- 
sullied. Then if you need to verify that there's a difference between the 
copy you use and the original, you'll be able to. 

Taken all in all, AE Pro is a diamond in the rough. It holds tremen- 
dous promise but needs a fair amount of polishing. 

The publisher, of course, supports all its programs, and a telephone 
call to them will often serve to clarify an obscure point. DA

Fred III. By Robert Pritchett. Here is a clever menu-driven home budget 
program to fulfill the needs of those of us who want to maintain a budget 
without having to spend an inordinate amount of time and effort learn- 
ing to use a program. 

Fred is an extremely user-friendly program that allows you to set up 
to thirty budget categories and twelve savings or investment accounts per 
data disk. The entire program is stored in RAM, and any entries you 
make are not updated on the data disk until you actually exit the pro- 
gram. This feature greatly speeds up the entire operation since you don't 
have to wait for each submenu to load before entering data. Another 
advantage of this feature is that you can play with what-if type projec- 
tions and see what your financial status might be without having to save 
all the data to disk. 

Fred allows the user to see what bills are due, the total amount still 
owed, the current monthly payment due, and the date that the payment 
is due. You can also see when the last payment was made. Fred does not 
allow you to maintain an audit trail of entries made prior to your last 
entry. Fred is primarily set up to enable you to keep cumulative totals of 
your income and expenses. If you want to track specific checks and/or 
expenditures, another program such as Continental's Home Accountant 
would be better suited to your needs. 

Fred has several useful features, one of which is the ability to calcu- 
late simple interest on savings and other investments. Interest can be 



computed by number of years, number of months, number of days, or 
number of quarters. 

Another feature is the cash-metering option. FrediaV.es the amount 
of money you enter, computes the number of days left in the current 
month (from the system date you enter when you first boot the pro- 
gram), and divides that sum by the number of days remaining in the 
month to show you how much you can spend each day and still stay 
within your budget. 

The only glaring omission in Fred is that no provision is made to 
allow a hard copy printout of your budget. All in all, Fred is a good 
money management program that could be ideally suited to the needs of 
small clubs, organizations, or small businesses that need a tool for track- 
ing accounts payable and cash on hand. nn

Space Cadette. By Dan Illowsky. For those arcade enthusiasts who find 
Crossfire and Labyrinth insufficiently challenging, Funtastic offers its 
first entry into the Apple arcade. 

Space Cadette starts with eleven shifK and twenty-four torpedoes that 
replenish rapidly throughout the game; bonus ships are earned for every 
one hundred points. Modifiable keyboard controls allow saving to 
disk — a feature that does help take the sting out of the fact that there is 
no joystick control — good news for all those Apple gameplayers who still 
don't own one. 

Space Cadette is a simulator game designed to test the "identifica- 
tion of strengths and weaknesses of hostile alien ships during an attack, 
construction and maintenance of force shields during an attack, and 
quick reactions and endurance under actual battle conditions." This 
means that, as a cadette in a battle simulator, the player must fly his ship 
around a blocklike maze pursuing, or being pursued by, enemy ships. 
Like the old game of boxes, as the cadette ship passes the blocks, it leaves 
behind force fields in its path. The shields do not slow down enemy ships, 
as one might expect, but intercept the enemy torpedoes. The enemy ships 
take great pleasure in blowing the pogees out of player shields and re- 
placing them with their own. Deploying the player's shields while de-

stroying the enemy's allows for a bit of strategy and lots of fireworks, es- 
pecially in the higher levels. 

As the game progresses, characteristics of the different types of ene- 
my ships will soon force even an experienced arcade player to adopt dif- 
ferent strategies for handling them. The reflector ships may only be hit 
on the sides that do not have the reflectors; otherwise, a cadette will fall 
victim to his own fire. Kamikazes are fast and will ram a retreating ca- 
dette before he can escape. The Berzerker ships . . . well, sooner or later 
all good cadettes must see what they are made of. 

At any time during the game, players have the option of selecting 
new skill levels; they may earn the next higher level with their scores. It 
takes at least three hundred points to advance to the next level. Be 
warned: in the upper levels, the sound of enemy fire most resembles a gei- 
ger counter atop a load of plutonium. The blockhke maze never changes, 
but the graphics are smooth, flickerfree, and fast. Enemy ships, cadette 
ships, and explosions are top quality, recognizable even in black 
and white. 

Space Cadette also features a somewhat unique and definitely inti- 
mate (keyboard) two-player mode, which requires an entirely different 
strategy. Using a color monitor does lessen the confusion that exists in 
this "free-for-all" mode. It's a nice way to lose friends and influence 
aliens. 

A less polished version of this game was released through Data- 
Most, but author Dan Illowsky recalled, revised, and reissued Space Ca- 
dette as the premier release of his own software company. HAS

Inventory Manager. By Joe Marinello. If you've ever struggled with a 
database program trying to get your retail inventory up to snuff, then 
you'll certainly appreciate Synergistic Software's newest offering. Retail- 
ers and distributors take note: this program alone may well justify the 
purchase of an Apple, and it may make your life just that much easier. 

Inventory Manager comes equipped to handle your inventory of up to 
2,7(X) items (1,200 for single disk drive owners). It keeps records of your 



current level of inventory and the sale price, wholesale price, vendor, 
stock on order, reorder point, and markup for each inventory item. The 
program can print a list of suggested orders for all items whose quantity 
in stock has fallen below the reorder point. It will also print a list of all 
your inventory items and their prices, quantity in stock and on order, 
your markup percentage, and the vendors who supply the products 
to you. 

Inventory Manager remembers and will print a list of all items cur- 
rently on order. You can even tabulate and print a list of the total 
amount of orders over any time period you choose (monthly, quarterly, 
annually, or whatever). It can store and print a list of all vendors who 
supply your stock, up to a maximum of ninety-nine, including names 
and addresses. 

Other options include printing a list of your inventory and orders sort- 
ed by vendor; printing purchase orders, sorted by vendor, each with a 
unique purchase order number; and printing a data worksheet to aid in 
record keeping and assist you in entering new information. 

The program will also print a list of sold stock, sorted by the gross 
profit realized on your sales for each item of inventory, making it a val- 
uable management tool. And a list detailing the percent of gross profit 
provided by each of thirteen inventory categories defined by you can also 
be printed. 

Included within Inventory Manager is a utility program called 
IM-Retail. This is basically a scaled-down version of the Inventory Man- 
ager program. Your employees can use it to enter data for your pro- 
gram's use. Users are allowed to access only three of the main routines: 
Update Inventory and Sold List, List Vendor Codes, and Category 
Search. Sensitive pricing information is inaccessible from this program, 
so you're protected from unwanted disclosure. 

Inventory Manager is among the most complete programs of its type 
on the market today. Marinello seems to have left no stone unturned. If 
you do business with vendors or in retail marketing, you cannot afford to 
miss out on this one. - DAD

Anova II. By Stephen Madigan, Ph.D., and Virginia Lawrence, Hi.D. 
Anova // is a general variance analysis program for the Apple II. If you 
don't know what analysis of variance (ANOVA) is, you probably won't 
purchase this program. It is most useful to students, both undergraduate 
and graduate, enrolled in statistics or research courses that involve the 
comparison of differences between groups on a number of independent 
dimensions. 

The program allows for the creation of data files or direct keyboard 
input of data. Three major classes of analysis of variance are possible: 
factorial designs, split-plot (between-within) types, and randomized block 
(repeated measures) designs. While not as general a program as SAS's 
PROC GLM or SPSS's Manova, Anova II nonetheless covers a wide 
range of designs. It would be nice to see a future version that would al- 
low nested factors and specification of random effects variables, but for 
the moment Anova II is the most powerful analysis of variance package 
available on a personal computer. 

The program uses an unweighted means algorithm for missing data. 
This is an extremely important feature since data without missing values 
is nearly impossible to come by these days. A nova II also allows the in- 
clusion of covariants, provides descriptive statistics, and includes an ex- 
cellent graphical display package. 

Testing the program with a number of example problems proved it to 
be computationally correct. Being menu driven, it is relatively easy to use 
for a program of this level of sophistication. The time between entry of 
data for an unbalanced split-plot factorial design and the output of a so- 
lution is less than with a time-shared IBM 3033. 

.The manual is adequate for those users well versed in analysis of var- 
iance. Others are going to have to work hard to understand how to use 
the program. Repeat, the ease of use of this program will be directly pro- 
portional to the user's knowledge of variance analysis. 

The use of Anova II by working researchers is not recommended be- 
cause of the structure of the data files. It is common for research data 
files to contain the data for all subjects (cases) on all variables; thus a file 
for a research project that has two hundred subjects and fifty variables

would contain ten thousand separate values. Anova II would break up 
the data file into at least fifty files, depending on the method of data stor- 
age selected. Further, each file might contain a different number of 
values, due to missing cases, and could require a different set of param- 
eters to be input into the program. This is unacceptable to the working 
researcher. 

However, Anova II is an excellent tool for the investigation of analy- 
sis of variance by students in the social, biological, and health sciences. 
Anova II would allow the student to work on problems at home that 
could take hours to compute using an electronic calculator. PE

InvisiCalc. By Isaac C. Nahtink. Could you use an electronic spread- 
sheet program with unlimited parameters? One that anticipates your 
needs and acts to meet them? One that is actually faster and easier to use 
than VisiCalcl Well, wait no longer, because the folks at Slipshod Soft- 
ware (Bad Nation, SD) have done it again with InvisiCalc. 

Don't be surprised when you boot InvisiCalc and are greeted with a 
blank screen. This versatile accounting package was written in Slander 
(Spreadsheet Language Algorithm for Non-Displayable Electronic 
Readout), which automatically bombs the Monitor and resets lomem to 
take over all areas of graphics and text storage, freeing up a full seventy- 
two pages (18K) of memory. And that's not all. 

Pioneering new frontiers in system transportability, Slipshod's Uriah 
Stukk developed the Kick -Ass Operating System for InvisiCalc when he 
discovered he couldn't get DOS to download to the cpu in his micro- 
wave oven. The display routines in KAOS were designed for the Aman- 
da SonaRange's three-digit LED readout. Stukk couldn't figure out how 
to transport them back up to the more complicated Apple, so he threw 
them out. This led somewhat circuitously to the development of Slander. 
These guys don't believe in doing things halfway. 



By the ehmination of all output routines, additional memory is made 
available on zero page and in the upper reaches of ROM, which is some- 
how overwritten by KAOS. 

Slipshod president George Spelvin asked Nahtink to write InvisiCalc 
for two reasons: to display (well, not literally) what he felt was the enor- 
mous potential of KAOS and Slander and to interface with Cropduster 
(reviewed in the February 1982 Softalk) in place of VisiCalc, which was 
drawing a certain amount of unwanted legal attention from VisiCorp. 
Spelvin had just emerged from hiding after successfully avoiding a pre- 
vious suit for the six month period of Bad Nation's statute of limitations 
(recently enacted by Bad Nation's new mayor, Peter Spelvin, no rela- 
tion). Having discovered that vigorously denying one's existence is bad 
for business, Spelvin didn't want to start the whole process over again. 

Nahtink is a died-in-the-wool proponent of the "That's not a bug, it's 
a feature; did we charge you for the deluxe version?" school of computer 
programming, and it shows in the quality of his work. InvisiCalc has (or 
claims to have, but who's to know?) features that Frankston and Brick- 
lin never even conceived of 

First of all, the spreadsheet is n-dimensional, which implies a set of 
parameters for each answer cell that you'll be glad aren't displayed. Sec- 
ond, the Y axis can be toggled between the left and right sides of the 
spreadsheet, making InvisiCalc more comfortable to left-handers and 
readers of Hebrew. This feature is only available in two-dimensional 
mode. Attempting to invoke it otherwise will result in all the data in 
memory undergoing an exclusive-or operation with the EBCDIC values 
of the letters of Nahtink's name. This seems to be part of Slipshod's 
unique software protection scheme. 

Perhaps the most impressive feature of the program is the unlimited 
memory, which Spelvin admits is jury-rigged. As the user moves the cur- 
sor into previously unused areas, KAOS initializes new sections of 
memory. When it runs out of RAM, it moves previous sections of the 
spreadsheet to the disk. When it runs out of disk space, it overwrites

earlier material under the assumption that if the user really needed it he 
wouldn't have moved the cursor so far away. Caution is advised. 

Overall, this is a revolutionary accounting tool. Whether the advan- 
tages outweigh the disadvantages is a matter for the user to decide. For 
instance, it is great for keeping a second set of books for tax evasion pur- 
poses, even though it seems to subtract a random amount from negative 
nonintegers. The South Dakota Bell System, of which Spelvin is still 
chairman of the board, reports the satisfactory use of InvisiCalc by its 
customer service department to explain billing discrepancies.

Computer Acquire. By Steve Goss. Acquire, one of Avalon Hill's top 
selling bookshelf games, is a natural choice to bring to the microcom- 
puter. It is a nongraphic game of hotel empire building, with some of the 
elements of bingo. Up to six people can play on any one of five levels of 
difficulty, or you can play solo against the computer. You can bone up 
by having the computer play against itself and studying the various strat- 
egies as they unfold. 

Each player is given six thousand dollars and six randomly selected 
hotel tiles. In turn, players place tiles on the alphanumeric grid board. If 
you join two or more tiles together, you form a hotel chain, for which 
you must choose one of seven names; the names incorporate the class of 
your hotels. As founder of a chain, you receive a bonus share of its stock. 
Each turn, all players may buy stock in their own or other chains. 

More tiles placed adjacent to a chain increase the chain and the val- 
ue of its stock rises sharply. If you can place a tile so that it joins two or 
more chains, then the smaller chains are merged into the bigger chain 
and stock is exchanged, two shares of the old for one of the new. Only 
when a chain has at least eleven hotels in it is it deemed a "safe chain," 
which cannot be taken over. The game ends either when all the chains on 
the board are safe or when one chain has more than forty hotels in it. 



The winner is the player who has amassed the greatest fortune.

Sorcerer of Siva. By Gene Rice. Epyx has added a pure magic user's 
game to their fantasy role-playing line-up. In Sorcerer of Siva, you are a 
wizard with a whole range of different level magic spells. Fantastic 
graphics show fireballs and lightning bolts as they are hurled from your 
fingertips at salivating monsters. This scenario transports you into 
the Mines of Siva — a five-level dungeon. Your goal is to slay the evil Sor- 
cerer, snatch up as much treasure as possible, and escape from the mmes 
before sunset. Nineteen different types of monsters try to prevent you 
from leaving alive, and some of the treasures are cursed. 

The time factor in this game becomes the overriding consideration in 
playing; rarely will an adventurer be able to exit the mines successfully 
within the allotted time frame. Sorcerer of Siva has eight degrees of diffi- 
culty and monster speeds of one through ten. At the highest settings for 
both, the game shifts into intense arcade action, where reflexes are 
everything. 

Your wizard has seven major spells and two minor spells available at 
the beginning of the game. The evil Sorcerer will not attack you directly, 
but he will appear randomly (usually when you are busy fighting one of 
his minions) and zap you with a forget spell. A forget spell means you 
can no longer use that major spell unless you can find one of the magic 
touchstones, which are very rare. Another interesting feature, besides the 
normal problem of fatigue, is the introduction of energy levels. Not only 
do you have to have the knowledge to cast a major spell, but you must 
also have sufficient mystical energy. The current levd of your aura is in- 
dicated by colors — from blue down to black. 

With more than three hundred rooms on five levels, this game will be 
a challenge for any adventure-loving player, and a real delight for magic 
users. RRA

Time is money. You have a computer 
system because you know that it saves 
you money by simplifying procedures and 
reducing time normally involved in your 
work. Time is an important resource which 
should not be wasted. You are wasting ., 
valuable time'if you ever wait for your ■•- 
printer 

No waiting. Now with Microfazer by 
Quadram there is no more waiting. 

Microfazers are inexpensive universal 
printer buffers which any computer user 
cannot afford to be without. Any 
computer— any printer (or plotter!), 
whether parallel or serial. Microfazer 
receives information from the computer at 
ultra high speeds causing the computer to 
think the printer is printing just as fast as 
the computer can send. Microfazer holds 
the information until your printer can 
handle it, and then sends it on. 



More copies. Microfazer is equipped 
with a copy feature allowing additional 
copies of the buffered information— from 
one to as many as you want— with the 
mere press of a button. When you need 
your information repeated, for whatever 
reason, it's always right there— inside 
Microfazer. , ^ 

Microfazer™ stack. Microfazer can be 
stacked with popular modems or other 
peripherals. Some models can plug directly 
onto the back of your printer Install it in 
less than 60 seconds, and choose the 
amount of buffer memory you need— 8K, 
16K, 32K, or 64K. One model even comes 
with up to 512 K! You may use several 
Microfazers in series to create just what's 
right for you. Take data in from a serial 
computer and out to a parallel printer Or 



in from a parallel computer and out to a 
serial printer Microfazer is just as flexible 
as you need it to be. 

Low price. Only $169 for 8K of 
buffering, $189 (16K), $225 (32K) and • 
$299 for a full 64K. Serial-to-Parallel, 
Parallel-to-Serial and Serial-to-Serial 
models have slightly higher prices.

Undoubtedly the most requested DOStalk article or series of articles 
would be on the topic of copy protecting software for marketing and un- 
protecting purchased Apple disks for back-up purposes or whatever. 
Well, sorry, gang, nothing doing. The main reason is that you could fit 
everything I know about copy protection on a write-protect tab. The 
next reason is that anything learned about disk protection today is sub- 
ject to becoming obsolete next Tuesday. This is truly a fascinating sub- 
ject for some; others just can't get into it. 

A Catalog Columnizer. Let's continue our series of catalog utilities 
with a little program that fits an entire catalog on the text screen at one 
time. This program by itself isn't a real earth shaker, but with just a httle 
additional work, it could become a nifty greeting program for one-key 
program selection. 

Apple's DOS fortunately lets catalog names be a generous thirty 
characters long. You might not fully appreciate this until you seeCP/M 
work for the first time with its measly eight-plus-three-character file 
name limit and crowded catalog. Unfortunately, Apple's forty column 
screen prevents more than one file name per line, so a catalog often oc- 
cupies several screens full of file names. 

To fit more file names on the screen, we need to come up with a mul- 
tiple column catalog that abbreviates file names that are too long. The 
more columns we need, the shorter the file names. It will also be helpful, 
spacewise, to eliminate the three-digit file-size code and all spaces to the 
left of each file name. Total space used on the disk is more important 
than individual file sizes, so we'll include that feature instead. 

Here is the program; the explanations come later. No writing is done 
to the disk, so you can have (almost) no fear of ruining a disk. Still, it is 
best to run the program with an expandable disk the first couple of times.

Line 1 10 pokes our now famous jump to DOS's Read-W rite-Track- 
Sector routine into location 768 (hex 300). See October's DOStalk for 
more details. 

Line 120 selects the catalog track (TRK) 17 and tells DOS to read 
from (RW= 1), not write to (RW=2), the disk. These values are poked 
into appropriate locations in DOS's I/O Control Block, along with a 
couple of zeros to accept any disk volume and read an entire sector. 

Line 130 arbitrarily selects location 8192 (hex 2000) as our disk data 
temporary storage area, dissects that number (LOC) into two bytes, and 
pokes it into locations 47088 and 47089. 

Line 1 50 counts the number of active files on the disk by first read- 
ing the entire catalog, from sector (SE) 15 down as far as necessary. If the 
first byte (P) of each file record is not 255 (deleted) and not zero (un- 
used), then the number of files (NF) is increased by one. While we're 
there, we might as well count the number of sectors used (variable 
USED) by adding the value of byte 34 to byte 35 times 256. 

Line 160 tells our sector-reading routine to continue as long as we 
haven't encountered a value of zero for the first byte of any file. 

Line 170 uses string array T$(64) to convert DOS's numerical file- 
type codes (byte 3 of each file) into alphabetical characters for screen dis- 
play. We're all familiar with "BAIT" by now (Binary, Applesoft, In- 
teger, Text). The "BARS" file codes are rarely, if ever, seen. The alter- 
nate "B" and "A" file-type codes may never have even been used. 

Lines 180 through 210 determine the allowable length, L, of our file 
names according to the number of active files, NF, in the catalog. 

Line 220 sets variable COL to determine where to place vertical di- 
viders between catalog columns.

A PRACTICAL 
& EASY METHOD 
FOR LEARNING 
(OR DRUSHING-UP ON) 
SPANISH USED DY TRAVELERS. 

ADVENTURE, FUN, EDUCATION, and history ore oil 
reasons people travel to other countries. The problem 
is, when troveling to countries where little or no English 
is spoken, how to communicate. By spending a few 
hours with Spanish for the Traveler, you can gain o 
iDosic understanding of Spanish and at the some time 
provide yourself with a AAAGIC KEY which will open 
doo5 to the local culture not normally available to the 
overoge traveler. In o Lorin country,Qnyone who tries 
to speoK the Longuoge is almost always treoted with 
Q smile ond warmth by the people of that country. The 
way to gain this edge is to practice Spanish with 
Spanish for the Troveier before your trip. . . 

Because: 

• Ir'so quick and easy way to learn Spanish useful 
in traveling. 

• It's an opportunity to leorn some of the basics of 
Spanish without the necessity of attending dosses, 
lectures or listening to endless records. 

• It's presented In a monner which cotches your 
interest immediately ond encouroges you to 
continue building your Spanish vocabulary. 

• It provides you with the essentiols of Spanish 
necessary to moke your trip os enjoyable as

O. OOX 582-S • SANTEE, CALIFORNIA 92071 • 61 9/562-322 



Lines 230 and 240 draw inverse borders and a title. 

Line 250 again reads the catalog, putting each sector's data tempo- 
rarily into locations LOC through LOC-l-255. If byte one of any file (or 
peek(X)) is zero, that's the end of the catalog. 

Line 260 looks for deleted files (with peek(X)=255) and skips them. 
Remove this line and the "and P<255" in line 150, and you will display 
deleted file names. 

Line 270 first determines where on the text screen each file name will 
be printed, according to its number. Then it looks at the third byte of 
each file, the file type byte, and subtracts 128 if the file is locked to get the 
correct file type value. 

Line 280 prints the file type in inverse type and a lock/unlock code in 
normal. Using "+" for locked instead of the usual asterisk causes less 
screen clutter. This command requires at least a Basic explanation: 

PRINT CHR$(324-11*(PEEK(X + 2) >127)) 



This just means, "Print the character whose ASCII value is 32 (space) or, 
if peek(X+2) > 127 (file-locked), print the character whose ASCII value is 
32+ 1 1, or 43 (plus sign). Change the 1 1 to a 10 if you want the normal 
asterisk to indicate a locked file. 

Now we can finally print each file name by peeking at its fourth byte 
and the bytes that follow, until our maximum length, L, is reached. 

Line 300 puts the cursor to the bottom left of the screen. This is 
where that nice file menu program you are about to write takes over. 

File Locker. And now (at no extra charge) a utility that will lock or 
unlock all of the files in a catalog, fast. The System Master disk's FID 
program already does the same thing, but it's written in machine lan- 
guage, so you can't easily see what makes it work, and besides, this Ap- 
plesoft routine is faster and more fun to watch. 

Watch out — this program writes to the disk, so test it on a friend's 
disk before you risk your own. . . .

The key to this program is in lines 190 and 200, which add 128 to 
(lock) or subtract 128 from (unlock) the third byte of each file. Line 210 
is optional; it prints each file's name on the screen as it is encountered. 

Line 220 writes to the disk. You might want to install a rem in front 
of the call 768 until you are pretty sure things are working correctly.

The Schoolhouse Apple 

by Jean Varven 




"In each of us, there rests tremendous power waiting to be 
liberated. ... The primary wealth of the future will come from the 
human mind." 

These remarks were made by California Governor Edmund G. 
Brown, Jr., in his keynote address at EdCom, the computers in educa- 
tion conference held at the Los Angeles Convention Center in late 
October. 

In January of this year, Governor Brown signed into law Califor- 
nia's Investment in People program. The $25.7 million program empha- 
sizes the importance of recognizing and developing human potential and 
putting it to wise use as we make the transition into the Information Age. 
The program is founded on the assumption that 50 percent of future new 
jobs will depend, directly or indirectly, on new technologies, and people 
of all ages and backgrounds would do best to be prepared. 

Investment in People addresses five general areas: improving the 
quality of math and computer education in elementary and high schools, 
establishing training programs at the community colleges, attracting and 
maintaining qualified engineering and science faculty at the university 
level, implementing employment development aimed at training or re- 
training California workers, and linking with private industry to ensure 
that training programs prepare people for actual jobs. 

At the elementary and high school levels in particular, teacher train- 
ing is a real concern. The plan is that fifteen teacher education and com- 
puter centers will be established around the state to provide teachers with 
training and resources. One of these fifteen centers will become a soft- 
ware clearinghouse and evaluation center for the entire state. Existing 
computer centers in Santa Clara, San Mateo, and Alameda counties 
have been used as models for the centers that are being created now. 

Teachers will be able to take advantage of in-depth institutes dur- 
ing the summer and in-service training sessions during the school year. 
There will be sessions designed to give science, math, and computer 
teachers a "crash course" to help them be better prepared to instruct 
their students. And there will be other courses aimed at helping teachers 
of all subject areas become more comfortable around and knowledge- 
able about computers. Money has also been set aside to make it finan- 
cially feasible for junior high schools and high schools to send teachers to 
such events. 

Funds are also available to educational and private institutions for 
the creation of innovative model programs to train teachers and moti- 
vate students. Requests for funding will be considered by the newly 
formed Advisory Council on Technology Education, established by the 
State Department of Education. 

It's obvious California will be one of the states to watch and learn 
from during the coming year. Various educators and groups, including 
San Jose based Computer Using Educators and the Santa Clara County 
Office of Education, are actively involved in making sure that Invest- 
ment in People pays off. 

College Board Update. A great many people are eager to learn more 
about the College Board sponsored Advanced Placement Computer Sci- 
ence course. So many teachers, parents, and students have contacted the 
College Board in recent months that the organization has published a 
preliminary edition of the booklet that describes the course. 

Available from the Educational Testing Service (Princeton NJ 
08541; 609-921-9000; $2), the booklet explains how the College Board's 
advanced placement system operates. It also provides addresses and 
phone numbers of the organization's regional offices, whose staff can be 
contacted for further information and guidance. 

The booklet includes a description of the course goals and a topic 



outline, along with sample multiple choice questions (with answer key) 
and free response questions (with suggested responses). It responds to 
such issues as who can offer the AP course, what the student prere- 
quisites are, and what equipment and facilities are needed and why. The 
issue of why Pascal was chosen over Basic as the language students must 
know is also addressed. 

Not everyone knows exactly what's covered in a college-level course 
in computer science, so not everyone will be familiar with the terms used 
in the course outline. In recognition of this, the College Board has in- 
cluded helpful explanatory information about programming methodol- 
ogy, the features of programming languages, data types and structures, 
algorithms, the applications of computing, computer systems, and the 
social implications of computer use. A bibliography is also provided. 

Still More Company Capsules. Let's look now at two more compa- 
nies that produce educational software for the Apple.

DECEMBER 1982 



Many of Britannica's programs are scheduled for release sometime in 
the coming year, and a few, including Problem Solving in Algebra, Biol- 
ogy — Energy and Life, and Biology — The Cell are due this month. 

Produced for the company by John Haugo of EduSystems, Problem 
Solving in Algebra is intended for use by junior high and high school stu- 
dents. The package consists of five disks, supplemented by a teacher's 
manual that explains the instructional appoach taken. Topics covered in- 
clude functions, variables, number sentences, equality, translating verbal 
and math sentences, solving equations with one, two, or three un- 
knowns, and systems of equations. 

Biology — Energy and Life is designed to be used by high school biol- 
ogy students who are studying the interrelationship between energy and 
organisms. Energy sources, energy pyramids, chemical pathways, and 
aerobic and anaerobic . respiration are covered, and the material is pre- 
sented by means of hi-res graphics simulations, interactive tutorials, and 
drill and practice reinforcement exercises. 

William Claiborne and the Sorus Group produced this two-disk pro- 
gram for Britannica. It comes with a teacher's manual and its special 
features include branching, three levels of difficulty, and a glossary of 
terms and concepts. In addition, the cause/effect relationship between 
energy and organisms is explained by means of moving graphics. 

Also produced by William Claiborne and the Sorus Group, Biol- 
ogy — TTie Cell is a two-disk program that covers cell theory. Major 
topics discussed include cell biology, cell organizafion, the structure and 
function of organelles, the macromolecules of the cell, and viruses. Like 
Energy and Life, this program features multiple skill levels, glossary, 
graphics simulation, and a teacher's manual. 

McGraw-Hill Book Company, Webster/EDL/McGraw-Hill, 1221 
Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020; (800) 223-4180. 

This particular division of McGraw-Hill produces educational soft- 
ware intended primarily for use in schools. Programs include Introduc- 
tion to Microcomputers, the Math Drill and Practice Series, and the 
Search Series. 

Using the Apple version of Introduction to Microcomputers, teachers 



of third through sixth graders can introduce their students to simple 
computer terminology, the parts of the computer, and basic keyboard- 
ing skills. Developed by John Haugo of EduSystems, the program 
employs a game format to help students learn about the computer. 

The Math Drill and Practice Series, also by John Haugo, consists of 
Math Skill Games, twelve drill and practice programs at three skill levels 
in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; Math Word Games, 
a six-program package that helps students develop skill in solving math 
word problems; and Math Regrouping Games, a ten-program drill and 
practice package that promotes the development of regrouping/renam- 
ing skills in addition and subtraction. 

The Search Series was created by Thomas F. F. Snyder of Computer 
Learning Connection. These five simulations challenge students at the 
older elementary school and high school levels to develop problem-solv- 
ing and communications skills. Usable in classroom situations where 
there is only one computer, the programs also require students to read 
supplementary materials and to develop good note-taking abilities. 

Topics covered in the Search Series include geography, geology, 
community, energy, and archaeology. Each program in the series comes 
with student workbooks, which can be reordered, and a teacher's man- 
ual that contains helpful suggestions about how to structure the searches 
and numerous suggestions for supplementing the lessons. 

Read All About It. If you aren't a regular subscriber to the Apple 
Education News, you may want to consider becoming one. 

Published quarterly, Apple Education News contains short, informa- 
tive articles about people using Apples in schools and other educational 
settings. Included in the current issue (volume 3, number 3) is informa- 
tion about Apple Horizons, a new "get acquainted seminar" for educa- 
tors and trainers who want to learn more about the Apple. The semi- 
nar's four one-hour modules cover how to operate the Apple, educational 
applications, software selection guidelines, and what factors to consider 
when you're thinking of purchasing a microcomputer. 

For more information about the seminar, contact your local Apple 
dealer. And to become an Apple Education News subscriber, write to Ap- 
ple Computer Inc., 20525 Mariani Avenue, Cupertino, CA 95014. Sub- 
scriptions are free for the asking. 

Speaking of publications, the second volume of the Apple Journal of 
Courseware Review, published by the Apple Education Foundation, is as 
good as the first. Stop by your Apple dealer or a major bookstore and 
take a look at it. 

Centering In. They go by names like microcomputer learning cen- 
ter, computer resource center, and computer education institute. And 
they're cropping up all over the place — in libraries and community cen- 
ters, on school and college campuses, as nonprofit corporations, and as 
private enterprises. But wherever they're located and whatever they're 
called, places where people can learn about and use computers are be- 
coming more and more a part of the national landscape. 

What's the setup of a typical computer learning centei? Is there such 
a thing as a typical center? What resources can you expect to find there? 
And what do you learn when you visit such a place? How do classes in- 
tended for adults and classes designed for kids diffei? Is anyone offering 
courses where adults and kids learn together? 

Who are some of the people who teach at or have established a com- 
puter center or education institute? What prompted them to get in- 
volved in this aspect of education? 

These are some of the questions we'll consider in a future installment 
of this column when we take a look at computer learning environments 
of various sizes and purposes in different parts of the country. 

Meantime, if you're affiliated with such a center, why not write in 
and tell us something about it? Your input will help us get a balanced 
picture of the kinds of computer education that are being offered at pres- 
ent. And if you haven't ever visited or attended classes at a computer 
learning center, why not write in anyway to describe some of the things 
you'd like to see in such a place. Write to: Softalk School, Box 60, 1 1 160

Breakthroughs occur once in a great while, when a 
product emerges that goes beyond imagination. It 
defines new territory. If that product is a computer 
simulation, it will leave the crowded field of carbon- 
copy Space Invaders far behind. 



Rendezvous . . . the breakthrou g h is here. 

Rendezvous accurately simulates the orbital 
flig ht of a space shuttle craft. During the 
liftoff and orbital rendezvous stages, exact 
systems of ballistics and orbital mechanics 
require you to master Earth's gravitational 
force. Once you achieve orbit, the 
disorientation of a frictionless, 
zero-gravity environment 
complicates your maneuvers. 
Throughout the final stages of 
alignment and docking, you will 
view the rotating, 3-dimensional 
space station as it would appear in a 
space craft's anterior window. 



,From liftoff to docking. Rendezvous tests the limits 
of your technical understanding, mathematical 
judgment, and raw perceptual skill.

LOGO 

XHEXUJOLE 

BY lin nULLER 

A certain bit of magic seems to fill the air when a hyperactive child is 
poring over a computer console. To the uninitiated, the intensity of 
concentration can be mind-boggling — ^they find it totally incomprehen- 
sible that a child whose attention span rarely exceeds ten minutes else- 
where will sit at a computer console for an hour or more. 

Such is the magic of Logo. 

Hyperactivity is among the more easily discernible learning disabili- 
ties that seem to set certain children apart as "different." They may be 
classed as "discipline problems." Or maybe they just "don't pay atten- 
tion." 

There are other young people who don't seem to fit into any of the 
discernible categories. They are best described as "shadow children." 
These children may not be quite as intelligent as others when measured 
by standardized tests. Some may have behavior problems. Others just 
don't seem to be able to learn. These are the children who live in the shad- 
ows of the academicians, the athletes, the student council leaders — you 
know, the popular ones. 

Over the past decade, some innovative teachers have helped some of 
these kids come out of the shadows. It doesn't happen very easily. Most 
certainly, it doesn't happen very quickly. It comes one small triumph at a 
time, and the process is often painfully slow. But the results can bring 
tears of joy to your eyes. 

One of the most serious problems shadow children face concerns 
their image of themselves. They seek to learn, but not to be ridiculed or 
embarrassed in front of their peers. They long to learn with other young- 
sters, but their lifelong sense of fear, frustration, shyness, confusion, in- 
timidation, and, in some cases, panic, makes this exceedingly difficult. 

In the seventies, some teachers began to use the calculator as a learn- 
ing aid for slow learners. Lessons were individualized to meet the sp)e- 
cific needs of each child. Each child was thus challenged and motivated 
to move ahead at his or her own pace. More important, each was in con- 
trol of the learning process. Thus, these children got what was for some 
their first taste of self-confidence, their first exercise in decision making 
and problem analysis. 

Ever since the computer began to move into the classroom, these 
same innovative teachers have tried to expand their horizons, looking to 
the amazing processing power of the computer for help. However, the 
transition from calculator to computer has not been as easy as you might 
expect. 

Calculators use unique single-keystroke languages to translate nu- 
merical inputs into Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) calculations. There's 
no high-level language to learn. You define the problem, press the few re- 
quired keys in a logical order, and the result appears in the display. 

Unfortunately, learning to use a microcomputer is not quite that sim- 
ple. Until recently, the learning of high-level computer languages has 
posed a serious challenge to young people, especially the shadow chil- 
dren. Init, goto, gosub, chrS, midS, hgr, and similar words 
are not part of the everyday vocabulary. Simple programs can be writ- 
ten in Basic, of course. But these are not the imaginative, interactive pro- 
cedures Logo makes possible. What types of challenges do Logo proce- 
dures offer? 



ross Llues: 
The unique word 
challenge game. 

It offers intellectual stimulation arcade games can't 
match . . . with all the excitement. 

Fast-action fun isn't just for mystery or arcade games any 
more. Cross Clues is a word game that tests more than 
mere reflexes. It's the mind-challenging evolution of the 
crossword puzzle, with beat-the-clock excitement. The 
playing tempo is lively, but you decide how fast you want 
to go. The computer "umpires" while you compete with 
another player for hidden words, coaxing clues from the 
computer. Since a clue helps your opponent too, suspense 
builds till the end. when the best combination of skill, 
intellect, timing and luck wins. 

If you're ready for an even greater challenge, try 
Concentration Crosswords]" a game that offers 3 levels 
of difficulty and 3 ways to play — for even the most 
demanding word whiz. Again, you compete against the 
clock to uncover hidden words. But once discovered, they 
disappear, to test your memory. Here, a combination of 
word skills, intellect, memory and luck determine the 
winner. 

Both games offer 50 mind-boggling puzzles that appeal 
to young teens through adults. Try them both! You may 
find you've matched wits with monsters and space critters 
long enough.

DECEMBER 1982 



Shadow children often develop a very personal relationship with the 
computer. They work one-on-one with a very patient and tireless ma- 
chine that provides immediate feedback and reinforcement. Instead of 
being embarrassed in front of peers or the teacher when they give an in- 
correct answer, they simply try again. And when they choose, their suc- 
cess can always be shared by showing the computer display to any and 
all in the class. 

But what have they really learned? 

When a child with cerebral palsy is able to control her hands well 
enough to hit the keys required to draw a square on the computer screen, 
it's easy to applaud her concentration. But what of a shadow child? If 
that child has been left alone to explore the computer by means of self-di- 
rected study, then how will the teacher know what went on when all she 
can see is the completed square. Was that square put there by random se- 
lection or by choice? How many steps did it take the child to put that 
square on the screen? How many mistakes were made? Did the child un- 
derstand the lesson? Was the child able to translate other experiences 
from real life to the computer screen? What really happened? 

The beauty of Logo is that single-keystroke procedures can be writ- 
ten that allow a student to scribble, to doodle, or to create geometric 
masterpieces. Every step is remembered by the computer and retained 
for later recall. Because of this, the teacher can measure how well the stu- 
dent has been able to structure the thought processes that are necessary 
to make the logic of Logo work. 

The student creates a unique micro-learning environment in which he 
or she becomes the decision maker. One small triumph at a time, a child 
learns to look at problems analytically; to break each into components 
that can then be reassembled to solve the seemingly insurmountable 
problem. 

The tendency of many teachers would be to look over the student's 
shoulder. But this would most likely intimidate the child they were ob- 
serving. Shadow children need all the help they can get to build confi- 



dence in themselves. They desperately need that sense of accomplish- 
ment coupled with the practice of structured problem-solving. They 
don't need constant scrutiny. 

Better that there would be a procedure that would remember all the 
steps the student took and then play them back later for unobtrusive 
analysis. 

A new friend from Canada recently submitted just such a single-key- 
stroke procedure to the Young Peoples' Logo Association Software Ex- 
change. It's a significant first step toward helping very young children 
and those who are physically and mentally disabled. It has the capacity 
to remember all entries and then later to recall these on command. 

This procedure has been introduced to a school for the learning dis- 
abled in Dallas, Texas. Educators in other settings have expressed an in- 
terest in the procedure and are receiving updates for their use. It's of- 
fered here for consideration and possible use by any and all. If you 
should find useful adaptations or perfections of this procedure, keep in 
touch with Softalk and the YPLA so your success can be shared with 
others.

Free Enterprise 

A business management game 

You run your own company making decisions based 
on economic factors and the actions of competitors. 

It's your opportunity to sit on top and run a corporation. 
Free Enterprise, based on an IBM-developed simulation 
for training top-level managers, is as surprising and 
demanding as the real world. 

It lets you face the same on-your-toes challenges you 
would in running a real business: pricing products, 
determining budgets for advertising, production, plant 
improvement, and R&D. Even securing bank loans and 
deciding on stockholder dividends. You use computer 
generated reports to make decisions. But if you're wrong 
you could go bankrupt. Only the shrewd survive! 

Free Enterprise can be played at three competency levels 
so novices can compete with the more experienced, and 
from one to six can play. It's the perfect chance to learn 
about the free enterprise system — to practice business 
strategies — and to enjoy it — with no risks. 

Simulation components: disk, user's manual, pad of 50 
record sheets, and pad of 50 decision sheets.

UPON A TIME 

You guys have screwed up in a royal way. 

— The Fairy Godmother 

Feature filmmaking has changed in the last two decades. In the 
twenties, thirties, and forties, Hollywood was the undisputed film capital 
of the world. Gradually the emphasis has shifted away from Los An- 
geles and the big studios. Hollywood and feature filmmaking have 
become a state of mind, transportable to other environments. 

Across the Golden Gate Bridge in the beautiful coastal mountains of 
northern California's Marin County, the spirit of Hollywood is strong. 
The mighty prince of the area is George Lucas, whose Lucasfilm Ltd. is 
based in San Rafael. Academy Award-winning filmmaker John Korty 
works out of nearby Mill Valley. Not coincidentally, the two have joined 
forces on a film project that is a maverick, a step out of line. It's called 
Twice Upon a Time. 

The Revenge of Marin County. The feeling around Hollywood is 
that you shouldn't do a full-length animated film unless you choose a 
classic story that everyone knows. Original stories are not presumed to be a 
be a good bet for drawing an audience. One has only to look at animated 
films from the last few years to see this philosophy being tested. Let's see, 
there was Watership Down, Lord of the Rings, The Secret of NIMH, and 
Metamorphoses (which was based on Greek mythology). 

John Korty, "against everybody's advice," has just finished a fea- 
ture-length animated motion picture based on an idea he first thought of 
more than ten years ago. Korty had a childhood fantasy that he 
believes is fairly common. 

'it was that if I blinked my eyes, maybe everything would suddenly 
change." Ever since, Korty has been refining this notion into a story. 
This spring people all around the country will have the chance to share 
his fantasy. 

''Twice Upon a Time is not just another cartoon," Korty explains, 
while lounging on the front porch of the gray Victorian mansion that is 
the hub of his company, Korty Films. "The cartoon world is supposed to 
be better than the real world — escapist. The old way was to create an 
idyllic fantasy land. I feel that something animated must allow your 
imagination to have fun. That happens in Twice Upon a Time, but you 
also come away with the feeling that the real world is the best we'll 
ever get." 

The Divine Animated Comedy. In the film there are three worlds. 
There is the world of the Murkworks, where nightmares are hammered 
out on a gigantic typewriter. Ralph and Mumford, the two heroes of the 
film, come fi-om Frivoli, a world where sweet dreams are baked like pies. 
And the harried people who receive these two kinds of dreams are the 
Rushers of Din. That's us here in the real world. 

Paunchy and raunchy Synonamess Botch is the maniacal ruler of the 
Murkworks Nightmare Factory, and he's jealous of Greensleeves, an 
eccentric old leprechaun who delivers nice dreams. 

Botch convinces Ralph and Mumford to freeze time in Din by re- 
leasing the Magic Spring from the Cosmic Clock. Ralph and Mum- 
ford's fairy godmother, complete with Brooklyn accent, berates them for 
the "mucho imbalance" they've caused. 

The major portion of the film follows Ralph and Mumford's etlorls 
to retrieve the Magic Spring before Botch's minions drop thousands ol 
nightmare bombs on Din. Along the way, our heroes meet Flora Flaun.t

The top picture was taken from 
the back of one of the Apple- 
controlled animation cameras. 
At the top of the picture is the 
mirror reflecting the artwork to 
be animated. The camera is 
just to the left, out of view. The 
bottom picture shows the 
artwork on its movable bed, 
right side up, as the animator 
would see it. Since the camera 
is in an inaccessible spot, a 
video link-up is used to see 
how the image looks through 
the camera. One person can 
operate the whole system, 
exploring different possibilities 
and thus taking the risk out of 
heretofore expensive 
multiplane animation. 




an aspiring movie star and the heroes' heartthrob. The fairy godmother 
calls for assistance from Rod Rescueman, a recent graduate (D- aver- 
age) from Superhero School. Other characters include I bor, half-gorilla, 
half-robot; Ratatooie, Botch's pet rat /armadillo; and Scuzzbopper, 
Botch's head Screamwriter. 

Like any good fantasy story, Twice Upon a Time has unlikely heroes, 
a quest, lots of magic, and a happy ending — the cosmic balance is 
restored. 

Luminously Lucky. The story behind the making of Twice Upon a 
Time is magical and miraculous, befitting the spirit of the holiday season. 
It cost a miraculously low sum of money — around four and a half mil- 
lion dollars — to make. A new style of animation dubbed Lumage (lumi- 
nous image) is introduced in the film and Apples are a crucial part of the 
process. 

Lumage is an appealing cutout style animation that uses top and 
bottom lighting. There is full character movement on several different 
planes. Multiplane shots are done economically, using an Apple to con- 
trol the movements of the camera. 

When megabuck magician George Lucas saw Korty's short trial film 
using Lumage animation, he was so impressed that he agreed to ap- 
proach powerful lords of filmdom for financing. Korty and Lucas, who 



have been friends for more than a decade, went down to the ancient mys- 
terious film capital in late 1979. 

"We screened a trial reel for the Ladd Company. A month later we 
had a production deal signed. For Hollywood that's fast," Korty says. 

Lucas assumed the role of executive producer on the film and has 
been a fatherly figure, offering advice, criticism, and technical support. 
Twice Upon a Time is the first feature-length animated film project that 
the three companies — Lucasfilm, Korty Films, and the Ladd 
Company — have ever been involved with. It's a gamble, but one that 
should pay off. 

You may not see his name on the "one sheet" (Hollywood's name 
for the typical twenty-seven inch by forty-one inch theater poster), but 
John Baker can take a lot of credit for the success of Lumage. Baker, 
technical director of Twice Upon a Time, designed the animation cam- 
eras. He used Apples to do it and wrote the software that allows Apples 
to control the finished product. He also lent to the produaion his talents 
as a photographer. 

A frequent feature of the film is animation against the backdrop of a 
black and white picture. Animated figures appear to walk through a fro- 
zen, colorless world. 

In one scene, the two heroes wander through a bar occupied by giant.

Statuelike humans, halted in time. The photographs used in achieving 
this effect, and, in fact, many of the photographs that appear as black 
and white backgrounds in the film, were taken by Baker. 

Baker majored in physics and mathematics at the University of New 
Orleans, but eventually he became heavily involved in photography. In 
1975, he came to Korty Films as a freelance photographer. 

Before he finished his stint with the film company, Baker became 
interested in Korty's ideas for an animation camera. Someone jokingly 
told Baker that he might be back someday to help design that camera. 
Several years later, while working as a physics researcher at Lawrence 
Berkeley Lab, Baker got the call. 

By this time he was the owner of an Apple and had taught himself to 
program in Applesoft and assembly language. 

The atmosphere at Korty Films in late 1979, at the beginning of the 
Twice Upon a Time project, was hectic. The money had come in. Korty 
wanted to start filming in five months. He wanted a camera that could 
do specific things, and it had to fit in a Victorian bedroom without tear- 
ing down the walls. 

Baker spent about two weeks wriUng a program that would calcu- 
late and display different camera designs. This called for determining 
many factors involving the placement of mirrors and how light rays 
would fall. 

Most animation systems have the film camera suspended above the 
material being photographed. The lens points straight down onto the 
artwork. The distance between camera and artwork reaches astronom- 
ical proportions — more than twenty feet in the case of Disney's famous 
multiplane cameras. 

Victorian Dreams in the Third Dimension. In order to fit the system 
into one of Korty's not overly spacious Virtorian bedrooms and still 
achieve the effect of three-dimensionality that's possible with multiple 
planes. Baker had to develop a scheme of reflecting mirrors. The Apple 
helped him select from the multitude of possible geometries when differ- 



ent variations are used in the placement of key elements. Baker's com- 
puter-aided design program allowed him to move mirrors around in re- 
lation to the camera and artwork, while varying the intensity and direc- 
tion of light. 

Baker never seemed to have any doubts that the system would work. 
"When they found out over at Lucasfilm what we were up to, they shook 
their heads, 'Oh boy.' They thought it couldn't be done." 

The final product is difficult to describe (see pictures), but it works. 

The artwork is placed on two large rectangular beds, or axes, and one 
squarish, floating axis. These parts of the system are at waist level and are 
the most accessible to animators. 

The camera sits back behind the rectangular beds and points toward 
the ceiling, where it picks up the illuminated image through a series of 
mirrors hanging over the artwork. 

The two large rectangular beds, referred to as the top and bottom 
east /west axes, are close together but move independently of each other. 
The one floating axis is smaller than the other two but can move any- 
where in the image area. The camera itself can rotate and zoom, provid- 
ing two additional axes of movement. The mirrors scan across the art- 
work providing the north/south axis. 

Operating the whole thing fast and simply is accomplished using an 
Apple II Plus equipp>ed with two disk drives, a printer, a camera con- 
troller with an external input, and a modified, single-frame Sony video- 
tape deck. Baker had an I/O board custom-built that controls the ana- 
log relay between the Apple and the camera controller. The computer's 
keyboard is color coded, and the important keys are labeled for specific 
operating functions. 

Supervising animator Brian Narelle is candid when he talks about 
using the Apple. An experienced animator who has worked on segments 
of "Sesame Street" and "The Midnight Special," Narelle had never used 
a computer-controlled camera before working on Twice Upon a Time. 

On the one hand, he says, it takes pressure off the animator. "Before,

Left: What the animators see when they're in the driver's seat. The Apple's keyboard is 
color coded for easy use. Above that is the camera controller and a monitor showing 
the video link-up. The monitor at right displays the programming options available to 
the animator. Above: Animator John Armstrong, supervising animator Brian Narelle, 
and technical director John Baker. Baker designed the Lumage cameras with an Apple 
II and wrote the software that enables an Apple to control the camera's movements. 



I used a calculator to plan all the movements in a shot. But the com- 
puter also causes some anxiety at first because it's so foreign." 

Apparently the operating manual Baker wrote wasn't much help, at 
least not to the computer-illiterate. "Look at this," says Narelle. "It's all 
text and no clear instructions on what's most important." 

Narelle, besides being an animator, is an actor (he played the wacky 
spaceship captain in Dan O'Bannon's Dark Star) and enough of a writer 
to put together "An Animator's Guide to Computer Operation." Punc- 
tuated with humorous drawings and illustrations, Narelle's guide is 
meant for those present and future animators at Korty Films who are 
unfamiliar with microcomputers. 

This Way to Animated Apples. Once the artwork is in place on the 
axes, booting up and getting started means flipping a lot of switches. 
After that, it's possible for one animator to work the entire system fast 
and simply. For instance, if you want to move one or more axis you first 
hit the GOTO key, in this case the key B. Then you enter the axis desired, 
let's say the east/west top. Then enter the position you want the camera 
to move to on an x, y grid. Then hit return and the space bar, or go bar. 
The whole plane moves, somewhat noisily, powered by stepping 
motors. Through the video feed, it looks like the camera is moving left 
to right. 

Suppose you're actually planning out a move for a shot. You want to 
have a specific axis position for a particular frame of the shot. First you 
hit C, or the position key. Then you enter the axis desired, let's say the 
north/south axis, which is the S key. Then you enter the position and the 
frame number that you want. You can punch the O key, or text key, to 
check your entry. Hit text again and it returns you to the input mode. 

All animation is done frame by frame. In Twice Upon a Time, every 
second of animation is made up of twenty-four separate images. One ter- 
rific feature of this system, from the animator's standpoint, is that the 
computer can take over the execution of a shot. You can tell the camera 
to move from one spot to another spot in as many frames as you wish, 
and the computer will automatically execute the move. The animators 
just sit back and decide if they like how it looks. 

The video feed and the computer's ability to show any part or parts of 
the shot makes the animator's job free of guessing and risk taking. 
Before, the wait to see the results of a complicated shot might have been 
as long as two weeks. Baker's system promotes trial and error but makes 
it a speedy process. 

Some complicated shots require several passes with the camera. With 



Baker's system you make the first pass and then the shot's movements 
are stored in the computer for later recall. 

Suppose you have a scene where a character walks behind a boulder. 
You make one pass showing the character walking along, but when he 
gets to the boulder it's been blacked out with a sheet of paper. The film is 
then backed up in the camera and you make another pass without the 
sheet of paper over the boulder. 

Enterprising Space Opera. In big budget special effeas films like 
The Empire Strikes Back or Star Trek The Wrath of Khan, filming a 
spectacularly lit spaceship flying against a star field is a complicated pro- 
cedure involving many individual pieces of film. In order to expose prop- 
erly all portions of such a scene, the ship would be photographed once 
with only its outside lights on. A second piece of film would track the 
same movement, but this time only the interior lights would be lit, and so 
on. The end result is usually several pieces of film that have to be sand- 
wiched together on one final print in the lab. 

Baker's system gives the same look of uniform lighting and layered 
effects, but only one piece of film is used. Thanks to the Apple's ability to 
remember the movements of a shot, innumerable repetitions can be 
made without resulting in an unsynchronized, unmatched mess. Some ef- 
fects, such as a slow dissolve (one scene fading into another), still have to 
be done in the lab, though Baker's system even has a provision for that. 

When writing the programs for operating the camera, Baker's biggest 
problem was space. He rapidly ran out of memory for storing the com- 
bined Applesoft and assembly language programs. Saturn's 32K expan- 
sion board solved that problem. Flis finished program includes 6K or 7K 
of assembly language and around 30K of Applesoft. The Saturn board 
stores DOS, the assembly language programs, and any large arrays for a 
specific shot. The second disk drive is reserved for storing shots to be 
used at a later time. 

One of Baker's goals is to translate the programs into Forth, the 
standard language nowadays for motion control. "I don't want to do it 
though," he says, grinning. "I think I'll find someone to do it for me." 

Baker's camera also includes a joystick mode. Custom-built by 
Baker, two joysticks side by side control the camera and the various axes. 
This makes it even easier for an animator to look at various possibilities 
for a shot. 

Multiplane shots are the highpoint of any animated film, and Twice 
Upon a Time has quite a few. One, involving an old-fashioned steam 
engine racing through an urban landscape, took about two weeks to film

in its entirety. Close to fifteen passes were made to get all the effects right. 
Even so, two weeks is nothing. 

"Other people stay away from those kinds of shots, because there's 
too much risk involved," explains Narelle. 

Once Upon a Preview Glimpse. It's tough to tell how successful 
Lumage is before seeing Twice Upon a Time on the big screen. On a 
twenty-inch color video monitor in producer Bill Couturie's office, seg- 
ments of the finished film looked refreshingly original compared to most 
recent /American animation. The style is reminiscent of eastern Euro- 
pean animation — Hungarian or Czechoslovakian. No attempt has been 
made to be painstakingly realistic, a standard that tends to bog down 
Disney's best efforts. Instead, the film is meant to look and feel like a 
fantasy. 

Both in the look and movement, codirector Charles Swenson and 
Brian Narelle have created characters that are comical and crazy, but not 
overly cartoonish. One of the heroes, Ralph, is an all-purpose animal. 
Ralph has the ability to change into any animal he wishes, but he hasn't 
mastered the trick yet. 

One scene in the film has Ralph, who normally looks something like 
a dog, being chased by one of the villain's flying vulture minions. Ralph 
is running to avoid sharp talons and yells, "Duck!" Well, he turns into a 
quacker, much to his disadvantage. The scene is superbly animated and 
very funny. 

The spectacular multiplane shots should do justice to the big screen. 
The steam engine shot is one of the high points of Twice Upon a Time. 
Another beautiful shot of a submarinelike creature in the dismal land- 
scape of Bone Mountain has luscious aqua hues and eerie luminous 
lighting. The movement of the camera following the creature is flawless. 
As Narelle is fond of saying, "You can take your yellow submarine and 
stuff it." 

Twice Upon a Time is long on visual splendor, but it is also an audio 
pleasure. The score was composed by Dawn Atkinson and Ken Mel- 
ville. Ms. Atkinson is the second woman to conduct the London Sym- 
phony to date. 

The Dolby Empire Strikes Back. Sound effects also play a large part 
in the film. The Keatonlike Mumford is heard through funny sounds, 
like Harpo and his bicycle horn. When Scuzzbopper pounds the tripe- 
writer keys with mallets, the sound is thundering. The sound mix for 
Twice Upon a Time was the first project to be done at the brand-new Lu- 
casfilm sound studio in San Rafael. Revenge of the Jedi is next in line. 

The content of Twice Upon a Time is worth all the lavish care that is 
being given. Original stories like this one make the millionaire master- 
minds of Hollywood reconsider their elaborate think-tank strategies. 

Korty created the basic characters and situation, while a number of 
people take credit for writing the actual screenplay. Codirectors Charles 
Swenson and Korty, producer Bill Couturie, and associate producer Su- 
ella Kennedy all contributed to the writing of Twice Upon a Time. Even 
Baker contributed the name Murkworks. 

Korty' s original idea has turned into quite a work of art. He wanted 
to make a sophisticated family film. 

"Last year I went to see Time Bandits. I looked around the theater 
and realized how long a time it had been since I'd seen families together 
at the movies." 

Personal Best. When you do a movie, it never ends up the way you 
first saw it. That first vision is but a start, to be changed depending on 
who gets involved. "I guess Twice Upon a Time got more commercial 
than how I first imagined it," Korty laughs. "You always want every 
movie to do everything. It's not as personal a film to me as it was years 
ago, but it's very good and entertaining." 

, Korty has great admiration for Baker's talents. The tall, lanky native 
of Louisiana will have to get used to such praise once the world gets a 
load of Lumage. It's not surprising, when you think about it, that a 
Baker and Apples would make a healthy combination. 

Korty and company would very much like to make another ani- 
mated feature using Lumage. Everyone there feels that a second film 
would be made richer and even better than the first. Let's hope Holly- 
wood gets the message.

DECEMBER 1982 




BESIMNERS 

Corner 



When the Apple II was first introduced, there wasn't much software 
available for it. What little there was usually came on a cassette that you 
could load from once every three tries, if you were lucky. To provide 
software for Apple owners, Apple Computer encouraged its early custom- 
ers who knew how to program (almost all did in those days) to submit 
their better programs to the Apple Software Bank so that others could 
use them also. 

About fifty of the best of these submissions were issued in five vol- 
umes of contributed programs and made available to Apple owners 
without charge through their dealers. All you had to do was to bring in a 
disk for each volume you wanted or, preferably, purchase a box of disks 
from your dealer and use the dealer's Apple and twin drives to copy the 
programs onto your new disks. For a few dollars extra, you could buy 
two instruction manuals. Contributed Programs Volumes I and 2 and 
Contributed Programs Volumes 3—5: Bonus Issue. 

You may recognize the names of the authors of some of these pro- 
grams. Paul Lutus, creator of Electric Duet and GraForth, contributed 
three programs, including one for Morse code training and another that 
converts among decimal, hex, and binary numbers — enter one, and in a 
moment you'll see the other two. Mike Markkula, president of Apple 
Computer, wrote a four-function math drill with a color display that re- 
quired only 8K of memory so it would fit the 16K machine that was then 
Apple's standard product. 

Then there's Mastermind, a version of the very popular game in 
which your opponent (in this case, the computer) chooses the colored 
pieces and the order in which they are hidden and lets you do the guess- 
ing and deductions. This program was contributed by Steve Wozniak, 
the youthful inventor of the Apple. And an unknown with the nom de 
plume of J. Apple Sede (rumor has it that Markkula might have had a 
hand in this, too) wrote a database package that is still useful today. 

A number of these programs are now unquestionably obsolete. Most 
were written in Integer Basic, which still comes on every Apple's System 
Master but requires a language card or RAM card to load. And most are 
horribly slow compared to today's hi-res machine language programs. 
One shoot-'em-up game between a battleship and some submarines re- 
quires eight jerky moves and sixteen seconds for your ship to charge 
across the screen; it also has a full two-second lag between the time you 
push the button and the time your depth charge is dropped. Can you 
imagine Hadron or Alien Rain played that way? 

Some of these programs are still very much worth having, especially 
when you consider the price and especially if you're a beginner. One nice 
full-color game, for example, is Othello (also known as Reversi). This is a 
two-player version in which you use the game paddles for positioning 
your markers. While you can't play against the computer, the program 
does make sure that none of the markers that should be turned over is 
missed. On the same disk are a blackjack game, a slot machine, Yahtzee, 
pinball, and Hammurabi. The pinball game's no Raster Blaster, but for a 
lo-res Basic program with a square ball, it's impressive. 

Besides being free, these contributed volumes had another wonderful 
feature. Except where machine language was needed for execution speed. 



they were written in Basic and saved on unprotected disks. And some of 
them had plenty of rem statements describing what a program was do- 
ing so they could serve as examples for the beginning programmer. In 
fart, Apple Computer encouraged people to list and examine them as a 
way of learning programming. To help users study them, some of the 
programs in volumes three and five were given line-by-line commentary 
in the accompanying manual. 

These contributed volumes are still available and — although some- 
times hard to find — still free and yours for the price of a disk. Apple 
Computer confirms that Apple dealers are still supposed to let their cus- 
tomers copy these programs onto their own disks. Because the programs 
go back at least four years, they were all supplied on DOS 3.2 disks. If 
your dealer's disks haven't been upgraded to 3.3, use Muffin rather than 
Copy or CopyA to bring your copy up to 3.3 automatically so you won't 
have to boot the Basics disk before you use them. Incidentally, it's only 
common courtesy to buy the blank disks you use from that dealer. 

If your dealer fails you, look to a local user group. Many user groups 
will still have the contributed volumes around. Both the instruction man- 
uals are out of print, however, and are generally unavailable, although 
you might try a user group's library. This doesn't matter at all for vol- 
umes 1 , 2, and 4 (the last two of which are only slide shows of still hi-res 
pictures anyway), whose instrurtions are displayed on the screen on 
booting. 

Many of the programs included in volumes 3 and 5 also have in- 
ternal instructions. Others simply add Applesoft features to Integer Ba- 
sic (hi-res graphics, for example), which makes them obsolete now. 

But at least one of these programs is still very useful today. It's a 
database management system — sort of a poor man's Data Factory or 
Personal Filing System. Although its limited storage capacity probably 
precludes its use without modification for business or professional appli- 
cations, it provides an excellent introdurtion to database systems. The 
program is on volume 3 under the name File Cabinet, and, since it's writ- 
ten entirely in Applesoft, you can list it for study and modification. 

Because you probably won't be able to find a copy of the instrurtion 
booklet for volumes 3 through 5, we'll go through a short tutorial here 
showing how to use File Cabinet to keep a phone list with the names sort- 
ed alphabetically and to create a sales analysis by day of the week for a 
retail store. 

After you have obtained copies of the contributed volumes, use FID 
to copy File Cabinet from volume 3 onto an initialized but otherwise 
blank disk and label the disk File Cabinet. Because the program gen- 
erates additional files, devote a separate disk to it. Now run the pro- 
gram. At the top of your screen, there should be a prompt asking for the 
name of your new database file. If so, that's fine. 

It's possible, by the way, that someone at your dealer used the pro- 
gram for a demonstration and that it already has some files on it. If it 
does, you'll see the file creation and deletion menu instead. At the bot- 
tom will be the choice, "Delete a database." Select that option by num- 
ber and then delete the old database files by number answering Y for yes 
when prompted. After deleting the last one, you'll see the familiar

prompt and be asked for the new file name. 

Now type phone list. When you're asked for a header for column 1, 
type name and for column 2 type phone number. Hit return twice to go to 
the main menu. 

Hit 3 to get into the enter mode and, when prompted, type the names 
and phone numbers of three or four people you call frequently. Enter 
their names at random, rather than in alphabetical order, and, when 
you're through, hit N for no more names and return to the menu. Type 9 
to examine the names and numbers. After returning to the menu, hit 6 
for sort and, when prompted, indicate that you want to sort by name and 
alphabetically. Save the sorted file when you're prompted again. 

The next step is to design a format for your report so that the names 
and numbers will line up neatly in columns and rows. Choose option 5, 
Report, from the main menu and answer Y for yes to indicate you want 
to create a format. The program will then tell you that your file contains 
three possible header titles for the columns: the record number (0), name 
(1), and phone number (2). When it asks how many headers you want, 
answer 2. When it asks which one should be first, select 1 for name. It'll 
then ask you for a tab, the column on the saeen at which the name col- 
umn should begin. Type 0. Then it will ask whether or not you want the 
column added up and the total printed. Since this is a list of names, type 
N for no. 

When the program asks for the second column, select 2 for phone 
number, 24 to begin printing in the twenty-fifth position on your screen, 
and N; you don't need to total the phone numbers either. You will then 
be asked to select records by header in case you don't want to display all 
columns of the list. Type return to get the entire report. You should see a 
neatly formatted phone list on your screen. 

If you have a printer, you can make a hard copy of your phone list by 
selecting 7 from the main menu to turn on the printer and selecting the 
appropriate carriage width (40, 80, or 132 columns wide) for your 
printer. Now, when you hit 5 for Report, output will go to the printer 
rather than to the screen. Unfortunately, you may have a problem. File 
Cabinet was originally written for a Centronics interface card. If you 



have a different one, you may find that line feeds are suppressed and that 
all the lines print one on top of the other. The Silentype does fine, 
though; in fact, you don't even have to turn it on, if your report tabs to 
more than forty columns. 

If you have an Epson printer, doing the following should fix the 
problem. Load File Cabinet and list lines 5260 and 5290. Unless some- 
body at your dealer or user group has already made the necessary 
change, you should see print "K80N" and print "K132N", respectively. 
What isn't evident is that ahead of each K is an invisible control-I. Un- 
fortunately Epson uses control-I followed by a K to suppress the line 
feed. To get rid of the K, type very carefully. 

5260 PRINT CHR$(9);"80N";CHR$(29) 

5290 PRINT CHR$(9);"132N" 
If you don't have an Epson or this doesn't work, ask your dealer for 
help. The fact that you can supply the offending line numbers out of this 
530-line program means it should be easy for your dealer to assist you. 

Now let's use File Cabinet as a business planning tool. Let's assume 
that you have a retail store selling widgets or whatever. When you look 
around, it seems that your employees are loafing in a half empty store on 
Mondays and Tuesdays throughout the year and on almost every day 
during the first week of each month. Perhaps you should rearrange work 
schedules so that you have more people on duty during the busy times 
and fewer people working during slack periods. Question: Given daily 
sales figures, which are the slack and which are the busy days on the av- 
erage? Although this problem's simple enough that a glance at the raw 
data would tell you, it illustrates the capabilities of the program. 

Begin by naming your database Sales Analysis. Choose as your head- 
ers -M-, -T-, -W-, -T-, -F-, and -S-. The dashes are just for 
looks, to jazz up the output. This time we'll work out the format before 
entering data. In addition to the six daily columns, we'll need a column 
for the totals. 

Let's assume that we have a retail store whose sales usually range 
from $100 to $900 a day and never exceed $9,999 for a week. We'll need 
to allow five positions per column including a blank separator space and

seven spaces for the totals. This time, after choosing option 5 from the 
main menu, select headers 1 through 6, give them tab settings of 
1,6, 1 1,16,21, and 26, respectively, and then select 33 when asked for a tab 
for the totals. 

Even though the report has no numbers, you'll be able to check the 
headers to make sure they're where they belong. Then, when prompted, 
save this format under the name Sales Report Format. Then go to enter 
mode via the main menu and enter the following numbers for Monday 
through Saturday of week 1 and then of week 2, and so on. The slash 
here ends each week for convenience: 152 105 352 245 41 1 221/ 395 1 12 
476 609 561 793/ 247 257 102 275 636 680/ 135 334 611 328 891 737. 

Again, select Report from the main menu and then select Sales Re- 
port Format. Return or shift-P will select all headers. This time your 
report will have the totals of the rows at the right. It may or may not 
have the column totals at the bottom. There was a bug in the original 
program that your dealer or user group may or may not have fixed. Let's 
see if you can spot it here in line 3130 if you know that A$ is the tab po- 
sition you chose for the horizontal total 



3130 IF LEN(A$) = 0 THEN K(0) 
3360 ON T9 GOSUB 3540 



0: T9 = 1. 



The subroutine beginning at line 3540 prints a dotted line and the col- 
umn totals, but there's no way that you'll ever see them. When you se- 
lected tab position 33 for the row totals, you set the length of A$ at some- 
thing other than zero. Everything after the if condition in line 3130 is 
ignored. The variable T9 is never set to 1, so in line 3360 the program 
fails to branch to the subroutine that prints the column totals. 

In addition, simply selecting the report option from the main menu 
runs the program past the line 

2950 T9 = 0 



so that T9 is initialized every time you select the report option. This 
means that a format whose column totals printed one time might not 
print the next even though the machine was never turned off. 



Check to make sure your program still has line 2950. If the line is still 
there, delete it. Then add the following line: 

3085 IF L$ = "Y" THEN T9 = 1 

This addition uses a bit of overkill in resetting the flag to branch to the 
subroutine that prints the column totals every time you hit Y, but it gets 
the job done. Because we deleted the initializing line 2950, which was 
doing its job too effectively, it may be necessary to rerun the entire pro- 
gram to set T9 back to zero if you don't want column totals. 

Unfortunately, the flag to print the column totals isn't saved as part 
of the format, so you'll lose it when you exit the program. Still, you won't 
have to reenter the data each time, although you might need to reenter 
the format. In addition, there seems to be a bug that'll nip you if you save 
only part of a file and then try to delete it. If, for example, you enter a 
database name and the header names but no format and then try to de- 
lete the whole thing, the program acts as if onerr— resume were on. 
When it can't find a format file name on the disk, it just keeps on spin- 
ning. If you have that problem, delete the excess files yourself. 

Note also that if you're asked something about headers or files and 
hitting return by itself doesn't work, shift-P probably will. It's the char- 
acter that File Cabinet uses to indicate "all." Also note that you can en- 
ter a minus sign in front of your data if you want the data to be sub- 
tracted. This may affect the neatness of your report, but the arithmetic 
will be correct. 

In a later issue, we'll look at ways to modify File Cabinet so that it 
will link cells mathematically somewhat in the way that VisiCalc does. 
You'll still be limited to twenty columns and 104 rows (or one column 
and 2,080 rows, and so on), and you'll have to do some reprogramming 
to change the functional relationships, but you will get some idea of the 
power offered by electronic worksheets of this sort. Since the capacity of 
this program will be so limited, perhaps VisiCorp won't object if we call 
it MicroCalc. . . . 

So long till next year.

T^he reason you bought a 

computer 

in the first place. 



The Agony... 
You 
expected 
your new computer 
to perform miracles 
— to bring order out ^ 
of cliaos. You looked \ ' 
for it to organize and 
manage your business 
information. You looked forward 
to the end of errors, the end of 
frustration . . . and the saving of 
time, effort and money. Afterall, 
that's the reason you invested in 
a computer in the first place. 
Yet, there it sits. Nothing. 

...and the ecstasy. 

Well, your computer can per- 
form all the miracles you hoped 
for. It needs just one profes- 
sional addition. The 
General Manager. 

The General Man 
agar is what the com- 
puter industry calls a 
data base management 
program (DBM). In 
everyday words — it 
allows you to organize 
store, file, find, save, re- 
treive, interrelate, control 
and print out all or selected parts 
of your information. The result: 
your information, or data, is 
managed totally, completely, 
automatically. 

Ordinary 

The ordinary DBM system 
expects your business to con- 
form to its program design. So 
you must change your records, 
your forms, your way of having 
information cross-referenced, 
saved and . . . well, you almost 
end up with a different business! 
Certainly a more frustrating one. 

Extraordinary 

The General Manager on the 
other hand is extraordinary in 
the DBM field, because it makes 
no such demands on you. In- 
stead, it lets you make demands 
on it! The General Manager was 
designed so that your business 




The General Manager 




routines can be kept as indivi- 
dualized as you want ... so your 
data is managed and de- 
livered in the ways which 
are most useful, effi- 
cient and effective 
for you. 

It works so easily 
and so well because 
of its "hierarchial" 
structure. This sen- 
sible "family tree" 
type of design starts 
with the main subject, then 
branches out to related informa- 
tion. You enter data on "Blank 
Forms" which you may construct 
to your exact needs. The data 
may be updated, deleted or 
modified to 
your heart's 
content. To 
know The 
General Man- 
ager will be to 
love it! 

Power & 
Price 

Nothing 
near the price 
of the General 
Manager (by 
hundreds of 
dollars) gives 
you all the 
power, fea- 
tures and benefits it does! At 
$229.95, The General Manager is 
the absolute value in its field. 




Consider this: it supports 1 
to 4 floppy disk drives (even 
hard-disk systems). It includes 
utility programs which others 
charge hundreds extra for. 
Upper and lower case characters 
in the data base are provided 
without need for additional 
costly hardware. If someone 
goofs, the "error message" is 
displayed in understandable 
English. There is an on- 
screen "Help" function 
available any time. It 
creates Applesoft usable 
files for your program 
needs. And many espe- 
cially useful printing 
commands are built-in 
for 

greater flexi- 
bility. When 
you consider 
all these ad- 
vantages, and 
more, we think 
your business 
sense will a- 
gree, there's 
no contest at 
any price. 

The fantasy... 

Almost 
everyone 
claims user 
friendly docu- 
mentation. The fact remains 
much of it is convoluted, com- 
plicated and defies under- 



standing. You can't afford 
that! — for a program 
without excellent 
documentation is 
j, frustrating and basi- 
cally useless. 

...and reality! 

At Sierra On-Line we've 
spent the time and the effort 
to create superb documentation. 
It is so good that you can have 
The General Manager up and 
running after the first two 
chapters! And after you're 
thoroughly at home with it, you 
can move on to the other 
chapters as you have need for 
the many additional functions 
and capabilities. 

The reason you bought... 

... a computer in the first 
place was, we know, twofold: 
for word processing (our Screen 
Writer program is the leader) . . . 
but mainly for information man- 
agement. The General Manager 
is your powerful 
answer . . . the 
truly outstand- 
ing value in 
DBM's, bar 
none, at only 
$229.95.

^Applesoft 






byDougCarlston 



Up until now we have skipped over one of the most powerful fea- 
tures of the Applesoft language — its ability to compute, to handle num- 
bers. Applesoft is just loaded with special commands designed for num- 
ber crunching; perhaps we have avoided them so long only to prove the 
point that computers can do much more than mere math. 

So this month we'll tackle a variety of math function commands and 
try to think of some amusing and bizarre things to do with them. Here 
are the new Applesoft commands for the month; 



COS(X) 


SQR(X) 


SIN(X) 


SPC(X) 


DEFFN(X) 


TAN(X) 


ATN(X) 





First, though, let's take a quick look at last month's homework as- 
signment: to design a routine that creates random but pronounceable 
names. The easiest way to do this is to create two strings, one full of 
vowels and the other filled with consonants. Then pick random elements 
out of each, going back and forth from one to the other until you have 
your name. Here's one of many solutions: 



10 CNSNT$ = "BCDFGHJKLMNPRSTVWXZ" :VOWELS$ = 
"AEIOUY" 

15 INVERSE : PRINT "PASSENGER LIST": NORMAL : PRINT 
20 FOR X = 1 TO 2 + RND (1) * 4 

30 NAMES = NAMES + MID$ (CNSNT$, RND (1) * LEN (CNSNT$) + 

1,1) + MID$ (VOWELSS, RND (1) * LEN (VOWELSS) + 1,1) 
40 NEXT 

50 ON RND (1) * 3 + 1 GOTO 60,70,80 
60 PRINT "MR. ";NAME$: GOTO 100 
70 PRINT "MRS. ";NAME$: GOTO 100 
80 PRINT "MS. ";NAME$ 

100 NAMES = " ":K = K + 1: IF K < 21 THEN 20 
110 GOTO 110 



The only tricky part is line 30, which does all of the work. The MID$ 
commands only look complicated because of the second parameter in 
them, which says (basically), "Find out the length of the string and then 
pick a random number between zero and that length. Then add one to it 
and this will indicate which character we will pick from the string." (You 
have to add one because otherwise you might find yourself trying to pick 
the "zeroth" character, which won't do — all words start with the first 
character.) 

If you wanted to stress some consonants over others, you could just 
add them into the string CNSNTS more often. 

Now let's leave behind word mangling and direct some abuse at com- 
puter math. Those who remember any math from school have a great 
advantage over the author, who has learned what little math he knows 
from his Apple. Many of these routines will, therefore, seem absurdly 
simple-minded to the true math aficionado. Nevertheless, we will 
persevere. 

Everybody knows how to do the four basic math operations on the 
Apple by now, although some of us may still be tempted at times to use 
the X instead of the asterisk for multiply. If you want to take a power of 



a number, you can't write a superscript, so you'll have to use the upward 
caret that you get by typing shift-N. 

3^ becomes 3 A 2 

To take the square root of a number you can use a built-in function of 
Applesoft: 

VTbecomes S0R(2) 

Here is a quick httle program that prints out a table of squares and 
square roots: 

10 FOR X = 1 TO 10 
20 PRINT X,X A 2,S0R(X) 
30 NEXT 

This sort of thing is much more fun in hi-res graphics, however, so 
here's how we'd plot squares to the screen: 

10 HGR : POKE 49234,0 
20 FOR X = 1 TO 279 

30 Y = ((X - 140) / 10) A 2 + 96:Y1 = 192 - Y 
40 IF Y < 0 OR Y > 192 THEN 100 
50 HCOLOR= 1: HPLOT X,Y 
60 HCOLOR= 2: HPLOT X,Y1 
100 NEXT 

Look at line 30 for a minute. Basically, all we are doing is squaring 
the value of X and setting Y equal to that. However, we have to make 
some adjustments in order to get the range of numbers to plot on the 
screen. By subtracting 140 from X we get a range from - 140 to -I- 140 in- 
stead of from 0 to 280. This gives us both sides of the curve. We divided 
this value by ten before we squared it because otherwise most of the 
values of Y would be so big that they wouldn't plot on the screen (after 
all, remember that the screen has only 192 rows, so Y has to stay within 
the 0 to 191 range). 

We added 96 (which is exactly half the number of rows on the screen) 
in order to shift the curve downward so that we could plot the inverse 
curve (in a different color) right above it. This made it more aesthetically 
appealing, we thought. Opinions on this may differ. 

Notice the test we put in line 40. Without this test the program won't 
work at all, since illegal values of Y will immediately appear (X can't be- 
come an illegal value since it is controlled by the for-next loop and runs 
from 1 to 279). 

Now let's try out our brains a little. See if you can use the SQR func- 
tion, along with the INT function, to write a program that prints out all 
of the prime numbers up to 1,000. Prime numbers, you may recall, are 
those numbers that can be divided evenly only by one and themselves. 
The first six prime numbers are 1 , 2, 3, 5, 7, and 1 1 . 

Here are a couple of things you might keep in mind that will make 
your program run faster. First of all, if you have tried dividing a number 
by everything up to its square root without success, you can stop. Noth- 
ing larger than the square root will divide evenly unless something small- 
er than the square root does too. And second, if you have tried dividing 



264 



SOTTAI 1/ 



DECEMBER 1982 



by two and failed, it is not necessary to try dividing by any other even 
numbers, as they will also fail. 

Okay. Read no further until you have written your program. If it 
works, you win — it doesn't have to look anything like the program that 
follows. If you just can't make it function, here is one solution: 

5 PRINT 1;SPC(3);2;SPC(3);3;SPC(3); 

10 FOR X = 5 TO 1000 STEP 2 

20 FOR Y = 3 TO SOR (X) STEP 2 

30 IF X / Y = INT (X / Y) THEN Y = SQR (X):FLAG = 1 

40 NEXT Y 

50 IF NOT FLAG THEN PRINT X; SPC(3); 
60 FLAG = 0 
70 NEXT X 

Line 5 is what is known in the trade as "cheating" — it prints out the 
first three primes since the routine doesn't work on primes less than five. 
The command SPC(X) is just a simple way of inserting spaces between 
the numbers being printed; otherwise, they would all run together and be 
very hard to read. 

Applesoft has loads of other functions built in. Some of the most use- 
ful are the trig functions — they are invaluable for calculating and plot- 
ting curves. Here are the (very logical) names of the four functions: 



SIN(X) 
COS(X) 
TAN(X) 
ATN(X) 



Sine 
Cosine 
Tangent 
Arctangent 



The value of X is expressed in radians, not degrees. (For those who 
almost remember what a radian is, it's the length of the radius of a cir- 
cle — if you measure the circumference of the circle, you always come out 
with approximately 6.28, or 2 pi, radians.) If you don't know any trigo- 
nometry, you aren't likely to get much mileage out of these. However,

here is a simple little plotting program that shows graphically what the 

four functions are like: 

10 HGR : POKE 49234,0 

20 FOR X = 1 TO 279 

30 Y = SIN (X / 30) * 50 + 96 

40 Z = COS (X / 30) * 50 + 96 

50 T = TAN (X / 30) * 50 + 96 

60 A = ATN (X / 30) * 50 + 96 

80 HCOLOR= 1: HPLOTX.Y: HCOLOR= 2: HPLOTX.Z: HCOLOR = 

5: IF T > 0 AND T < 192 THEN HPLOT X,T 
90 HCOLOR= 6: IF A > 0 AND A < 192 THEN HPLOT X,A 
100 NEXT 

Now try one on your own. Let's see you draw a perfect circle on the 
screen. After you have given it a crack, take a look at the following list- 
ing. This little loop will draw a circle on the screen. Depending on your 
television, the circle may look more like an oval. Try to modify the pro- 
gram to make the circle perfectly round. 

10 HGR : HCOLOR = 3: POKE 49234,0 

20 FOR R = - 3.14159 TO 3.14159 STEP .05 

30 X = COS (R) * 40 + 140 

40 Y = SIN (R) * 40 + 96 

50 HPLOT X,Y 

60 NEXT R 

In this example, the circle has its center at 140,96 and has a 
radius of 40. 

The last set of Applesoft commands we are going to play with this 
month are the Junction and define fimction commands. A function is a lit- 
tle bit like a subroutine; once you have defined it, you can refer to it from 
anywhere in the program, using the same code over and over. However, 
while a subroutine can be a whole miniprogram in itself, containing 
dozens of instructions, a function can only consist of a single instruction. 

A function is defined, usually at the beginning of a program, using 
the DEF FN command. For example, here is how we define a function 
that gives us only the fractional part of a number (we'll call the function 
RMDR, short for remainder): 

DEF FN RMDR(X) = X - INT (X) 

Here is how you would use it in a program 

10 DEF FN RMDR (X) = X - INT (X) 
20 FOR A = 1 TO 50 
30 Y = SOR (A) 

40 PRINT INT (Y);" ";FN RMDR (Y) 
50 NEXT A 

You can even use functions inside of functions. Try this: 

10 DEF FN A(A) = INT (SQR(A)) 

30 FOR X = 10 TO 1000000 STEP 300 

40 PRINT X;" ";FN A(X);" ";FN A(FN A(X)) 

50 NEXT X 

Now try this. Go back to the routine you wrote to draw a circle and 
use DEF FTV to define the values of both X and Y. Then compare it with 
this last example: 

10 HGR2:HCOLOR = 3 
20 DEF FN A(X) = COS (X) * 40 + 140 
30 DEF FN B(X) = SIN (X) * 40 + 96 
. 40 FOR R = - 3.14159 TO 3.14159 STEP .05 
50 X = FN A(R):Y = FN B(R) 
60 HPLOT X,Y 
70 NEXT R 

That's about it for this month. Have a happy holiday. Next month 
we will begin to talk about saving and retrieving data files, and we'll start 
designing our own file management system.

□ Christmas in August? American Express 
likes to do nice things for their customers. 
When innovative new ideas surface, this com- 
pany tries to give customers a preview glimpse. 
In May, they were the first to have the Sinclair 
handheld computer. Late this summer Amer- 
ican Express mailed to cardholders what are 
best described as "electronic greeting cards." 




as "These Are a Few of My Favorite Things" 
and "Let Me Call You Sweetheart." 

According to a recent Los Angeles Times arti- 
cle. Hallmark Cards Inc. has also been exam- 
ining the potential of microcomputer-aided 
greeting cards. Meanwhile, American Express is 
now looking at other possible marketing ap- 
plications for microchip technology. The next 



MUSICAL TU'<;F HA 




An electronic greeting card looks like any 
other greeting card at first. It's only when you 
open it that the difference becomes apparent. 
The card offered by American Express plays a 
two-song medley of "We Wish You a Merry 
Christmas" and "Silent Night." 

Utilizing a CMOS-LSI chip, a button-sized 
battery, and piezo-electric transducer for a 
speaker, this new breed of greeting card is a 
logical follow-up to watches and calculators 
that play musical tones. A simple contact switch 
causes the music to play when you open the 
card. Closing the card sets the program back to 
the beginning. The eighth-inch thick battery 
provides up to eight hours of continuous play. 

Stan Krangel, a merchant in American Ex- 
press's New York office, says the cards have 
been very successful and have generated a lot of 
interest among those lucky enough to see one. 
"We figured that people were going to be real 
curious about how the cards worked. So we de- 
cided to include a brief missive explaining how 
they function." 

At this time only customers of American 
Express can get these musical cards, though that 
will change in the future. 

American Greetings is currently working on 
a whole line of electronic greeting cards that 
should be appearing sometime this spring. 
Twelve different cards are on the docket, includ- 
ing six that play "Happy Birthday." There will 
also be five friendship cards that play such tunes 



innovation may be talking cards that electron- 
ically whisper words of endearment to your 
loved one. 

□ "And on That Farm He Had a Computer." 

Old MacDonald has entered the information 
age. Although personal and portable comput- 
ers have been part of farming for years, their 
presence is just now being felt on a large scale. 
No manufacturer is going after this new, fertile 
market with more gusto than Tandy, pur- 
veyors of the TRS-80 and owners of the suc- 
cessful Radio Shack chain of electronic stores. 

All farms, no matter how small, are busi- 
nesses, and it has long been predicted that com- 
puters would have a significant impact on pro- 
ductivity and information management once 
farmers warmed up to the idea. With the state 
of the economy the way it is, farmers are being 
pushed harder than ever to adapt better means 
of production and more competitive selling 
techniques. Up-to-the-minute information 
about production costs and market prices is es- 
sential to the modern farmer's survival. Tradi- 
tional methods have proven to be slow and fre- 
quently unreliable. The promise of instanta- 
neous information waiting at their fingertips has 
spurred quite a bit of interest among farmers 
and software publishers, as well as among hard- 
ware manufacturers. 

Tandy has an agreement with Raintree Pub- 
lications in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to sell a 
videotex system for farmers, called AgriStar, in

the thousands of Radio Shack stores across the 
country. Raintree's Richard Weening, the aea- 
tor of AgriStar, said in a recent article pub- 
lished in Barron's: "Farmers know how to pro- 
duce, but not how to sell." 

AgriStar's main feature is a twelve thou- 
sand-page database that includes everything 
from crop prices to commodity analysts' re- 
ports, provided by the Commodity News Serv- 
ice. Up-to-the-minute weather information is 
provided by NASA. Also available are a shop- 
ping service, an electronic mail service, and an 
on-line computing farm management program. 
Of course, you need a computer to take advan- 
tage of all these nifty features. 

When a farmer goes to a Radio Shack, he 
has an option. He can buy one of Tandy's com- 
puters to run AgriStar or he can lease a dumb 
terminal for less than four hundred dollars a 
year. A dumb terminal is only capable of receiv- 
ing information and is incapable of actual com- 
puting functions. Needless to say, Tandy is hop- 
ing to sell a few more machines because of Agri- 
Star. 

One potential problem that's already been 
noted about AgriStar is its poor graphics capa- 
bilities. Utilizing Prestel, a cost-effective British 
system for transmitting data, AgriStar will be 
short on visual presentation of information. Ac- 
cording to the Barron's article. Weening is not 
convinced that graphics are all that important. 
He contends that farmers are more interested in 
hard facts than in how a healthy com aop 
looks. 

AgriStar joins the ranks of other ambitious 
videotex projects such as Canada's Grassroots, 
which supplies market information from Win- 
nepeg's commodities exchange. Seeing the po- 
tential benefit in this kind of system, the Cana- 
dian business community is doing its part to cut 
costs for Grassroots. The Royal Bank of Can- 
ada sponsors Grassroots weather reports. 

In the meantime, the Bakersfield Califor- 
nian, a rural newspaper, is embarking on an am- 
bitious videotex system for farmers in the San 
Joaquin Valley. 

CompuServe has also announced the avail- 
ability of Farm News Express. Founded by 
Leonard Timm, a former reporter for the 
United States Department of Agriculture's daily 
Market News, FNE claims to be the largest 
database of produce information in the coun- 
try. Using CompuServe's computer network, 
FNE distributes information about nineteen 
city produce markets and thirty growing-area 
produce markets. 

According to Timm, the FNE videotex serv- 
ice is a faster and cheaper way to obtain daily 
market reports than the USDA's printed Mar- 
ket News, which is sent through the regular 
mail. Timm plans to expand the service to in- 
clude city and growing-area markets for poul- 
try, grain, and livestock. FNE already includes 
electronic mail and bulletin board access to en- 
able subscribers to communicate among them- 
selves. 

With farm management software pouring 
into the market and with videotex systems be- 
coming commonplace, farmers now have sev- 



eral ways to seek computer aid in these troubled 
times. "A computer here and a computer 
there. . . ." 

□ Ready, Aim, Ignite! Suppose you're a nurse 
who works nights on the sixth floor of a hos- 
pital. It's dangerous at night on the street where 
your car is parked. It's also cold out there. 

So when you're about ready to leave, you 
pull out a transmitter, as small as a pack of 
cigarettes, with a seven-inch antenna. Aiming 
the transmitter through a window in the direc- 
tion of your car, you push a button. The motor 
starts, the heater turns on, and then the head- 
lights come to life. Five minutes later you exit 
the hospital, get in the warmed-up car, and 
drive away in comfort. 

Except that by the time you get to your car, 
a crowd has gatherered and wants to know 
where you got the gizmo that made the car start 
unattended. 

The little black box is caDed Tran^tart, and 
it's part of a system made by TransStart of 
Provo, Utah. It retails for less than $400. For an 
additional $100 you can have the whole kit pro- 
fessionally installed. 

The entire system consists of the trans- 
mitter, a two-by-four-by-six-inch receiver that- 
attaches under the dash of your car, and sole- 
noids that attach to the starter and any other 
electrical device you want turned on automati- 
cally. To prevent the device from affecting 
your neighbor's car, if it also happens to have 
TransStart installed, each system has a per- 
sonal frequency code that programs one 
system only. 

When you push the button on the trans- 
mitter, the microcomputer in the receiver under 
the dash activates the starter, sends back a mes- 
sage that it has started, then kicks out eight sec- 
onds later. It lets the car run eight minutes be- 
fore turning it off unless it receives further in- 
structions. That way, in case you are delayed in 
leaving, you don't waste gas while your car sits 
idling without a driver. 

The mind of man always seems to be racing 
ahead of what technology can actually do. In 
the case of Gene Thall, coinventor of Trans- 
Start, the idea had a twenty-year lead on its 
realization. 

Back in 1958, Thall thought there's got to be 
a better way to start your car than running out 
to it, getting in, and starting it cold, especially 
on winter mornings. 

"I was born and raised in Wyoming, and it 
gets awfully cold there," he says. "Sometimes it'll 
reach thirty below and stay there for six weeks." 

So Thall and his son, Steve, began to for- 
mulate a system to start a car by remote con- 
trol back when a gallon of gas cost less than a 
copy of a big city newspaper does today. 

"The theory was strong, but we had to 
make it work," says Thall. The idea was even- 
tually knocked out of their minds: no suitable 
technology existed at the time. 

The notion remained parked in the back of 
the tinkerers' minds for twenty years, until 1978, 
the year the proper chips and diodes reached the 
marketplace. Thall and son hauled out their 
sketches and brought their starter into the

National is not, however, a computer retailer in 
the normal sense. Employees who wish to buy a 
machine must complete a form stating the use 
to which they intend to put it and why they need 
to take it from the center. In this way, Syn- 
nott's information division keeps tabs on who's 
got what and why. It's like registering a gun. 
The company knows you have it, and if some- 
thing bad happens they know where to start

proval. If they want to access a corporate data- 
base, we refer them to the purveyors of that 
database and to the bank's security officer for 
approval." 

Training at the personal computer center is 
provided by the information systems staff, who 
work the center on a rotating basis. Full-time 
staffers alternate with half-day volunteers as 
consultants. The most popular computer at 
First National is the Apple ("it has the most 
software"), followed by the IBM Personal 
Computer ("coming on strong"), with the TRS- 
80 in third place. 

The center has a software library, which 
Synnott encourages employees to add to. 

"If people in the bank develop software that 
we think has universal appeal, we will include it 
in the library after testing. One employee is cur- 
rently developing a 'Monte Carlo' simulation 
program to analyze oil and real estate invest- 
ments. Most programs developed are of the 
VisiCalc variety, from telestaffing models to 
asset liability management, financial analysis, 
loan analysis, portfolio management, tax plan- 
ning, stock performance, and statistical 
modeling. 

"We just teach them how to use the ma- 
chines and give them some training in VisiCalc, 
but we don't write their programs. This is a do- 
it-yourself business." 

□ CompuScam. The personal computing 
world, though still young, innocent, and excit- 
able, is subject to all the thousand shocks that 
flesh is heir to. As yet, it still counts first-time 
users and very young people, rather than sea- 
soned business users, among the greater por- 
tion of its population. All the openness and 
enthusiasm that characterizes this world makes 
it particulariy vulnerable to the speculation of 
less-than-scrupulous individuals.

The Demon^s Forge 

By Brian Fargo 

"Death to him, your majesty! He killed four of your guards in a tavern brawl!" 

The king stands, peering down at your bruised and battered form. You meet his 
eyes, snarling in defiance and trying to break free from the grip of heavy chains and 
manacles. The monarch laughs at your efforts. 

"You are a renowned gladiator," he says, "and have fought often in my pay. For 
these past services I give you your life — but to prove your worthiness for free- 
dom, you need find an exit from the Demon's Forge. Guards, remove him!" 

You reason that you may as well have been executed. The Demon's 
Forge, an infamous dungeon network, has an exit as well as an 
entrance, but no one in past centuries has escaped alive. 

You laugh bitterly, planning revenge as they cast you 
within, with nothing to aid you save a package of rations. 
Perhaps you will surprise them yet. . .

your door, or comes to your office. He's a busi- 
nessman with a problem. He says he's just pur- 
chased a quantity of Apples /IBMs / 
modems/printers/disk drives. His clients have 
put down a 50 percent deposit, but now they 
can't come up with the rest and he's stuck. If 
you move fast, you can take a lot of valuable 
equipment off his hands at half price. Just give 
him $1,200 to $1 ,800 per batch of five units, and 
he'll use it to pay off his distributor, saving two 
or three machines for you. 

You do so. After some time has elapsed, 
you give him a call. There's been a delay; the 
items were misrouted. More time passes. Now 
the man reveals that the manufacturer is check- 
ing to see if the equipment is stolen goods. 
Months go by. And suddenly your entrepre- 
neurial partner is nowhere to be found. 

This may have happened to you, or it may 
in the future. And the man's name may be Wil- 
li liam Bozarth. 

Bozarth faces charges of felony grand theft 
! and falsely representing an Apple dealer in the 
' California counties of Santa Cruz, Solano, 
Marin, Concord, and Monterey. His case has 
produced so many jurisdictional problems that 
the five counties are considering turning the 
I matter over to the California state attorney gen- 
i eral's office. If you have any information about 
Mr. Bozarth, contact the district attorney's of- 
fice of these counties. 

The ability of the native American bunco 
artist — the gentleman who once sold deeds for 
the Brooklyn Bridge to arriving immigrants — to 
adapt to sophisticated technology is a matter of 
record. In the recent case of the fictitious Ari- 
zona World Enterprises company, the individ- 
ual responsible was finally caught, tried, and 
convicted. He subsequently moved to a neigh- 
boring city and pulled the scam again. 

The advent of the computer age has failed to 
render obsolete the oldest tenet of business: 
caveat emptor — let the buyer beware. 
□ DODDS Ataris. The Atari home com- 
puter has been chosen for exclusive use by the 
Department of Defense Dependent Schools 
(DODDS). Approximately fourteen hundred 
Atari 800s have been ordered for educating de- 
pendents of United States military and civilian 
personnel stationed overseas. 

The Atari "came out on top technically over 
all the others in a competitive bid," according to 
Dennis L. Bybee, educational computing coor- 
dinator with DODDS. Bybee was not able to 
reveal the names of the other microcomputers 
involved. 

Thomas M. McDonnough, senior vice pres- 
ident of sales and marketing for Atari's home 
computer, remarked, "It is gratifying to us to 
know that this contract award was made after 
thorough evaluafion of competing computer 
systems on the basis of available application 
software, hardware, systems software, docu- 
mentation, maintenance, and personnel train- 
ing." 

The Ataris will be used in the DODDS pro- 
grams in computer literacy, computer-aided in- 
struction, computer science, and also in admin- 
istrative support for the schools. Each system 



SOFTAI K 




will include an Atari 800 (with 48K), disk drive, 
interface module, eighty column printer, and 
color monitor. Atari will provide training for 
DODDS personnel. 

"We were looking for a machine that would 
help us teach kids about computers with com- 
puters," Bybee explains. "The Atari had sev- 
eral attractive key features: sound, color graph- 
ics, and durability. It has Basic and Pascal for 
our secondary schools and Pilot, with turtle 
graphics, for our elementary schools. 

"To pass our college entrance placement 
test, students must test out on a computer lan- 
guage. We prefer Pascal, with its structured pro- 
gram logic." 



273 

The only drawback the DODDS found with 
the Atari was its lack of instructional software, 
notes Bybee. "More schools in the U.S. are 
adopting the Atari, and we're looking forward 
to more major educational publishing compa- 
nies getting involved. We have received a posi- 
dve reaction from a large variety of vendors 
about this." 

DODDS manages 272 schools located in 
twenty-four countries around the worid, with 
an enrollment of around one hundred forty 
thousand students. Bybee says the DODDS ex- 
pects to have at least twelve hundred Ataris up 
and running by September of next year, after a 
year of installation and training. 31 



ASSEMBLER/TEACHER 



This program makes your APPLE* teach you assembler! We 
assume you know BASIC already, and now you'd like to learn 
APPLE* assembler. You need three things [two heavies and a 
friend] . , . 

1 . The APPLE II Reference Manual (heavy], 

2, A good 6502 assembler manual (another heavy: ask for both 
at your APPLE* dealer], and 

3^ ASSEMBLER TEACHER, a friendly program thattakes you 
right through the learning barrier! 

ASSEMBLER TEACHER will soon have you eating those manuals for 
breakfast. And you'll never outgrow ASSEMBLER TEACHER, since it 
has tools an expert can use even more than a novice. Here's how 
ASSEMBLER TEACHER works: 



• ASSEMBLER TEACHER prowls your APPLE'S memory page by 
page, drawing a map of what it finds^ 

•ASSEMBLER TEACHER shows your CPU running in slow motion on 
your screen, so you can see exactly what the operations are 
doing to the registers and the stack (a great debugging tool], 

•ASSEMBLER TEACHER exposes the mysteries of hexadecimal, 
two's complement, character and other data representa- 
tions, instantly translating from any version to all others. 

•ASSEMBLER TEACHER gives you the concepts you need to 
cope with assembler, using simple on-line lessons that grab 
you by the keyboard and make you play your way to 
knowledge, 

•ASSEMBLER TEACHER is written by John Fairfield, 
a Ph.D. in Computer Science who regularly 
teaches assembler, A RAM 
Mini-Assembler is included.

Despite its "old age," the Apple is still one of the best selling com- 
puters. The amount of software and hardware that has been developed 
for this machine is truly amazing. And the list grows longer every day. 

Over the past eleven months, this column has covered quite a lot of 
the hardware side of the Apple II. Along the way, we've looked at many 
of the peripherals available for your computer. But on this account, we 
have seen only the tip of the iceberg. 

If you were to line up all of the peripheral boards available for the 
Apple, you'd need more than fifty computers just to have enough slots to 
put those devices in. With this kind of support, it's no wonder that many 
people have reached, or are about to reach, the limit of their eight-slot 
Apple. 

As the slots fill up, the operating temperature inside the Apple also 
increases. This can cause the computer to start doing "funny things." It 
may only be a matter of time before you need a fan to ensure reliable 
operation of your machine. If you're concerned with the monitoring of 
temperature for lab work, industrial control, and so on, you might also 
be interested in a dual thermometer board for the Apple. And, after you 
have your Apple running cool, we'll take a look at ways of adding a 
ninth peripheral board. 

Keeping Your Cool. The subject of fans for the Apple has created 
quite a controversy among Apple "experts." Such topics as heat flow, 
"scrubbing action," forced air versus exhaust, inside mounting versus 
external, and so on dominate the usual discussion. But we'll avoid 
getting into all the technical details, taking instead a logical approach to 
selecting a fan. 

The first question to ask is, "Do I really need a fan?" This question is a 
fairly simple one to answer, and the way to begin is by studying the reli- 
ability of your computer. If you've had the computer for a reasonable 
amount of time and have never seen it do something crazy, then you defi- 
nitely do not need a fan. (What you do need is a ticket to Las Vegas, 
which is where someone with your luck should be.) 

When something goes wrong, the first thing to determine is whether 
the problem is a software bug or a true hardware malfunction. This is not 
always obvious, but here are a few clues worth knowing. A problem that 
occurs at the same point within a program or in response to keyboard 
input is probably a software bug. Problems that occur at random times, 
or only after the computer has been on for a while, or only since you 
added that new peripheral card, point toward some sort of hardware 
failure. 

Hardware problems tend to fall into three categories: outright 
failures, mechanical intermittents, and thermal sensitivity. An outright 
failure is the easiest kind of problem to diagnose since the difficulty can 
be observed and traced using standard servicing techniques. When your 
paddles stop working (see October 1982 Hardtalk) or the video screen 
goes completely blank, it's a good bet that some part of the hardware has 
"gone south." 

Mechanical intermittents are probably the hardest kind of problem to 
track down because they usually don't happen often enough to isolate 
the problem area. Typically, the problem surfaces every few days, with 
the computer operating flawlessly in between. Mechanical intermittents 
tend to show up in two areas in the Apple. These areas are the pe- 



ripheral connectors and the IC sockets found on the motherboard. With- 
out getting into a complete diagnosis procedure for ailing Apples, suffice 
it to say that most intermittent problems are solved by reseating the pe- 
ripheral boards or sometimes by reseating one or more ICs on the moth- 
erboard. If a problem comes or goes when you gently bang on the com- 
puter or wiggle any of the cables attached to it, then it's time to look for 
mechanical intermittents. 

Thermal sensitivity usually means that the computer operates 
perfectly when it is first turned on. After a while, the temperature inside 
the computer goes up as a result of the heat generated by the various 
electronic components. Depending on other factors, such as the room 
temperature, most thermal problems show up after the computer has 
been on at least twenty minutes. The quickest way to determine if you 
have a heat problem is to remove the Apple's cover and let the computer 
cool down for a few minutes. When the computer consistently malfunc- 
tions more often with the top on than off, you've got a thermal problem. 

\%ien you're testing to see whether your machine has a thermal 
problem, waiting for the Apple to heat up before it "konks out" can be 
quite tedious. Therefore, for the purposes of verifying a suspect thermal 
problem, you can try covering the computer with a heavy towel or 
blanket (yes, cover the air vents on each side). This will cause the tem- 
perature inside the computer rapidly to exceed its normal value. This 
"worst case" test will show up any heat-related problems you may have. 
If the computer continues to operate normally after ten to fifteen 
minutes, look for other explanations for your intermittent problems. 

By the way, some mechanical intermittents and internal IC failures 
are also sensitive to increased temperature. For example, you may have 
one IC that works fine at room temperature but begins to fail as the 
Apple warms up. This may really be the fault of the IC, but in lieu of 
tracking down the exact chip, adding a fan to reduce the temperature rise 
may be a simpler solution. 

There is no question that the number one cause of overheating is 
adding peripheral cards. But even when you finally fill up that last empty 
slot and the computer begins to act up, you shouldn't automatically 
assume it is a heat problem. Other factors to consider are power supply 
drain and bus loading. These are also directly related to the number and 
type of boards that are in your machine. 

If you have information on the power requirements for each of your 
peripheral cards, you can determine if insufficient power is a potential 
problem. Here's how to go about it. First, add up the currents for all of 
the boards on each of the Apple's four supplies. Next, add in the power 
consumed by the motherboard. These figures can be found on page 104 
of the Apple II Reference Manual. Then check your totals against the 
power supply's capacity as given on page 92 of the manual. These figures 
are quite conservative, however; if your boards are drawing consider- 
ably more than the maximum on any one of the supply voltages, you 
should consider getting a heftier power supply such as the Sup'R 
Switcher from M & R Enterprises. This unit sits outside the Apple and is 
very easy to install. All that's required is that you disconnect the Apple's 
power supply and plug in the cord from the Sup'R Switcher in its place. 
This arrangement should be sufficient to power any combination of 
boards within your computer.

Data and address bus loading can also become a problem as your 
Apple fills up. Each of the signal lines in these buses is designed to feed a 
limited number of other circuits. If too many other devices are con- 
nected directly to these lines, the important signals they carry can get dis- 
torted, causing erratic, if not total, malfunctions. Older revision Apples 
are especially prone to this problem. 

Many peripheral boards incorporate "buffer" ICs to minimize the 
load on the data bus. These ICs also increase the drive capability when 
the peripheral board is "talking" on the bus. Similar specifications for 
bus loading are given in the reference manual. Unless you are fluent at 
reading schematics and IC data books, however, it may be quite hard to 
determine the exact loading/ drive characteristics of any given board. The 
only cure for bus problems, aside from trading in an old motherboard 
for a newer revision, is to use different peripherals. 

But before you buy new peripherals or trade in your motherboard, 
you should get your Apple — especially the address and data bus driver 
ICs on the motherboard — checked, so you can be sure that it is not at 
fault. 

When it comes to heat problems, peripheral boards pose a triple 
threat. First, they generate some amount of heat that gets added to the 
heat that's created by the Apple itself. Since most boards draw power 
from the Apple's power supply, they also cause it to run hotter, further 
increasing the temperature inside the Apple. Finally, to add insult to 
injury, each peripheral board acts as a barricade to convective air flow, 
causing the hot air to stagnate to an even greater extent within the 
computer. 

If, after ruling out all the other causes for intermittent failures, you 
feel the problem is heat-related, you should consider adding a fan to your 
computer. Even if you don't have a heat problem, there are several good 
reasons for adding a fan. One is that having a fan will certainly add to the 
overall reliability and life expectancy of your computer. Another reason 
is that several fans are available that also add other conveniences, such as 
switched outlets and surge protection. The Super Fan II from RH Elec- 
tronics and System Saver from Kensington Microware are two exam- 
ples of fans that provide additional conveniences of this sort. 

In or Out? Once you decide to add a fan to your computer, the next 
choice you must make is whether to mount the fan inside or outside. As 
you mull over this decision, consider whether the fan will be used to blow 
air into the computer or to exhaust air out from it. Both mounting 
methods and air flow designs have a lot of pros and cons associated with 
them. As we agreed earlier, let's avoid conflict as to which scheme may 
be technically superior. The reason for sidestepping this discussion is 
quite simple — in all but the rarest of cases, it proves irrelevant. 

Even when an Apple is loaded, the need for a fan is usually quite 
marginal; that is, the heat build-up within the computer can be signif- 
icantly reduced by the slightest movement of air. Thus, almost any fan 
will suffice to eliminate heat-related malfunctions. 

Therefore, let your fan selection be dominated by several other 
"convenience" factors. For example, internally mounted fans are less 
obtrusive, quieter, and less expensive. The disadvantages to internally 
mounted fans are having another AC cord to contend with and the possi- 
bility that an existing device, such as a modulator, will have to be re- 
located. External fans offer simple installation and usually include a new 
power switch and one or more switched outlets. Their main disadvan- 
tage is that they cannot be used with some of the monitor and disk 
stands for the Apple that are so popular. If you don't plan on using one 
of these stands, and if you can use such added features as extra outlets 
and surge protection, then an external fan is probably the better choice. 

As you may have noticed, we've placed the least importance on 
whether the fan blows in or out. This is partly because your decision on 
fan placement usually dictates the air flow design. Almost all internal 
fans blow cool air into and across the motherboard. External fans draw 
the hot air across and out of the computer. Since internal fans tend to be 
mounted on the right side and external fans on the left, the direction of 
air flow is essentially the same. 

Another significant difference in the two kinds of systems concerns 
the way air is drawn into the computer. With the external fan, cool air 
enters through the slots on the right side, back, and bottom of the com- 
puter. This allows the air to enter slowly and smoothly from several large 



areas. In the case of the internal fan, the air intake is directly next to the 
fan. This creates a greater amount of suction just to the right of the com- 
puter, increasing the amount of dust and dirt that can get blown into the 
machine. This shouldn't cause any great concern, but it can lead to other 
problems. 

A good example of an internally mounted fan is the Cool-Mark II 
from Mark Four Imports. This unit comes complete with double-sided 
foam adhesive and sells for $34.95. Do-it-yourselfers will find a real value 
in the Pee Wee Boxer Fan from Jameco Electronics. It is just the right 
size for the Apple and sells for only $12.95. 

The Super Fan II (RH Electronics) and the System Saver (Kensing- 
ton Microware) are excellent choices for external fans. Both products 
feature Apple-compatible color and styling, quiet operation, lighted 
power switch with two external outlets, and transient voltage suppres- 
sion (optional on the Super Fan II). 

Installation of either of these fans is extremely simple. First, you slide 
the unit onto the left side of the computer. Two hangers fit into the air 
vent slots to support the fan and make a tight seal. Then you remove the 
power cord that plugs into your Apple's power supply. You can put this 
cord away; as long as you have the fan connected, this cord is no longer 
needed. It is replaced by a short cable that exits from the back of the fan 
and then plugs into the Apple. The two extra outlets can then be used to 
power your monitor, printer, or whatever. The lighted switch on the 
front of the fan will then control your entire system. The final feature, 
transient protection, is another plus you can add to increase the reliabil- 
ity of your computer. This just reduces the possibility of a computer 
"crash" due to voltage spikes, which are often present on the power lines. 

The Super Fan II sells for $109 ($74.95 without transient suppres- 
sor). The System Saver is priced at $89.95. 

Fans and Stands. Several integrated monitor/disk stands with fans 
are also available. These combine the cooling function of a fan with the 
convenience of a complete center for your entire system. Two examples 
of such products are the Cool Stack from FMJ and the Apple Center 
from Doss Industries. These are priced at $69.95 and $249.95, respec- 
tively. The Apple Center also includes a key locking on-off switch, three 
convenience outlets, and a transient suppressor. 

Tovatech Ventop. At the other end of the scale, there is an elegantly 
simple, passive solution to the heat build-up problem. This is the Ventop 
from Tovatech. The Ventop is nothing more than a replacement cover 
for the Apple. It is made of metal and has a generous number of air slots 
cut into it. Although the Ventop doesn't cool the computer as well as a 
fan will, it does an impressive job without the expense, noise, and hassle 
of adding a fan. 

On the average, it appears that the Ventop reduces temperature rise 
within the computer about one-half as effectively as a fan. Of course, for 
this device to be of any use, you must not overload the top of the Apple 
or cover the vents with papers, disk drives, and so on. The Ventop retails 
for $45. 

Strawberry Tree Dual Thermometer. While we're on the subject of 
temperature, there's an excellent peripheral board available for the Apple 
that allows the computer to monitor temperatures. It is the Dual Ther- 
mometer from Strawberry Tree Computers. 

As its name implies, this unit supplies two independent temperature 
sensors that can be read by the computer. Each sensor is actually a tiny 
thermistor probe connected to the peripheral cards by a ten-foot cord. 
The probe cable can also be extended up to five hundred feet with no loss 
in accuracy. The thermometers have a useful temperature range of —55 
to -1-125 degrees C (-67 to 257 degrees F). Within the range of -20 to 
50 degrees C (-4 to 122 degrees F), the board's manufacturer claims 
accuracy to within 0.4-degree C. 

The thermometer is quite simple to use. First, you attach the probe 
cables to the connectors on the peripheral board. Then the board is ready 
to be installed into one of the Apple's slots. If more than two probes are 
needed, multiple thermometer boards can be plugged into several slots. 
A dummy plug is also provided when only one sensor (or any odd 
number of sensors) is being used. You could just leave the input uncon- 
nected, but this slows down operation of the board. This is so because of 
the manner in which the Dual Thermometer converts the variable resistance 
signal from the probe into digital form for the computer— a process very

similar to tiie way the Apple reads game controllers. The conversion 
process takes longer when reading cold temperatures (high resistance). 
Therefore, an unconnected input (infinite resistance) takes the maxi- 
mum amount of time to read. The dummy plug simply puts a small re- 
sistance in place of the probe to eliminate this delay. 

The most impressive aspect of the Dual Thermometer is the soft- 
ware that accompanies it on disk. Several programs are provided that let 
you set up the Apple as a monitoring station. 

The Therm program is the most useful and is divided into two parts: 
setup and display. The setup portion lets you configure the system to your 
needs. Each probe can be named, given high and low alarm trip points, 
and set up to record minimum and maximum values over any given 
period. The program also supports time of day and calendar features. 
This information can be read from a clock board if you have one; other- 
wise, a timer on the thermometer board is used after you've preset the 
time and date by hand. 

Once all the probe parameters have been set up, the Apple can be 
placed into display mode. Once you've set up your parameters, all the 
pertinent information for each probe is shown on the screen. The cur- 
rent temperatures are updated every few seconds. The high and low 
temps are also displayed, along with the last time they were reset. The 
status of the alarms is also given. If they are enabled and the probe's tem- 
perature exceeds its limit, the computer begins to beep and an appro- 
priate flashing signal is displayed to indicate this condition. 

At any time, you can cause the data that's presently in memory to be 
stored on disk or sent to the printer. If you prefer, the program can also 
be configured to store or print data automatically at any given time or at 
regular intervals. Many other features that can be tailored to your needs 
are also available. This program is certainly quite versatile, and it is also 
(easily) expandable. You may wish to add other features such as the 
ability to control external devices according to temperature. While this 
would entail adding some extra hardware, the small software routine 
could be added to the Therm program. What makes this exceptionally 
easy is the fact that the program is written in Applesoft and is complete- 
ly documented in the user manual. Speaking of this manual, it is excel- 
lent (isn't that a change?)! In addition to the operating instructions, the 
manual provides a complete description of the hardware, a listing of the 
TJierm program (including a complete list of variables used), assembly 
language listings, and a wealth of useful information in an appendix. 

The Strawberry Tree Dual Thermometer sells for $260. 

Legend Slot 8 and Soft 8. Now that your Apple's slots are full and 
you have a fan to keep things running cool and a thermometer board to 
keep tabs on the temperature. Legend Industries has a couple of devices 
that allow you to add yet another peripheral card to your Apple. When 
you need just one more slot for your Apple, these units are low-cost al- 
ternatives to a complete expansion chassis such as the one offered by 
Mountain Computer. 

The Slot 8 is a small board that plugs into slot 7 of the Apple. 
Mounted on this board are two peripheral connectors similar to those in 
the Apple. Thus, you can plug two peripheral boards into the Slot 8 and 
have both of them occupy a single slot. These boards sit horizontally, one 
above the other, at the extreme far right of the computer. If you had a 
modulator or fan mounted there, it would have to be moved to a differ- 
ent slot. 

Of course, only one board can be used at a time. There is a large 
switch to select which board is active, and the computer must be turned 
off whenever this switch is changed. Therefore, the main advantage of 
the Slot 8 is that it eliminates the need for removing one board and re- 
placing it with another. This also saves wear and tear on the peripheral 
connectors. Furthermore, the Slot 8 provides a most convenient place to 
store that "ninth board" as opposed to putting it on a shelf or replacing it 
in its protective packaging. 

Typical uses for the Slot 8 would be for selecting between two alter- 
nate CPU cards — such as Z-80, 6809, and 8088 boards. Any pair of pe- 
ripherals that would be incompatible with each other are also likely can- 
didates. Devices such as the Applethrottle (June 1982), which may not 
command a permanent position in your Apple, become much more use- 
ful when installed in the Slot 8. They can then be available instantly with 
just the flip of a switch. 



For added convenience, there's also a Slot 8 extension switch avail- 
able. This attaches by way of a small ribbon cable and offers remote slot 
selection without having to remove the Apple's cover. Using double- 
sticky foam, this board can be attached to a convenient spot on the out- 
side of the computer. Just above the remote switch is a small display that 
reads out "7" or "8" to let you know which board is active. 

The other device offered by Legend is known as the Soft 8. This 
device also allows two cards to be placed in one slot, but offers software 
selection of the active board. This means you can switch between boards 
without turning off the computer and even from within a program. A 
small patch for DOS is also included on disk. This patch enables you to 
access the boards in Soft 8 with famibar commands, such as PR#7, 
PR#8, and so on. 

The process of installing the Soft: 8 is similar to that for the Slot 8. There 
are no switches on the board, however. Instead, one IC is removed from 
the Apple's motherboard and replaced with a jumper cable from the Soft 
8. Two LEDs on the board indicate which slot is active. 

One major difference between the Slot 8 and Soft 8 is how the periph- 
eral boards are powered. In the Slot 8, only one board is electrically 
powered at a time. Therefore, the power drain and heat generated come 
only from the active board. With the Soft 8, both boards are powered 
simultaneously and this adds to the power consumption and tempera- 
ture rise. If your computer can tolerate this extra load, then the Soft 8 is 
probably a more useful addition. The Slot 8 sells for $75, and the Soft 8 
for $85. Hi

□ SoftLink (Santa Clara, CA) has received 
$1.5 million in venture capital funding from 
U.S. Venture Partners and Rothschild Incor- 
porated. The company will utilize the infusion 
of funds "to turn its resources toward further 
development of the SoftLok encryption pro- 
gram and other projects that could revolution- 
ize software distribution," says Reid Ruther- 
ford, president and cofounder of the business 
applications software firm. 

Robert Katz, former director of marketing 
and sales for SKU Distributing, has joined the 
company as marketing director. He is responsi- 
ble for coordinating all marketing and sales 
plans and for the development of Softl^ink's 
sales force. 

□ Software Dimensions (Citrus Heights, CA) 
has adapted a new distribution policy for its 
Accounting Plus product line. Formerly distrib- 
uted exclusively by Systems Plus, with the result 
that many dealers don't know that Software 
Dimensions is the developer of the business ac- 
counting system, the company's products are 
now distributed through a network of regional 
and national distributors who will provide Soft- 
ware Dimensions with the name identification 
and control it desires. 

□ Fay and Eric Popejoy (of Tunnel Terror 
fame) can be found the first Sunday of every 
month at the Hollywood Science Fiction and 
Comic Book Convention at the Ambassador 
Hotel, Los Angeles. Both are members of the 
Academy of Science Fiction Fantasy and Hor- 
ror Films, and they bring a large collection of 
movie stills and memorabilia to the monthly 
convention. They also bring along an Apple 
and some well-chosen games, which draws a lot 
of business to their part of the room. "The kids 
love the games," says Fay, "and everyone else 
always asks us what kind of computer they 
should buy," to which she gives the obvious an- 
swer. 

□ Ken Landis has joined the management 
consulting department of the Saint Louis office 
of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Company, an 
international accounting and management con- 
sulting firm. He was previously partner and 
founder of Interface Associates, New York 
City, a microcomputer distribuUon and con- 
sulting business. Landis remains partial to 
buttonwood trees. 

□ Universal Systems for Education (Colora- 
do Springs, CO) has opened its first PAL learn- 
ing Center in the Denver suburb of Aurora, 
Colorado. The Center uses Apples and the PAL 
(Personal Aid to Learning) software developed 
by USE to teach reading to elementary school 
children. "Reading is the area of education that 



concerns parents most," says Dr. Dale Fore- 
man, vice president of curriculum develop- 
ment. "We developed the PAL reading soft- 
ware to capitalize on how fascinated cildren are 
with computers. Working with the computer 
can be very motivating for children who need to 
improve their reading skills. With the Learning 
Center, we can now offer that option to parents 
who don't have a computer at home." USE 
plans to open additional centers in Denver and 
Colorado Springs, expanding to a national fran- 
chise by late 1983. 

□ dilithium Press (Beaverton, OR) will intro- 
duce the first products of its new software divi- 
sion in January 1983, sold in sets with dilithium 
Press computer books. The packages will be 
sold through bookstores. Merl K. Miller, 
founder and part owner of dilithium Press, has 
been elected chairman of the board. Patricia 
Miller, formerly vice president of the firm, is 
now president, and Dan Ford, former distribu- 
tion and operations manager, has been named 
vice president of operations. Paul McGilvra, 
owner of the Times-Litho printing company 
and part owner of dilithium since 1980, is the 
company's new secretary/treasurer. 

□ Michael B. Shane, chairman of Leading 
Edge Products (Canton, MA), has announced 
that one cent from the sale of every Hephant 
disk sold in the world will be donated to the 
Jimmy Fund, founded to aid the parents of chil- 
dren with cancer. The fund makes contribu- 
tions to the Sidney Farber Cancer Institute to 
aid children who are the victims of cancer. 

□ Richard S. Sunderland has been named 
executive vice president and chief operating 
officer of Sierra On-Line (Coarsegold, CA). 
The appointment was announced by company 
president Ken Williams, along with the ap- 
pointment of T. Eugene Stroud as vice pres- 
ident of marketing. Sunderland comes to the 
company from Informatics, where he was vice 
president of software technology. He will be re- 
sponsible for the overall successful operation of 
Sierra On-Line. "In acquisitions, we are plan- 
ning to release at least two games and one busi- 
ness product each month in 1983, including 
conversions to different computer systems," says 
Sunderiand. "Sierra On-Line is also devising a 
revolutionary educational software line de- 
signed to be a teacher, .not just a primer." 
Stroud, previously with a Los Angeles film sup- 
plies and equipment distributor, will oversee the 
advertising, promotion, public relations, and 
sales efforts of the company. 

Licensing agreements have been successful- 
ly completed with SBD Software (Richmond, 
Surrey, England) to produce the company's 



software in the United Kingdom, and with 
Starcraft (Tokyo, Japan), for production and 
distribution in Japan. 

And for those who have wondered why On- 
Line changed its name, Sunderland says, 
"We're the progeny of Alvin Toffler's The 
Third Wave, a high-tech company nestled in the 
Sierra Nevada mountains. We believe our new 
name reflects that combinafion." 

□ Jim Warren, director of Computer Faire 
(Woodside, CA), has formed a video group to 
produce and market videotape tutorials on 
microcomputer programs. The first tapes will 
cover VisiCalc, SuperCalc, WordStar. CP/M, 
and a basic introduction to microcomputing. 
"The product tutorials will follow the same 
theme as the Impatient User's Guides series that 
we began in DataCast magazine a year ago," 
says Warren, "providing essential information 
to get the eager new user up and running quick- 
ly." The group will also take over production of 
the PBS television series "The Computer 
Chronicles." Following the signing of under- 
writers for the expanded-format show, it will be 
distributed to PBS and ETV networks nation- 
wide, and may be available to other nonprofit 
groups. 

□ Brillig Systems, software consultants, has 
moved from its Burke, Virginia, location. The 
new address is Box 2847, Springfield, VA 22152. 
The new telephone number is (703) 569-1338. 

□ Atasi (San Jose, CA), manufacturer of 5 
inch disk drives, has received $3.25 million in 
second-round financing. Participants include 
first-round capitalists U.S. Venture Partners 
and the Sprout Fund, a venture subsidiary of 
Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette. They are 
joined by new investors Memorial Drive Trust 
and First Chicago Investment Corporation. The 
funds will be used as working capital for Atasi's 
manufacturing and shipping activities involv- 
ing its 20, 33, and 46 megabyte 5 '/4-inch Win- 
chester disk drives. 

□ Information Unlimited Software has relo- 
cated to an expanded facility in Sausalito, Cali- 
fornia, moving from its former Berkeley head- 
quarters to the 17,000-square-foot facility to ac- 
commodate expansion in research and de- 
velopment and marketing. The company is now 
located at 2401 Marinship Way, Sausalito, CA 
94965; telephone (415) 331-6700. The company 
has signed a distribution agreement with Sears 
whereby Sears will be allowed to purchase I US 
business packages for sale in the chain of forty- 
six new Sears Business Systems Centers. 

□ Phoenix Software (Lake Zurich, IL) has in- 
troduced Copy Cruiser, a utility that allows the 
Apple software publisher to format and write a 



DECEMBER 1982

sixteen-sector, thirty-five-track disk in sixteen 
seconds. According to program author Dav 
Holle, "Many systems offer fairly fast copying, 
but in a commercial environment it is even 
more important to offer complete verification as 
well. Copy Cruiser has an option to verify all 
560 sectors during the write cycle to ensure a 
perfect copy every time. The complete verifica- 
tion process adds just seven seconds to the total 
copy time. In addition, each time Copy Cruiser 
is used, the RAM is first tested to ensure that 
memory chips are functioning correctly. Once 
the original is read in, the RAM contents are 
monitored to catch memory-related errors that 
could occur during extended duplicating ses- 
sions." 

□ A one-day seminar on improving industrial 
engineering with microcomputers will be held 
by the Institute of Industrial Engineers in San 
Jose, California, on January 24; in San Diego, 
January 25; and in Denver, Colorado, on Jan- 
uary 26. Gary Whitehouse, industry consul- 
tant on operations research, computer applica- 
tions, and network modeling, will lead seminars 
on equipment comparisons, case studies, Basic 
programming language, and a discussion of 
long-term implications of microcomputer usage 
in industrial engineering. Enrollment forms and 
information are available from HE Conference 
Department, 25 Technology Park, Atlanta, 
Norcross, GA 30092. 

□ Jamie Johnston, previously of Ithaca Inter- 
systems and Euro Micro, has been appointed 
director of sales with Micro Peripherals (Salt 
Lake City, UT). She will be responsible for sales 
training and marketing of PrintMate dot-matrix 
printers and Ap-Pak applications packages, and 
she'll use her telemarketing expertise in MPI's 
telephone marketing program, promoting direct 
contact with dealers, distributors, and OEMs. 

□ Business and Professional Software (Cam- 
bridge, MA), developer of Apple Business 
Graphics, has completed its first venture capital 
finance agreement, from which it will receive in 
excess of $300,000 from Eastedi Associates of 
Boston. BPS president David Solomont an- 
nounced that the company has also arranged a 
$400,000 line of bank credit with the Arlington 
Trust Company of Arlington, Massachusetts. 
Peter Gyenes, marketing consultant and for- 
mer vice president at Prime Computer, and Dr. 
Fontaine Richardson, visiting lecturer at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and co- 
founder of Applicon, have been named to the 
BPS board of directors. 

□ Link Systems (Santa Monica, CA) has ap- 
pointed Rick Gibson vice president of sales and 
marketing. Gibson most recently headed sales 
and marketing for KLH, a consumer elec- 
tronics manufacturer. 

□ Axiom Corporation (Calabasas, CA) has 
signed Indeserv to handle depot repair of their 
printer line. By calling (800) 343-0875, Axiom 
customers will be able to find the service depot 
nearest them, determine a flat rate repair 
charge, and have complete repairs in three to 
five working days. 



□ Computerland (Hayward, CA), the world's 
largest network of retail computer stores, has 
opened its three hundredth store in Baton 
Rouge, Louisiana, and its three hundred-first in 
Panama. Franchisees are licensed to open stores 
by the end of 1983 in Norway, Denmark, Fin- 
land, Spain, and Italy. Computerland is adding 
stores at a rate of fifteen per month, and antici- 
pates reaching the four hundred mark by year's 
end. Sales are expected to exceed $400 million, 
up 75 percent from 1981. "Our challenge," 
says president Ed Farber, "is to create on five 
other continents the kind of awareness and de- 
mand that exists in the United States and 
Canada." 

□ The recorder care division of Nortronics 
(Minneapolis, MN), manufacturer of magnetic 
read/write heads, has introduced a line of main- 
tenance products for personal computers. Intro- 
duced at the November Las Vegas Comdex 
show, the new line will be distributed to com- 
puter retail stores, catalog houses, and OEM ac- 
counts. 

□ TDK (Port Washington, NY), having an- 
nounced its entry into the floppy disk market, 
has appointed Frank Kramer national com- 
puter products manager. He will suf)ervise mar- 
keting and sales strategies for the company's ini- 
tial release of five types of floppy disks. Most re- 
cently director of European sales for Syncom, 
Kramer has been involved in magnetic media 
computer products since 1964. 

□ An advanced electronic mail service now 
available to subscribers of the Source (McLean, 
VA) is the first to meet the National Computer 
Based Message Systems standards developed by 
the National Bureau of Standards. As elec- 
tronic mail services upgrade their services to 
meet CBMS standards, it will become possible 
to exchange electronic mail among different sys- 
tems. The SourceMail service is the first elec- 
tronic mail to be wholly owned by Source Tele- 
computing rather than leased from a facility 
manager. "Having our own electronic mail not 
only gives us a superior product, but allows us 
to upgrade and fine-tune SourceMail con- 
tinually, plus tailor it for specific custom de- 
mands," says George Grune, chief executive of 
the company. "Our subscribers now have access 
to one of the most advanced personal com- 
munication services ever developed; soon they 
will belong to a nationwide, then worldwide, 
linking of similar communication networks." 

□ Dave Wertzberger, vice president of mar- 
keting and sales with SSM Microcomputer 
Products (San Jose, CA), has signed agree- 
ments with three new distributors: Sigma Dis- 
tributing, one of the original Apple distrib- 
utors, will be handling SSM's Apple hardware 
and software products in the Northwest; Com- 
putime, carrying the full line of Apple and S- 100 
products, will be marketing in the Midwest; and 
Micro D, longtime SSM Apple hardware and 
software distributor, will do business in the 
Southwest through a new localized Texas distri- 
bution center with its own sales and support 
staff.

SOFtCARD 
Symposium 

by Greg TSbbetts 



Once again we're nearing the end of another year. This month we'll 
complete our discussion of the SoftCard boot process with an examina- 
tion of the Z-80 boot code. 

As you'll remember from last month, the boot process up to the 
point at which the system is completely loaded into memory runs en- 
tirely in 6502 code. In the course of this period, three separate loaders 
execute, the presence of the SoftCard is determined, and various vectors 
required by the 6502 and/or other Apple hardware are initialized. 

With the exception of the loaders, little of this process has much to 
do with CP/M itself and its initialization. Rather, most of it is aimed at 
establishing the existence of a SoftCard and, if a SoftCard is present, at 
reconfiguring the Apple to create the special environment needed by 
CP/M. These two things determine whether or not it is safe to activate 
the operating system, and only when they have been established is the 
Z-80 awakened and the true CP/M boot code executed. While the 6502 
portion of the boot routines (except for the loader, of course) have no real 
counterpart on other CP/M systems, this Z-80 module is, as we shall see, 
very similar in purpose if not in content to the boot routine found on 
every CP/M system. 

Typically, the CP/M boot process in most systems consists of a 128 
or 256 byte loader (its size depends on the sector size of the disk format in 
use) called the Cold Start Loader plus a very short module labeled 
BOOT. This module initializes the stack pointer to lOOH, prints the fa- 
miliar sign-on message on the saeen (after clearing the screen, of course), 
and sets the current disk to 0 for drive A. Once these functions are com- 
pleted, BOOT branches to a routine (usually labeled GOCPM) that ini- 
tializes all of the temporary variables used by CP/M to their proper 
starting points and performs any necessary hardware initialization. 

GOCPM is usually a part of the CP/M warm boot routine and is 
called after the CCP and BDOS have been reloaded from disk during the 
warm boot process. The SoftCard Z-80 boot code, hereafter called Boot, 
begins at the end of the various BIOS routines and is comprised of 333 
bytes of Z-80 code. It is somewhat larger than the boot routines on other 
CP/M implementations because it is required to do considerably more 
things. 

Boot begins at address 0DEA8H for 56K (0AEA8H for 44K since 
the 44K BIOS begins at OAAOOH as opposed to ODAOOH for 56K). The 
additional tasks that the boot code is required to perform are primarily a 
result of the flexibility of the Apple II. The Apple II is unhke other sys- 
tems in that its hardware can be modified easily by simple rearrange- 
ment or substitution of peripheral cards. 

Boot must be capable of completely reconfiguring itself during every 
cold boot cycle. In other CP/M systems this is not required, since these 
systems do not have expansion capability in a standard way. Some are 
simply not expandable other than by the addition of the manufacturer's 
printer and drives, in which case CP/M always knows what the hard- 
ware will look like. Other CP/M systems are infinitely expandable, but 
there is no standard protocol for hardware, so no matter how big Boot 
and the BIOS code were, they could not hope to recognize and deal with 
all the various peripherals that could be connected. In such systems, no 
reconfiguration of the BIOS is allowed without altering the source code 
and reassembling it. 



II 

The Apple II is unique: expansion of the system is easy, and al- 
though peripherals are made by many different manufacturers, each 
manufacturer must follow a set protocol. The standard protocol makes it 
relatively easy for the 6502 loader code to build a table, which Boot then 
uses to reconfigure the BIOS. 

Specifically, Boot first loads the Stack Pointer with the address 
OlOOH as a default during its operation. This gives it stack space equiva- 
lent to the last 128 bytes of the temporary workspace area between 0 and 
lOOH. This is done simply to initialize the location of the stack to some- 
place where there is no code or data that may be overwritten during the 
operation of Boot. The location used is not really important since the 
stack won't be there long. This stack space will only be used during the 
execution of Boot and GOCPM (perhaps two to six bytes used, maxi- 
mum), since the CCP reserves sixteen bytes within itself as its own eight- 
level stack, and BDOS reserves forty-eight bytes within itself as its own 
twenty-four-level stack. 

Once it has positioned the Stack Pointer, Boot's next job is to destroy 
the jump vector to itself This vector is the only means by which Boot can 
be accessed. You should remember from last month how we arrived at 
the Z-80 boot code — by means of a jump to the beginning of BIOS 
(ODAOOH or OAAOOH), placed at location OOOOH, and a jump to the 
actual boot code placed at the beginning of BIOS. Boot destroys the 
route to itself by overwriting the JP instruction (0C3H) at the beginning 
of BIOS with a RET instrucdon (0C9H); this substitution of an RET for 
a JP causes any calling program simply to return, with no activity hav- 
ing been performed. The obvious question, though, is why does Boot 
want to cover its tracks? 

The answer lies in the fact that certain code, such as the initial place- 
ment of the Stack Pointer and, in some systems, the initial configuration 
of interrupts, has to be executed only once — on cold boot. Once 
executed, these routines would simply be taking up valuable space if they 
were allowed to remain. By destroying the jump vector to itself. Boot 
enables the operating system to overwrite these no longer essential rou- 
tines and make room for data storage. In this way, CP/M makes maxi- 
mum use of the available memory by not allowing Boot to occupy and 
waste valuable space indefinitely. In our later discussions on the BIOS 
organization, we'll be covering some of the data space needed by the 
system. 

We left off with Boot just as it had made sure it would never again be 
found. Boot's next task is to set up in the default lOBYTE at location 
0003H in the temporary workspace. You'll remember from last month 
that locations 0000 to 0002 were the jump vector, first to Boot, then to 
warm boot; and that, location 0003 was the lOBYTE, 0004 was the cur- 
rent disk, and 0005 to 0007 was the jump vector to BDOS. 

Boot is now setting up the lOBYTE in its initial configuration. This 
concept of the lOBY TE is derived from and corresponds to the Intel 
standard method of device mapping. The lOBYTE is a single location in 
memory that provides a constant indication of the particular assignment 
of physical to logical devices. This subject was originally discussed a 
number of months ago in a column on the lOCB, but since so much time 
has passed, let's take a short look at what it means specifically. 

As we mentioned then, CP/M is designed to be organized into a 



284 



^OI:TAl 1/ 



DECEMBER 1982 



standard interface to users and their programs and a custom interface to 
the hardware — a logical side and a physical side, if you will. To deal with 
I/O in the system, the logical module or BDOS must always work 
through the physical module or BIOS. Since the BIOS could really con- 
sist of anything and the system could be hooked to any type of hard- 
ware, and since the BDOS must organize this somehow, BDOS is set 
up to deal in terms of devices. From the standpoint of BDOS, these 
are logical devices capable of handling only input or output in a very 
general form, while from the standpoint of BIOS, they are physical de- 
vices that give input and receive output in specific ways. 

For the purposes of conserving memory and keeping things simple, 
the BDOS is set up to handle three kinds of input and two kinds of 
output through four logical devices. They are CON:, which handles both 
input and output and stands for console; RDR:, which is input only and 
stands for paper tape reader; PUN:, which is output only and stands for 
paper tape punch; and LST:, which is output only and stands for list. 
There are, therefore, five types of requests that BDOS can make to BIOS 
for I/O. These are the BIOS functions CONIN, CONOUT, LIST, 
PUNCH, and READER. While the two console requests and the hst re- 
quest generally deal with their namesakes, that is, the console and the 
printer, the punch and reader may be any type of device, providing that 
punch is output and reader is input. 

In many systems, these four devices and five types of I/O may be suf- 
ficient to handle the actual hardware contained in the system. In other 
systems, however, there may be considerably more physical devices con- 
nected that are capable of the same type of I/O. For example, the com- 
puter system may have two printers, or it may have a printer and a paper 
tape punch, or it may simply have a CRT and a printer. In each case, 
output of data could be directed equally well to any of these devices, and 
at various times the user may wish to arrange things various ways. A 
means was set up, therefore, to allow the user to alternate between such 
devices by assigning the four logical devices (kinds of I/O) to more than

of the logical devices. In some cases this is for good reason (you wouldn't 
want to assign an output physical device to an input only logical device), 
but in others it appears to be rather arbitrary. 

The number of physical devices allowed was also established by the 
designers of CP/M. It may still not be equal to the number of devices the 
system actually contains, but it will no doubt come closer than the mere 
four allowed in BDOS itself. The physical devices and the logical devices 
to which they can be assigned are shown in table 1. 

The permissible assignments are summarized as folio wsi

The lOBYTE, then, merely keeps track of which devices on the right of 
the equal sign correspond to which BDOS I/O functions shown at the left. 
When BDOS makes a call to LIST, for example, to perform the LST out 
function, the BIOS can examine the current value of the lOBYTE to de- 
termine which of up to four devices to use. The assignments via lOBYTE 
are made by means of the STAT program, and assigning LST = CRT, 
for example, causes any output from PIP LST := filename. typ to appear 
on the screen. Likewise, any control-P causes an echoing of both the 
CONOUT and LIST output to appear on the screen (very confusing). 

Boot's responsibility is to set up the initial value of lOBYTE. 

It should be noted that we have talked only conceptually about the 
lOBYTE assignment and not practically. We will cover practical mat- 
ters more fully in a later column on interfacing. For now, keep in mind 
that the only time the lOBYTE is set is during a cold boot, so if this val- 
ue is somehow destroyed or significantly altered, there may be some bi- 
zarre I/O until the next cold boot. 

Boot's next job is to take the now known address of the SoftCard (re- 
member that writing to this address in Z-80 mode is what reactivates the 
6502) and place it into the general-purpose 6502 activation routine in the 
BIOS. This routine, known as CALL65, is the way in which various 6502 
routines are called. It is located at 0DB3BH (or 0AB3BH for 44K), and 
to use it you simply place the address (in 6502 terms) of the 6502 routine 
to be called in the HL register and call CALL65. The routine handles set- 
ting up the 6502 vector and turning off the Z-80, returning to the caller 
routine when the 6502 is finished and the Z-80 has been reactivated. 

The BIOS, as it is loaded, contains zeros in the address field of the 
6502 activation instruction (an LD (0000),A). In this instance. Boot is 
simply putting in the proper address, now that it's been discovered by the 
Z-80 finder. 

Next, Boot loads a temporary location in the temporary workspace 
(called CDISK) with the value 00. This is location 0004H, which, as we 
said earlier, is the place BDOS and CCP always look to find the current- 
ly logged disk. Boot places a 00 there to indicate drive A, since the drives 
proceed in numeric order, that is, A,B,C,...P = 0,1, 2,. ..15. 

This completes the inifialization of CP/M temporary variables. Aside 
from the loading of the SoftCard address, this procedure is the same on 
all CP/M systems that implement the lOBYTE function. Most of the 
rest of Boot's functions will be Apple-specific. 

The first of these remaining tasks is to determine what type of pe- 
ripheral card (if any) is installed in slot 3. To do this, Boot accesses the 
slot types table SLTTYP, which was set up in the lOCB by the cold load- 




Volume TWO! 



T.M. 

by Bob Nacon 



The success of the original Amper-Mag i c" program package and the 
introduction of its technique for attaching new commands to Applesoft 
programs has stimulated the production of Command Library" packages 
designed around a 'theme' such as information display or output, input, 
memory management, etc., which will enhance your Applesoft programs. They 
will give your program a professional operation and appearance by 
increasing speed, reducing size, and giving you features you never could 
have before, while still allowing you to program with the ease of BASIC. 

Ampei — Magic Command Library No. 2 is dedicated to information display 
and output capabilities. Read on and enjoy the new programming power 
Ampei — Magic Command Library No. 2 will give you. 

This disk contains 27 machine language routines ready to be inserted 
quickly and painlessly Into your own Applesoft programs. Included among 
them is the most powerful PRINT USING routine yet created for Applesoft, 
as well as some small but very handy routines for controlling the appear- 
ance and activity on the display screen. 

In order to use these commands, you wil I need the Ampei — Magic program 
itself which is contained on Volume One. SOME commands on this disk are: 

** Access the most powerful PRINT USING command EVER for the Apple. 
It sure does more than just line up decimal points! It works with 
strings of characters as wel I as numbers, and lets the program de- 
cide whether to make them Flash or Inverse or Normal depending on 
conditions you specify. With numbers, you can have fixed or 
floating dollar sign and/or optional commas and a variety of fill 
characters. You can embed standard phrases within your format de- 
sign. You can even print to the screen WHILE outputtinq to the 
printer! And generate NO GARBAGE to collect! All in all, the 
most powerful PRINT USING yet! 

** Print to the screen while a peripheral is active 

** Save and restore instantly any text screen, no matter how complex 
with flashing, inverse, and any window settings... 

** Make your program WAIT a length of time specified in ordinary sec- 
onds (to the tenth of a second); the time may be a variable or 
expression which can be controlled by the program, , . 

** Print anywhere on the screen under program control, either with 
absolute movements or with relative movements.,. 

** Print string arrays to any device, with or without an appended 
special character, and WITHOUT A LOOP.., 

** Set, clear, or toggle ANY bit or bits anywhere in RAM memory,,, 

** Check the keyboard when called, pause if SPACEBAR is pressed, then 
continue if SPACE Is pressed again or GOTO a location if RETURN is 
pressed... 

** Print the current text screen on command or from the program... 

** Send ASCII characters to peripheral devices and POKE peripheral 
card memory to set or clear bits for control purposes... 

** AND MORE...,

er code as it examined the cards in each slot. 

In SoftCard CP/M, slot three is reserved for an eighty-column card 
or an external terminal interface. As such, the only card types CP/M 
recognizes here are Apple Communications Cards, serial cards, or 
eighty-column cards (which usually appear as serial cards). If an ex- 
ternal terminal or eighty-column board is found here. Boot uses the card 
type byte (implicitly combined with the slot) to select the address of the 
appropriate read and write routine in the BIOS needed to communicate 
with the card. 

The BIOS contains all three output routines, for serial cards, parallel 
cards, and Apple Communications Cards; and both input routines, for 
serial and Communications Cards. It finds the appropriate addresses 
and installs them in the address fields of certain jump instructions in the 
BIOS CONIN and CONOUT routines that are called by BDOS. At the 
same time, the warm boot code is modified in a special way. Normally, 
the warm boot code alters the CCP every time it loads it, so that when di- 
rectories are printed to the screen they are only two columns wide and fit 
on the Apple's forty-column screen. If an eighty-column device is found. 
Boot patches the warm boot code so that a value indicating the normal 
four-column directories is installed in CCP. 

Boot's next task is to determine if a p)eripheral card exists in slot 1 . It 
does so using SLTTYP in the same way as it did for slot 3. Since slot 1 is 
reserved for a printer interface (an output-only device), and since any of 
the cards Boot can recognize will perform output, any card recognized in 
this slot is treated as such a device. Again using the card-type byte. Boot 
selects the address of the appropriate write routine for that type of card 
and installs this address into a jump vector in the BIOS LIST routine. 

The final bit of peripheral configuration occurs with slot 2, which is 
reserved for reader and punch devices. Using the same technique as be- 
fore. Boot determines whether a card is present. If a card is found, the 
address of the proper write routine is placed into the jump vector in the 
PUNCH roufine, again since all peripheral cards recognized by Boot will 
perform output. If the card is not a serial or an Apple Communications 
Card, however, it won't be able to handle input, and so the reader func- 



tion won't be implemented. 

To follow the general guidelines of Digital Research, the reader rou- 
tine is altered in these cases to return immediately with the value lAH, 
the ASCII end-of-file character. This is to prevent the system from hang- 
ing, either because of waiting for input or because it's receiving a con- 
stant flow of garbage from a nonexistent device; the latter problem may 
occur if the user attempts to access the RDR: device using PIP, for ex- 
ample. The same patch is made to the reader code if no card is discov- 
ered in the slot. 

At this point. Boot has taken care of the four necessary logical de- 
vices by patching their associated routines so they access the correct 
hardware. The next step is to initialize the hardware devices. 

Unlike parallel cards, serial and Apple Communications Cards re- 
quire that the serial I/O chip on the card be initialized to the proper val- 
ues before the cards will work. Initializafion sets such things as baud rate, 
parity, number of stop bits, and so on. Boot does this by calling the gen- 
eral initialization roufine, lOINIT, located in the BIOS. lOINIT is also 
called by the warm boot code when it is executed. 

lOINIT funcfions by counting down the slots, identifying serial and 
communications cards, and resetting the hardware to the proper val- 
ues — and then calling the serial card init routine. When all such cards 
have been initialized, lOINIT returns control to Boot. 

Boot then finishes up by printing the sign-on message. This is ac- 
complished by first finding the software screen-function character in the 
lOCB for clear screen (Boot looks it up each fime, since this code may be 
permanently altered by the user with CONFIGIO) and then outputfing 
it (with its lead-in character, if necessary) by calling the BIOS console 
output routine that Boot itself just patched. Once this has been done, the 
actual sign-on message is printed one character at a fime in the same 
fashion. 

In early versions of the BIOS, the software screen-function character 
for lo-lite (that is, noninverse) was also sent just before the sign-on mes- 
sage. This was to make sure that CP/M did not start up in inverse or hi- 
lite mode if the user had last been in either of those modes. This se-

quence, however, was not handled well by Hazeltine terminals; conse- 
quently, version 2.20B was patched to skip this routine. 

After the printing of the message. Boot transfers control to the rou- 
tine we called GOCPM, which is itself a part of the warm boot code. We 
will examine this routine next. 

The warm boot code, not to be confused with the warm loader about 
which we spoke last month, is a routine in the BIOS that reloads the 
CCP and BDOS and reinitializes the CP/M temporary storage loca- 
tions. Its aaual label in CP/M is WBOOT, so we'll refer to it as Wboot 
from now on. When it's entered at GOCPM, three things in Wboot are 
bypassed; setting the stack pointer to 80H, loading the CCP and BDOS 
using the warm loader, and calling lOINIT. 

Aside from those three things, which have already been done during 
the boot process, Boot's access is no different from a standard warm 
boot. In version 2.20B, there is an additional function that doesn't get 
performed. It relates to the application note passed out by Microsoft, 
called Turnkey. This program allows a user to install an auto-run capa- 
bility to CP/M such that whenever the system is booted, a certain pro- 
gram or sequence of characters will be executed as if it had been typed in 
at the keyboard. Since this command line is stored directly in the CCP, it 
is executed every time the CCP is loaded and branched to (that is, with 
every warm boot). 

In 2.20B, therefore, there is a routine that zeros the command line 
length in CCP after reloading it during warm boots, thereby teUing CCP 
that no command exists. In versions prior to 2.20B, the Turnkey utility 
did not exist, and therefore this routine was not in the warm boot code. 
Using Turnkey with the early version makes the command line execute 
on both warm and cold boots, which is generally undesirable. Obviously, 
this routine must be bypassed in 2.20B when we enter at GOCPM or the 
auto- run feature will not function. 

The first action of GOCPM is the zeroing of two flags in the disk ac- 



cess code that the BIOS uses to block and deblock the 256-byte Apple 
disk sectors into 128-byte CP/M sectors. These flags essentially reset the 
disk access code to a start-up condition that indicates there is no valid 
unwritten data in the disk buffers and no in-process deblocking takmg 
place. 

The next task is the installation of a jump instruction and the ad- 
dress BI0S-)-3 (a jump instruction to Wboot) into the vector at location 
0000. It was this location that originally contained the address of the be- 
ginning of BIOS, which was the jump to Boot. It now points three bytes 
beyond that address, to the jump to Wboot. This makes it easy for ap- 
plications programs to exit and reload the CCP by simply performing a 
branch to location OOOOH. 

Third, GOCPM places a jump instruction and the address of BDOS 
into the vector at location 0005. It is this location that is called by appli- 
cations programs when they wish to perform a BDOS function call. 

Fourth, GOCPM sets the default DMA address to 80H by calling the 
BIOS SETDMA function. The DMA address is the location at which 
128-byte CP/M sectors will appear in memory if a disk read is requested 
and the location from which such sectors will be taken if a disk write is 
requested. Applications programs may set this anywhere they wish with- 
in the TPA, but it is always set to 80H as a default for standard CCP 
loads. 

Finally, GOCPM patches the directory width value in CCP to either 
1 or 3 to indicate two or four column directories based on the width of 
the display device, and this completes its operation. At this point it 
branches to the beginning of CCP and the system is operational. 

This examination of the boot process was intended to be informa- 
tional. While its practical aspects are limited, knowing how the Boot 
process works will come in handy as we begin our in-depth examination 
of the BIOS routines and our discussions of the BDOS and CCP opera- 
tion. Until next month. ... -^W

Exploring Business Basic, Part 15 

Lots of exciting things have happened on 
the Apple III frontier since we last talked, and if 
any of you haven't heard about the new prod- 
ucts Apple announced at Comdex, you should 
really check them out at your dealer's. One 
other product is worthy of note as well, a new 
piece of software from Quark Engineering, the 
Word Juggler people. The program is called 
Catalyst, a perfect name for the package, since it 
can control the start-up and execution of all 
your Apple III programs from a single com- 




mand menu. This means that you can load all 
your application programs and language inter- 
preters onto mass storage devices (such as the 
ProFile). Once you've booted the Catalyst pro- 
gram, going from Apple Writer to Basic to Visi- 
Calc to Senior Analyst to Pascal to System Util- 
ities is as easy as hitting a sfjecial key and pick- 
ing the application off the menu. Yes, even pro- 
tected programs like VisiCalc are provided for! 
If you haven't seen this program yet, zip down 
to your dealer for a demo or get in touch with 
Quark; it's really something. 

One more note: The version of the console 
driver on the Catalyst disk implements several 
new events and allows the normal "read with 
wait" request to the console to accept inter- 
rupts. This means that things like generalized 
device spooling and some limited task switch-

Sifting through the Sorts. Last month we 
started exploring sort techniques, covering the 
simple but slow bubble sort, the Shell sort, and 
a somewhat esoteric sort that was referred to as 
an inverted list sort, good for situations where 
there are a large number of items but only a few 
values. Although the inverted sort is generally 
used for string data, such as state codes, sex 
codes, and so on, it is also very useful on nu- 
meric data where the same principle (lots of 
items, only a few unique values) applies. This 
month we will look at a faster version of the 
Shell sort, called the quick sort, and a new sort 
technique called the binary tree sort. Let's look 
quickly at the quick sort (heh, heh), and then 
explore the binary sort in some detail. 

The Big Shuffle. For simplicity, we'll start 
with the routine we used last time to generate 
random numbers to sort in an array called 
sarray. The actual sort routine will be con- 
tained in a subroutine. The main program looks 
like this: 

100 DIM sarray(1000),stack(100) 
110 INPUT"Sort Routine. Number of 

elements to generate: ";a$ 
120 n=CONV(a$):IF n<2 THEN 200 
130 FOR i=1 TO n:sarray(i) = RND(1):NEXT 
135 PRINT"Start of Sort" 
140 GOSUB 1000 




! m a n 



150 PRINT"Son complete. First 10 elements 
are:" 

160 FOR i = 1 TO 10:PRINT sarray(i);" "; 
:NEXT 

170 PRINT:PRINT:GOTO 110 
200 END 

As you can see, line 130 generates a set of 
random values in sarray, and then a gosub is 
performed to sort the array. As we discussed 
last time, one way to improve the performance 
of "exchange" type sorts (the name that the 
bubble. Shell, and quick sorts share) is to make 
the exchanges cover as much territory as pos- 
sible in one swap. Quick sort algorithms go this 
one better by first guessing the midpoint of the 
values to be sorted and then swapping other 
values based on this hypothetical middle value. 
Furthermore, the initial swaps are performed 
on the opposite ends of the array. The quick 
sort gets further speed by successively parti- 
tioning the sets of values into smaller groups 
and working on each group until it is small 
enough to be sorted by simple swaps. While this 
makes for a much more complicated group of 
instructions, far fewer iterations of the code 
have to be performed. Faster performance is 
therefore possible. Here's the routine: 

1000 REM Initialize begin and end points 

1005 a=1:stack{1) = n+1:m= 1 

1010 j = stack{a):i = m-1 

1020 IF j-m<3 THEN 1100 

1030 mid = INT({i+j)/2) 

1040 i = i+1:IF i=j THEN 1060:ELSE:IF 

sarray(i)<=sarray(mid) THEN 1040 
1050 j=j-1:IFi<>j THEN IF sarray 

(j)<sarray(mid) THEN SWAP sarray(i), 

sarray(j):GOTO 1040:ELSE:GOTO 

1050 

1060 IF i> = mid THEN i=i-1 
1070 IF jOmid THEN SWAP 

sarray(i),sarray(mid) 
1080 a = a+1:stack(a) = i:G0T0 1010 
1090 REM Cfieck for cases of 1 or 2 elements 
1100 IF j-m<2 THEN 1130 
1110 IF sarray (m)> = 

sarray(m+ 1) THEN SWAP 

sarray(m),sarray(m+ 1) 
1120 REM Set begin and end points and 

cfieck for completion 
1130 m = stack(a) + 1:a=a-1:IF a > 0 

THEN 1010 
1140 RETURN 



Several things are worthy of note here. First, 
it is necessary to use the same code to operate 
on each of the partitions of data that will be 
sorted. In some programming languages, this 
would be handled by means of a technique 
called recursion. Recursion simply means that a 
routine can call itself, without limit. Basic not 
only has limits on how many times a gosub can 
be executed without a return, it also has the at- 
tribute that all variables are global; in other 
words, each occurrence of a subroutine uses the 
same variables over again, forgetting their pre- 
vious state. For those reasons and others, the 
previous routine uses the stack array to main- 
tain information about each partition of the ar- 
ray and to work its way through each parti- 
tioned set until all are sorted. Note also the 
extensive use of the swap command, to ex- 
change values in the most efficient manner 
possible. 

The quick sort algorithm is generally faster 
than the Shell sort, except in those circum- 
stances where the data is already sorted, or 
nearly so. Shell sorts will work through such ar- 
rays faster than the quick sort, which takes al- 
most as long to arrange sorted data as it does to 
arrange data that's in random order. 

It would be appropriate to consider the last 
example of quick sort. The example given ear- 
lier used the direct sorting of numeric data as an 
example. Quick sort can be used just as easily to 
sort string data, or simply to create sorted 
pointers to any type of data array. The next 



example takes string data from a file and per- 
forms a pointer sort. Remember that it is gen- 
erally more efficient to swap numeric pointers 
than to swap strings. Voila: 

100 DIM sarray( 1000), stack 

(100),sort$(1000) 
110 INPUT"Sort Routine. Filename to sort: 

";a$ 

120 IF 8$ = "" THEN GOTO 

200:ELSE:OPEN#1 AS INPUT,a$ 
125 ON E0F#1 LET sarray(0) = 

i-1 :n = sarray(0):GOTO 140 
130 PRINT TIMES;" Start of sort" 
135 FOR 1=1 TO 1000: sarray(i) = 1: INPUT#1 , 

i;son$(i):NEXT 
140 GOSUB 1000 
145 PRINT TIMES;" End of sort" 
150 INPUT"Sort complete. Do you want to list 

the sorted records?";aS 
160 IF a$<>"Y" AND a$<>"y" THEN 110 
170 FOR i = 1 TO sarray(O): 

INPUT#1,sarray(i);aS: PRINT a$:NEXT 
180 GOTO 110 
200 END 

The main routine has been changed consid- 
erably. SortS has been added as a string array 
for holding the values to be sorted. The string 
values are to be read from a random access text 
file instead of being generated by the program. 
In addition, line 125 sets up the on EOF state- 
ment, which will detect the end of data, set the 
appropriate values, and start the sort. Note al- 
so that the timeS function is being used. If you 
don't have a clock chip, you can time this 
yourself. 



One of the advantages of using a file for in- 
put is that you can make multiple runs under 
the same conditions to test the efficiency of par- 
ticular sorting algorithms. Line 135 uses sarray 
as a pointer array to the actual position of the 
sortS values. The subroutine at line 1000 has 
been modified to use sarray as a pointer array 
so that the string won't have to be swapjjed di- 
rectly. 

1000 REM Initialize begin and end points 

1005 a= 1:stack(1) = n+1:m= 1 

1010 j = stack(a):i=m- 1

that allow the if statements to test the proper 
element of sortS and to swap the pointers if nec- 
essary. After the sort is complete, the pointer 
values in sarray are used in line 170 to look up 
the records in sorted order. 

To use this program effectively as it stands, 
you need a program that will generate text files 
to be sorted. The next program will create a 
file of random junk that is useful for testing the 
sort routines and will come in handy later on in 
this article. It looks like this:

four-digit number. Examples of the records pro- 
duced look like this:

ABDDC 4982 
FFBBA 1965 

A slightly fancier version would prompt for 
the name of the file to be created, the record 
length, and so on, but this will serve nicely for 
the examples to follow. Generating two hun- 
dred records should be sufficient for testing the 
sort routines. Any more would slow things 
down unnecessarily without proving anything; 
any fewer would make it difficult to measure the 
consequences of changes to the program. For 
example, running two hundred records through 
the quick sort routine should finish in about 
forty seconds. 

Note: Don't forget to turn the screen off 
during sorting! This can be done by a control-5 
from the keyboard or by programatically print- 
ing an ASCII 14 to the console. The Apple III 
will still write information to the screen, but 
having it turned off during the sort speeds up 
operations by as much as 30 percent. This can 
make quite a difference when you're sorting or 
calculating, esp>ecially when you usually don't 
need to see the results until the operation is 
complete. This is also a favorite trick of Visi- 
Calc users during recalculates or loads. The 
console driver automatically turns the screen 
back on when the next input request occurs. 

Living in a Tree. Although the Shell and 
quick sort algorithms are quite efficient, they 
share one disadvantage that makes them diffi- 
cult to use in some circumstances. There are oc- 
casions in processing data when multilevel sorts 
are desired. That is, somebody wants an ad- 
dress list arranged alphabetically by zip code. 
This means that the printout will group all peo- 
ple with the same zip code together and list 
them alphabetically within each zip code group. 

To accomplish this multilevel sort, you must 
first sort alphabetically, and then sort by zip 
code the alphabetical list obtained. This implies 
that each sort must preserve the physical order 
of the previous sort. Unfortunately, the very 
fact that speeds up Shell sorts and quick sorts — 
the swapping of data over long distances — de- 
stroys the original order of the data, making 
multilevel sorts impossible to implement. Our 
old friend, the bubble sort, does preserve order, 
but it is impossibly slow. There are several sort 
techniques that solve this problem, but the one 
chosen for this article is the binary tree sort. 
This sort has the added virtue of very rapid in- 
sertion of additional records once the existing 
records are sorted, making it also a very suit- 
able access method. 

Before getting into the routine itself, an 
examination of the principles behind a binary 
tree data structure is a worthwhile exercise. 

First, let's consider a list of names that we'd 
like to arrange in order 

Jim Bill Nancy Fred Sue 
June George William Martha Frank 

To arrange these names into a binary tree 
structure, we take the first name on the list as 



our starting point, or root. For the sake of sim- 
plicity, we'll consider this to be an upside-down 
tree, with the root at the top. To build branches 
off the tree, we take each element of the list, one 
at a time, and decide whether it should be con- 
nected on the right or left side of the root. For 
example: 

Jim 



Bil 



Since Bill is evaluated as less than Jim (based on 
alphabetical value rather than on a character 
judgment), it is placed on a branch to the left. 
The next name, Nancy, goes on a right-hand 
branch, since it is greater than Jim. Following 
this logic, let's add Fred, Sue, and June. The 
tree now looks like this: 



Jim 



Bill 

\ 

Fred 



Nancy 

/ \ 
June Sue 



To review the process quickly, it went some- 
thing like this: Fred was less than Jim, but there 
is already an entry on the right branch, so that 
entry (Bill) was examined. Since Fred is greater 
than Bill, Fred was attached to a right-hand 
branch below Bill. In the same way, Sue is 
greater than Jim, so Nancy is checked, and 
since Sue is still greater than Nancy, Sue is 
placed on a right-hand branch. June, however, 
while greater than Jim, is less than Nancy, and 
therefore goes to the left-hand branch. 
Constructing the rest of the tree with George, 
William, Martha, and Frank gives a final result 
like this: 



Jim 



Nancy 



Fred 



Frank George 



June Sue 



Martha William 



While aU this seems lovely and can certain- 
ly be accomplished with very few comparisons, 
what does it have to do with sorting? Good 
question! In a sense, it shares something of the 
technique used in quick sort, since we have par- 
tioned the data into very small groups that have 
a relationship to each other. It is these interre- 
lationships that permit building a sorted list 
from this structure very quickly. 

Two things should be obvious. No matter 
what value is used as a starting point, the value 
on the extreme left-hand side of the tree is the 
smallest, and the value on the extreme right- 
hand side is the largest. To assemble the list in 
ascending order, then, you must first go to the 
left until there are no more branches leading 
left. In this tree, that value is Bill. Bill becomes 
the first item in the sorted list. Next, we go 
down Bill's right branch, to its leftmost value. 
That's Frank, the next item in the list. Fred is 
next, because it must be greater than Frank 
(since Frank was to the left of Fred), and 
George is next, since it is the last item remain- 
ing on the left-hand side of the tree. That takes 



DECEMBER 1982 



^Ol- I Al 1^ 



293 



US up to the top of the tree, where Jim gets 
added to the list, and the right-hand side is ex- 
plored for its smallest (leftmost) value. Follow- 
ing the branches, June is added as the next list 
item, and then Martha. Since that branch is ex- 
hausted, Nancy is next, and when Nancy's 
other branch is explored no additional left-hand 
branches are found. That finishes the list, with 
the addition of Sue and William. 

All that now allows us to say that the sorted 
order is: 

Bill 

Frank 

Fred 

George 

Jim 

June 

Martina 

Nancy 

Sue 

Wiiliam 

Although this seems like an awful lot of 
trouble to go to in order to sort a list of ten 
names, you should notice a few things that 
make this technique powerful. First, we are or- 
dering the data as it is initially examined, and 
once we find a place for an item, it is never 
moved again. Further, if the tree is relatively 
well balanced (more on that later), it doesn't 
take many comparisons to establish a place for 
an item. Once the tree is built, a sorted list can 
be obtained easily, and without re-examining 
the item values, since the position in the tree 
structure itself is enough to establish the order. 
Furthermore, if we store pointers in the tree, in- 
stead of the actual items themselves, it's not 
necessary to move the items at all. To show how 
this would work, consider the original list of 
names, with their associated pointers.

We can assemble another list next to this 
one that contains all the binary tree information 
simply by indicating for each item what items 
are immediately below it in the tree. If we were 
to use zero to indicate that the particular branch 
is empty, the new list would look like this:

These lines do the initialization. Note especially 
the sortpointl% and sortpointr% arrays. These 
will hold the left and right pointers we just de- 
scribed. Parray% will hold the sorted list of 
pointers, and slist% holds the initial list of point- 
ers as read from the file. SortS, as you might ex- 
pect, holds the sort keys to be examined, and 
stack% holds temporary pointers used in as- 
sembling the binary tree structure into a sorted

Notice that this section has a couple of inter- 
esting features. The limitation of eleven char- 
acters in the file name allows the creation of a 
key file, which stores the current sorted hst. 
This, together with the feature that allows sort- 
ing on a subset of the whole record, permits 
multilevel sorting to be done. Line 75 opens this 
file, and line 80 checks to see if there is valid da- 
ta there. Line 95 then initializes the pointer ar- 
ray sbst%; depending on whether the sequence 
to be used is serial from the mail file or from the 
previously sorted list.

380 FOR i = 1 TO slist%(0):INPUT#o1,parray 

%(i);a$:PRINT a$:NEXT:GOTO 40 
400 PRINT:PRINT"End of sort program." 
410 GLOSE:END 

As you can see, the main operations of the 
program are handled in the subroutine at line 
500, which reads records and constructs the bi- 
nary tree structure, and the subroutine at line 
800, which builds the sorted pointers in the 
parray% array by decoding the structure in the 
tree. After that, the list of sorted pointers is 
stored in the key file, and the user is given the 
option of listing out the records. Note that al- 
though the user may have chosen to sort only 
on a small portion of the record, the routine at 
line 380 reads and prints the entire record. Next, 
let's examine the binary tree build routine: 

490 REM Routine to build ttie B-tree 

500 ON E0F#1 LET 

slist%(0) = rec-1:POP:RETURN 

510 rec= 1:G0SUB 700 

520 FOR rec=2 TO slist%(0) 

530 GOSUB 700 

540 IF sort$(rec)>=sort$(testrec) THEN 570 
550 IF sortpointl%{testrec) THEN testrec= 

sortpointl%{testrec):GOTO 540 
560 sortpointl%(testrec)=rec: NEXT: RETURN 
570 IF sortpointr%(testrec) THEN 

testrec=sortpointr%(testrec): 

GOTO 540 

580 sortpointr%(testrec) =rec: NEXT: RETURN 
690 REM Read a record and initialize the 
search 

700 INPUT#o1,slist%(rec);a$:sort$(rec) = 

MID$(a$,b,ln):PRlNT"."; 
710 sortpointl%(rec)=z:sortpointr%(rec) = 

z:testrec=o1 
720 RETURN 

Notice that a subroutine at hne 700 is 
actually used to read the data and construct the 
sort key. This is done to simplify changing the 
program to fit other data or file structures. Line 
710 sets the current locations in the pointer ar- 
rays to zero and sets the initial test record to 
one, since testing always begins at the top of the 
tree. 

Note also the use of real variables z and o 1 
here. Not only is it faster to use variables than it 
is to use integer constants, but since Basic's ex- 
pression evaluator works with real numbers and 
converts to integers only when doing the as- 
signment to the integer variable, it is faster to 
use real number variables for the assignment. 
Using z%, for example, would require Basic to 
convert z% to a real number ("float" it) and 
then convert that quantity back to an integer 
("fix" it) for assignment. Now you know. 

After getting the value into sort$, lines 540 
through 580 scan the binary tree structure for 
the appropriate place for the value. Note the 
double use of the next statement. Executing 
either statement will take the next value in the 
loop and eliminates the need to execute a goto. 
Because it is impossible to know which next will 
be executed last, both need to be followed by re- 
turn statements. It's a good idea to study the ac- 
tion of this routine with the binary tree data 
example given earlier, to be sure you follow 
what is happening. 

After the tree structure is built, the routine 
at line 800 decodes it and builds the sorted 



pointer array parray%. That routine looks like 
this: 

800 parray%(0) = slist%(0) 

810 recpntr= O:stackpointer= 0:rec = 1 

820 IF sortpointl%{rec) THEN stackpointer= 

stackpointer+ol :stack% 

(stackpointer)=rec:rec= 

sortpointl%(rec):GOTO 820 
830 recpntr = recpntr+o1 :parray%(recpntr) = 

slist%(rec) 
840 IF sortpointr%(rec) THEN rec= 

sortpointr%(rec):GOTO 820 
850 IF stackpointer THEN rec=stack% 

(stackpointer):stackpointer= 

stackpointer-oliGOTO 830 
860 RETURN 

Notice how this routine duplicates the algo- 
rithm we studied earlier. First, it works its way 
down the left side of the tree, saving records on 
the stack as it goes. When the left-hand point- 
ers finally run out, that record becomes the first 
entry in the list (line 830), and the right side of 
that branch is checked (line 840). If right 
branches have also run out, the routine exits 
one level up, takes the top value off the stack 
(line 850), decrements the stack pointer, and 
puts that record in the list (back at line 830). 
Then the process continues until all values are 
exhausted and the return is taken at line 860. 
This one is worth working through too! 

To B-tree or Not To B-tree. Well, that con- 
cludes our look this time at binary sort tech- 
niques and binary trees. Next month we'll look 
at how to use this technique to create an access 
method that has several advantages over our 
hash algorithm from a previous episode. It's 



worth noting that variations on the binary tree 
scheme are the basis for sophisticated access 
methods on large machines. 

The Apple III Record Processing Services 
package uses a highly modified version of this 
technique as the basis for its eight-key access 
method. It's described as "highly modified" be- 
cause the routine just given, while fast and effi- 
cient for most data, has a severe problem when 
confronted with data that is already sorted, or 
nearly sorted. This is because the tree works 
best (needs the fewest compares) when it is rela- 
tively balanced; that is, when the data is in ran- 
dom order and thus falls to the left and right 
branches relatively equally. If the data is read in 
in sorted order, the result is a very long linked 
list, since each value will be greater than the one 
prior to it and the lists will consist of all right 
pointers. 

There are techniques for balancing trees to 
solve this problem, but they were left out this 
time for simplicity. One technique completely 
outside the usual approaches is to modify the 
routine in line 700 to do pseudorandom reads of 
the data, perhaps simply starting at the middle 
and alternating left and right until the records 
are all read. Anyway, try some things out and 
see what you think. The Jmkfile program will 
allow all the practice at using this routine that 
you can stand. 

UnUl next month, then, tell your friends 
that you can't leave the house because you're 
too busy climbing trees. That'll perplex 'em for 
a while! M

Tools of the Craft, Part 18 

The perceptive reader of last month's column surely noticed the ab- 
sence of the customary programming challenge. Instead of being en- 
joined to design and write the routines IntToString and Goodlnteger, 
you were merely encouraged to give them a try. Do not think for a mo- 
ment that this implies a lack of confidence in your competence! How- 
ever, good programming is a slow process, and the careful building of 
tools such as Goodlnteger and IntToString may easily require more free 
time than you have. 

Full-time students of computer programming at our colleges and uni- 
versities are not only permitted but often required to spend most of their 
waking hours in communion with their machines. Fortunately, they soon 
discover that bending a computer to one's will produces a unique eu- 
phoria, the pursuit of which justifies any and all time and effort that is re- 
quired for success. 

Like the full-time programming students, you may also know the joys 
of "programmer's high." Unlike them, however, you probably have very 
little time to spend on the Pascal Path, what with your responsibilities to 
work, school, and family (not to mention those holiday preparations)! 
There's certainly no dishonor in waiting for the "official" set of conver- 
sion routines. If you were successful in developing your own, so much 
the better! Still, we'll look carefully at the versions shown here, analyz- 
ing their methodologies and style. If you wrote your own routines, you 
should make a special point of comparing yours to these. 

Here, then, is the latest edition of Cable, including complete copies of 
NewTown, IntToString, and Goodlnteger

Out of Thin Air. Besides the data-converson routines, whicii we'll 
examine momentarily, there are two other new global objects in the list- 
ing just given: the String constant Empty and the function SkipBlanks. 
As we work more and more with String variables, we'll tend to use the 
empty string about as often as the blank character, if prior experience is 
any indication of the future. To improve readabihty of programs that use 
the empty string frequently, we'll use the identifier Empty to stand for 
that constant. Of course, we must declare Empty in a CONST section, 
and it seems wisest to do so in the global area. This way, the constant 
may be used in all parts of the program. 

The definition of Goodlnteger stipulates that the routine ignore 
blanks that precede the character representation of an Integer. The code 
that accomplishes this could have been made part of the body of Good- 
Integer, but it is implemented here as a separate function, Skip- 
Blanks. Why? 

Pascal's facilities for defining procedures and functions give the lazy 
programmer an excellent opportunity to avoid a great deal of future 
drudgery by investing a small amount of time and thought when build- 
ing software. Any good programmer (especially a lazy one) develops an 
instinct for recognizing parts of a program that might be useful in future 
projects. 

Acting on that instinct, such a programmer establishes these parts as 
self-contained procedures or functions that can be extracted from the 
current program and dropped into another one without undue diffi- 
culty. Eventually, after building up a "library" of such routines, a pro- 
grammer will find that the major portion of many an important pro- 
gram is already written — all that is necessary is to assemble the proper 
"standard" parts. You'll develop the "tool builder's" instinct much more 
quickly if you resolve, this very moment, always to look for and isolate 
the "universal" routines that are sure to be a part of every program you 
write. In Cable, one such routine is SkipBlanks. You can see that this 
function is required by Goodlnteger. If you think about the definition of 
a street address, you can also see that "leading blanks" should be toler- 
ated before a StreetName. Thus, the function performed by SkipBlanks 
is useful not only to the routine that recognizes an Integer, but also the 
one that recognizes a StreetName. Rather than replicate redundant code 
at several spots within a program, it is usually better to implement that 
code as a general tool, in the form of a procedure or function, as was 
done here with SkipBlanks. 

Anatomy Lesson: SkipBlanks. SkipBlanks takes two VAR param- 
eters: the String S and the Integer SP ("String Pointer"). Under normal 
circumstances, SP will contain an Integer number not less than one and 
not greater than Length(S). In other words, SP will normally be an in- 
dex into a legal character position within S. It's very possible, however, 
that the initial content of SP could be an illegal index, so SkipBlanks 
niust be capable of dealing with this situation, also. The first thing 
SkipBlanks does is remember the starting SP value by storing it in the lo- 
cal variable OriginalSP. Then, a WHILE-loop is used to increment SP, 
so long as it still refers to a blank character position. 

In writing the loop, you might have been tempted to use "S[SP] = 
Blank", instead of"Copy(S, SP, 1) = Blank" as the continuation condi- 
tion. Unfortunately, the nature of the WHILE-loop would ensure that 
executing SkipBlanks would often result in a "value range error" at run-

time, and hence, contribute to the untimely abortion of your program! 
To see why, consider the situation where the initial content of SP is great- 
er than Length(S). (The simplest instance of this would perhaps be if S 
contained the empty string; then, any value contained by SP would be 
out of range.) Under these circumstances, the character position S[SP] 
does not logically exist and thus cannot be accessed! Any attempt to use 
the expression S[SP] causes the Pascal system to reject the access, abort 
the program, and complain of a value range error. In other words, the in- 
dex "value" (SP) has exceeded the bounds of its permissible "range" (1 to 
Length(S)). This same problem would present itself when all the charac- 
ter positions from S[SP] to S[Length(S)] are blank. In this case, even if SP 
is initially within range, it eventually becomes just one greater than 
Length(S), as a result of the action of the WHILE-loop. Use of the ex- 
pression S[SP] at this point would also cause a value range error. 

To avoid all these complications, the WHILE-loop in SkipBlanks 
tests against a single-character substring of S, constructed using the Copy 
function. Remember that the constant Blank may be taken as either a 
Char value or a single-character String, given the ambiguities between 
Char and String types that we discussed last month. So, it's just as valid 
to compare Blank with Copy(S, SP, 1) as to the more dangerous S[SP]. 
Copy is safer to use here than Char-array indexing, because it returns the 
empty string when SP is not within the proper range. The empty string is 
clearly not Blank, so the continuation condition for the WHILE-loop al- 
ways makes sense, and there is never any danger of causing a value range 
error. 

Now that you understand SkipBlanks, here's a thorny question for 
you: how would you write the routine's complement, SkipNonBlanks? 
It's not quite as simple as changing the function name and substituting a 
<> for the = in the original WHILE-loop continuation condition! 
Do you know why? 

More Conversions: IntToString. The initial comments for IntTo- 
String, as given in the listing of Cable, sum up the behavior of this proce- 
dure and need not be repeated. Here, we're interested in examining the 
routine's interior in order to understand how the plain-language func- 
tional specification has been translated into working Pascal code. 

When we developed IntegerOutput, several months ago, we were 
forced to display leftmost characters before rightmost ones. This meant 
that we had to scan the Source once before display in order to determine 
the leftmost digit position, and so the starting point for the display scan. 
In IntToString, we do away with the need for this preliminary scan by us- 
ing the local String variable TDest as a repository for the character rep- 
resentation of Source. This frees us to build TDest, digit by digit, scan- 
ning in the easiest direction: from the least significant (rightmost) digit of 
Source, to the most significant (leftmost) one. To illustrate, IntegerOut- 
put would display the digits of the number 12,345 in order: 1, 2, 3, 4, and, 
finally, 5, by virtue of its left-to-right scan. IntToString, on the other 
hand, scans right-to-left and would build up TDest as '5', '45', '345', 
'2345', and, finally '12345'. Of course, it doesn't matter at all whether 
TDest is constructed backward, forward, or sideways, since only the fi- 
nal, correct value will ever be used to modify Dest. 

IntToString Observed. Rather than launch into a theoretical dissec- 
tion of IntToString, let's take the role of the P-machine and "execute" 
IntToString for a representative example. That is, we'll simulate the pro- 
cedure's execution by hand, using pencil and paper to keep track of the 
parameters and local variables as they change. Suppose, upon entry to 
IntToString, that Source contains —237, Dest contains the string value 
'The Answer is: ', MinFW contains 5, and LPad contains Blank. 

The first thing IntToString does is empty TDest, readying it for sub- 
sequent computation. Next, Source is checked for negativity. If Source is 
negative, then the special, one-character String, Sign (declared as a local 
variable), acquires the value of the "minus sign"; otherwise, it is set 
empty. Note that any negative Source is converted to positive before any 
more operations are performed upon it because it is easier to isolate in- 
dividual characters from a positive Source than from a negative one. 
Furthermore, since Source is a value parameter, its value can be changed 
without affecting anything in the external environment; the conversion of 
Source from negative to positive is a "safe" one. In our specific example. 
Source is indeed negative, so Sign contains -, and Source contains (posi- 
tive) 237 just before the REPEAT loop is executed. 



The essence of the REPEAT loop is simple: a single-character 
String — corresponding to the rightmost Source digit — is concatenated to 
the left side of TDest. Then, the corresponding digit is "sliced away" 
from Source. This process repeats until Source contains no more digits. 

If you remember IntegerOutput, it's easy to see that the assignment 
"Source : = Source DIV Radix" does the "slicing," but you may be a bit 
confused by the code just above it, which handles the digit conversion. 

In SkipBlanks, we used the ambiguity between Char and String to 
our advantage in order to write some compact, elegant code. In IntTo- 
String, however, that very same ambiguity is our nemesis. To be specific, 
we know how to convert an Integer digit to a Char value, but we cannot 
use the Concat function to add a Char value to an existing String, since 
Concat accepts only String values as arguments. In IntToString, we work 
around this limitation by first concatenating Blank (a legal String) to the 
left side of TDest. We may then turn around and treat TDest as a Char 
array, accessing the place-holding blank on the left side as TDest[l]. 
Since TDest[l] is of type Char, we may apply our standard digit-to-Char 
conversion expression to it. 

To summarize, we add a "dummy blank" to the left side of TDest with 
the assignment "TDest : = Concat(Blank, TDest)." Then, we convert the 
rightmost digit in Source to a character, playing it on the leftmost side of 
TDest, with "TDest [1] := Chr(Ord('0') -I- (Source MOD Radix))." Fi- 
nally, we "slice away" Source's rightmost digit with "Source := Source 
DIV Radix." 

In our example, TDest is initially empty. In the first REPEAT-loop 
iteration, a blank is concatenated to the empty string and is subsequent- 
ly replaced by the digit '7'. After "slicing," Source contains 23, which is 
nonzero, so the loop iterates a second time. Another blank is placed on 
the left-hand side of TDest, and is then replaced by the digit '3'. Next, 
Source is "sliced" again. 

Now, at the end of the second iteration, TDest contains '37' and 
Source contains 2. Because Source is still nonzero, the loop body must be 
executed yet a third time. After this third sequence of "concatenate, con- 
vert, and slice," TDest contains '237' and Source contains 0, so the ter- 
mination condition for the REPEAT-loop finally holds. 

After the REPEAT-loop, the Sign of the original Source is added to 
the left side of TDest. In this case, the value of Sign is -. Had the origi- 
nal source been positive, the empty string would have been concatenated 
to TDest at this point, leaving Dest unchanged. 

Next, IntToString must "pad" TDest on the left, using the pattern in 
LPad so long as Length(TDest) is less than the minimum field width, 
MinFW. Since TDest is only four characters long in our example and 
MinFW is 5, some padding is indeed required. Note that the IF state- 
ment that guards the "padding" loop not only checks to see if padding is 
needed, it also determines if padding is safe. This is necessary because the 
"padding" loop checks Length(TDest) to determine when no more pad- 
ding is required on the assumption that, with every concatenation of 
LPad to TDest, the length of TDest will increase. If this assumption is in- 
valid — if, for instance, LPad is empty — the "padding" loop will never 
terminate and the program using IntToString will freeze, dead in its 
tracks, until the user resets the Apple! To avoid this nasty occurrence, 
IntToString ensures that LPad indeed contains at least one character be- 
fore trying to use it in padding TDest. 

With TDest equal to '-237' upon entering the "padding" loop, only 
one loop iteration is necessary to satisfy the minimum field-width re- 
quirement. Finally, TDest contains ' -237'. 

There is no law that says the "padding" pattern need be only a single 
character (although this is what usually happens in practice). Suppose 
LPad had contained [ ] instead of a Blank. Still, exactly one iteration of 
the "padding" loop would have occurred, but the resulting TDest would 
have been longer than the specified minimum field width. IntToString 
was written on the assumption that, should the character representation 
of Source actually need padding in order to satisfy the minimum field 
width, the final string should not exceed that specified length. On the 
other hand, if the length of the unpadded representation meets or ex- 
ceeds the minimum, no padding is necessary and TDest remains unmo- 
lested. To ensure that the minimum field width is not exceeded when 
padding has occurred, TDest is truncated to the specified length imme- 
diately after the "padding" loop by means of the Copy function. Look

carefully at the parameters used in this call to Copy. In general, so long as 
any arbitrary String MyString is guaranteed to contain at least n charac- 
ters, you may use the function call: 

Copy(MyString, Length(MyString) - n + 1, n) 
to extract the n rightmost characters. (What happens if MyString con- 
tains less than n characters? Take a guess, then write a small program to 
test your hypothesis!) You can see that excess padding characters on the 
left of TDest are sliced away and discarded. This makes sense; if we trun- 
cated on the right, we would often throw away one or more of the digits 
of the converted Integer! 

Finally, TDest is fully constructed, including all digits, a minus sign, 
and the required padding. In this instance, TDest now contains ' —237'. 
At its exit, IntToString concatenates TDest to Dest, leaving the value 
'The answer is: —237' in Dest. Note that there are two blanks between 
the colon and the minus sign. The first was part of the original Dest, 
while the second exists because of IntToString's padding activity. 

When IntToString Fails. There is only one situation in which Int- 
ToString will fail to do its duty, and that is when the padded character 
representation of Source is too long to fit on the right-hand end of Dest. 
For instance, suppose that Length(Dest) is 76 on entry to the roudne and 
that Length(TDest) is 5 on exit. Remember, that the type String is equi- 
valent to String[80], meaning that any such variable can contain no more 
than eighty characters. At the end of IntToString, the String produced by 
Concat(Dest, TDest) will have a length of 81! This value is too long to fit 
into Dest, and the program using IntToString in this case aborts with a 
"string overflow error." 

Unfortunately, it's impossible, using the unadulterated Apple Pascal 
language, for the routine to guard itself against this all-too-likely situa- 
tion. IntToString must be written and used in the optimistic belief that 
the concatenation of TDest to Dest will not overflow the memory space 
allocated to Dest. This assumpdon holds in the case of Cable (in its cur- 
rent incarnation) but may be overly naive in other situadons. When these 
conditions rear their misshapen heads we will deal with them, using 
sophisticated techniques that are best left unexplained for now. 

Note that a variation of the problem just described occurs when the 
actual parameter corresponding to Dest has not been initialized proper- 
ly, before the call to IntToString. Then, that variable holds arbitrary gar- 
bage, which could quite possibly appear to the P-machine as a String 
value that is too long (or almost too long) to be contained by Dest. In 
this case, the final concatenation of TDest to Dest would also cause a 
string overflow, to the mysdficadon and frustradon of all concerned. 
You've heard it before, but it's worth repeadng when using IntTo- 
String, it is your serious responsibility to ensure that no uninidalized 
String variables are used as parameters. 

Goodlnteger. One of the more complex routines we've yet devel- 
oped, Goodlnteger is based on the concept of "all or nothing." To be 
more specific, its operation produces either complete, correct results (and 
a True function value) or no results at all (other than a Boolean funcdon 
value of False). If Goodlnteger finds the character representadon of a 
valid Integer constant in S, beginning at position SP, then the corres- 
ponding Integer is returned in Dest, and SP is updated to refer to the 
character posidon that comes just after the Integer sequence. Thus, SP 
could conceivably acquire a value that is one greater than the length of S, 
provided that the Integer sequence scanned by Goodlnteger extends 
through the last character in S. If it doesn't find a valid literal represen- 
tadon, it leaves both Dest and SP untouched. 

In order to exhibit "all or nothing" behavior, Goodlnteger must 
work with "provisional" copies of SP and Dest during the scan of S; 
these are the local variables TSP and TDest. The routine must also main- 
tain a Boolean variable, SyntaxOK, which contains the status of the scan 
at any point. If, at the end of the scan, SyntaxOK is True, then the tem- 
porary values of TSP and TDest are placed into SP and Dest, respecdve- 
ly, and the funcdon value is likewise set True. A False value of Syntax- 
OK signals Goodlnteger to return a False function value without updat- 
ing the permanent values of SP and Dest. 

Getting a Good Integer. In order to illustrate Goodlnteger's opera- 
don more effecdvely, let's again assume the role of the P-machine and 
execute the routine. Assume that, on entry, S contains 'The answer 
is: -237' and that SP contains 16. The initial content of Dest is irrelevant. 



To initialize the scanning process, SyntaxOK is set False, and TSP is 
set to the value of SP. Throughout the scan, TSP, and SP, will be the 
"string pointer." Only if everything turns out all right will the content of 
SP be updated. 

At the beginning of the scan, leading blanks are skipped by means of 
a call to SkipBlanks. TSP goes into SkipBlanks with the value of 16 (one 
position before the minus sign) and comes out containing 17. The func- 
don value returned by SkipBlanks — in this case, 1 — is ignored, since we 
really don't care how many blanks are skipped. (In future routines, how- 
ever, we may be very concerned about this, so it's a good thing that Skip- 
Blanks returns this informadon to us; the number of blanks skipped may 
be superfluous now, and it may be a bother to ignore it, but it is better to 
be able to ignore this information now and use it later than not to have 
it at all!) 

Next, we determine whether the Integer is positive or negative. As we 
did in IntToString, we use Copy to extract a single-character substring 
from S, rather than using array indexing to acquire a Char value in or- 
der to avoid value range errors. And what if TSP is out of range? Right! 
SignChar receives the empty string, rather than the single-character sub- 
string we expect it to get. Since, in this instance, TSP contains 1 7, and this 
refers to a legal character position, SignChar acquires the value of that 
character position, the minus sign. 

Note that there is nothing forcing us to declare or use the single-char- 
acter String variable SignChar here. Everywhere we use SignChar, we 
could subsdtute the function call "Copy(S, TSP, 1)". That, however, 
would make the program wordier and perhaps less easy to read. Less ap- 
parent, it takes more time for the P-machine to evaluate the call to Copy 
than it does to fetch the value stored in SignChar. So, SignChar contrib- 
utes to both the readability and the execudon speed of Goodlnteger 
without costing us much in terms of extra code or storage space. 

The Boolean variable Sign is set True, since SignChar contains — . 
Had the sequence started with any other character, the design of the as- 
signment to Sign ensures that this variable would have been set to False. 
Since the literal begins with a sign character (in this case, "minus"), we

must increment TSP and so move past the sign in order to begin scan- 
ning the digits. TSP now holds the value of 18. 

At the start of the digit scan, TDest is set to 0. Next comes a 
WHILE-loop that is ver\' reminiscent of the one we wrote for Integerln- 
put some months ago. For the third time, we use the Copy function so as 
to avoid value range errors. One of Apple Pascal's interesting anomalies 
is that single-character Strings compare exactly, as do Char values, but 
they cannot be compared with Char values! In our WHILE-loop's con- 
tinuation condition, the literals '0' and '9' are treated as Strings, because 
they are compared with values returned by the String function. Copy. 

After the body of the WHILE-loop has been executed at least once, 
Goodlnteger has found a valid character representation of an Integer lit- 
eral, so the first thing done in the body is to set SyntaxOK to True. Next, 
w e build up TDest. using the "shift and add" technique pioneered in In- 
tegerlnput. Finally, we increment TSP, so as to be looking at the next 
character position during the next loop iteration. Remember, at the be- 
ginning of the loop, TSP contains a value of 18. Copy(S, TSP, l)is there- 
fore '2', which is definitely within the range of *0' to '9'. Consequently, 
the loop body is executed for the first time. SyntaxOK is set True, the 
current value of TDest is replaced by the old value times ten (remember, 
zero times ten is still zero!), plus the Integer value of the current digit, 2. 
TSP is incremented to 19. 

At the end of the first iteration, TDest holds the value 2. Copy(S, 
TSP, 1 ) is now '3' — again a digit character — so the loop body is executed 
again. Once more, SyntaxOK is set True. Granted, this assignment to 
SyntaxOK within the loop is redundant after the first iteration, but it 
doesn't hurt anything, and we can't really avoid it. Next TDest is up- 
dated to contain the value (2 * 10) + 3, or 23, and TSP is incremented to 



20, marking the end of the second iteration. Copy(S, TSP, 1) is now '7' 
and another redundant assignment to SyntaxOK occurs. TDest be- 
comes (23 * 10) + 7, or 237. And, at the end of the third iteration, TSP 
becomes 21 . Now, Copy(S, TSP, 1) returns the empty string, since TSP is 
21 and Length(S) is only 20. The WHILE-loop continuation condition 
fails, since the empty string compares as less than '0', and the loop 
terminates. 

Once past the digit-scanning loop, Goodlnteger sets its own function 
value equal to SyntaxOK, which is True for our example. And since the 
routine was successful in recognizing an Integer literal, TDest and TSP 
are made permanent by being assigned to Dest and SP, respectively. It is 
at this time that Goodlnteger remembers to adjust Dest for proper sign, 
based on the value of the Boolean variable Sign. All of its business hav- 
ing been completed, Goodlnteger now terminates with a function value 
of True. Dest contains the Integer value —237, and SP contains 21. 

Parting Shots. Once upon a time, this month's itinerary included the 
complete examination of DisplayTown and even of ChangeTown. But, 
of course, as you can see, presenting and explaining even the rudimen- 
tary data conversion routines has taken up the entire space. 

In order to speed discussion of the remaining code in Cable and fin- 
ish it all next time, we'll let the program listing do most of the talking. 
This will pose no difficulty for you as long as you study, and thoroughly 
understand, the principles behind SkipBlanks, IntToString, and Goodln- 
teger. In particular, you should spend some more time as the P-machine, 
simulating the execution of all three routines, especially for bizarre cases 
of input data. For instance, what happens when you feed the empty 
string to Goodlnteger?

The middle-aged patient in Room 723 was 
as typical as he was special. He was among the 
ten million Americans who suffer from asthma, 
but he had it in a bad way. What is for most 
people a mild and easily controlled respiratory 
disease was for this man a crippler — an acute, 
chronic lung disorder that literally left him gasp- 
ing for air. 

Common allergic asthmas are treated by 
pediatricians and family practitioners as a part 
of the regular routine, but this was a nonaller- 
gic variety that could only be controlled with so- 
phisticated drugs. Which is why, on the day in 
question, pharmacist Martin Lefkowitz was re- 
viewing the patient's prescription chart on the 
screen of his Apple III. 

"We don't get the Primatene Mist cases 
here," says Lefkowitz, pharmacy director for 
the National Jewish Hospital/National Asthma 
Center in mile-high Denver. 

Reviewing prescriptions is a routine part of 
Lefkowdtz's job, but there was nothing routine 
in the data on the patient in Room 723. Pre- 
scriptions of theophylline, a muscle relaxant 
that frees up constricted air passages, were vary- 
ing significantly as the doctor, a physician in 
training, tried to stabilize the patient. The doc- 
tor was altering quantities and timed-release 
formulas in an effort to find the optimum blood 
level of the drug — a level that was both safe and 
effective. "He was looking for the therapeutic 
window," Lefkowitz recalls, "but he wasn't 
finding it." 

A Delicate Balance. Rocketing a missile 
through its earthly escape window requires 
numerous mathematical calculations. So does 
figuring proper drug dosages for asthma pa- 
tients. Age, asthmatic history, drug metabolism 
rate, and lung efficiency all interact in framing 
the window. A physician can locate the open- 
ing by trial and error, of course — altering medi- 
cations one at a time, then measuring effects by 
taking blood samples. This method yields 



results — usually within two or three days — but 
it's a trial that both patient and care facility can 
do without. 

"The fewer times you have to draw blood, 
the better the patient likes you and the quicker 
his course through the hospital," says Lefko- 
witz. 

The quicker way is made possible today 
through the VisiCalc of pharmacology — a so- 
phisticated drug dosing program that lets the 
computer suffer the trials and errors of window 
shopping. Factor in the standard variables, hit a 
control key, and voila! An S-shaped curve ap- 
pears on the screen, a linear regression-type 
mathematical model upon which the therapeu- 
tic windows for a series of "what-if questions 
posed by the pharmacist are instantly calcu- 
lated. What if he increases the dosage? What if 
he lowers it? And what if he gives more medi- 
cation but in a slower, time-released form? 

The accumulation, dissipation and move- 
ment of drugs in the body follow certain math- 
ematical rules, but those rules are not of the 
two-plus-two, household variety. More can 
often mean less in this pharmacokinetic world. 

"There comes a point where twice as much 
drug doesn't do twice as much good," explains 
Lefkowitz. "By knowing where the flat portion 
of the S-curve is, we know the safe range. Go 
beyond it and you run the risk of making the 
patient toxic. At the very least, that leads to 
nausea and vomiting, and at the very worst, to 
convulsions and respiratory arrest where you 
have to take heroic measures to keep the pa- 
tient alive." 

Computer Consultant. Computers, those 
master number crunchers, were made for this 
kind of logarithmic drudge work. They have 
raised proper patient dosing from an expensive 
art to an efficient science. In 80 percent of cases, 
says Leflcowitz, a program he wrote has pin- 
pointed the therapeutic window. 

Which is why, on the day in question, he 



308 



DECEMBER 1982 



was at the looking glass of his Apple III scruti- 
nizing the prescription chart for the patient in 
Room 723. 

A hospital pharmacist today does more 
than pay homage to the four verities — count- 
ing, pouring, licking, and sticking. He or she is a 
licensed professional whose hospital role is 
expanding in an era in which soaring health care 
costs are coupled with the development of allied 
and para-health professions. Whenever physi- 
cians alter their patients' drug regimens, to- 
day's activist pharmacists don't just fill the 
orders, they review them. 

"We're becoming more highly visible," says 
Leflcowitz. "We make rounds. We see the doc- 
tor's patient as our patient, too, so we now exer- 
cise the prerogative to comment and consult on 
the therapy a patient is under as far as drugs 
are concerned." 

On a routine level, that has meant refusing 
to accept drug orders from physicians that 
vaguely advise the patient to take "as directed" 
or "as needed." "A month from now, the pa- 
tient could have three or four different drugs in 
his medicine cabinet, all labeled 'as needed,' " 
says Lefkowitz. "At two o'clock in the morn- 
ing, you want explicit directions." 

And when a physician-in-training varies or- 
ders for theophylline without therapeutic ef- 
fect, today's pharmacist takes his cue. Which is 
what Leflcowitz did after reviewing the chart on 
the patient in Room 723. He dispatched an as- 
sistant pharmacist to introduce the young physi- 
cian to the marvels of computer model making.

The assistant pharmacist's mission was to 
confer with the doctor and present him with the 
very antithesis of the doctor's handwritten pre- 
scription — a legible report. Coming up with 
such a report was a matter of dumping the 
model dosage data into a text file and watching 
the department's word cruncher, the Word Jug- 
gler word processor from Quark Engineering, 
type and format an easy-to-follow memo. 

"You just don't give a doctor a bunch of 
numbers," says Lefkowitz. "You add them up." 

Information Inventory. A hospital phar- 
macist is only as good as what he knows and 
what he has on the shelf, and nearly every year 
he's asked to increase his stocks of both. 

"We not only dispense drugs, we dispense 
information," says Lefkowitz. "Very few 
departments within a hospital deal with as 
many different people as we do." 

In addition to monitoring patient drug use 
and progress, Lefkowitz inventories two thou- 
sand special medications, constantly ufxlates 
data on drug interactions for dissemination 
among the hospital staff, creates bibliographies 
of medical articles, answers inquiries from doc- 
tors and pharmacists across the country, and 
prints drug lists setting ground rules for pre- 
scription ordering. Then, of course, he pub- 
lishes a newsletter, generates reports for Uncle 
Sam on experimental drug testing, and, if he 
hasn't hyperventilated in the interim, finds time 
to handle the normal administrative chores of 
budget preparation and staff scheduling. 

"All this," he says with noteworthy under- 
statement, "is too much to keep in one head." 

In matters of information storage and rapid 
retrieval, two heads are better than one, 
especially when one is a computer. This bit of 
contemporary technological wisdom seized the 
hospital imagination two-plus years ago, but 
not with stellar results — at least not at first. 

Given the size of the hospital — one hun- 
dred beds and a staff of one thousand — the ad- 
ministration elected to go with a dedicated word 
processor. "I'd rather not mention the name," 
Lefkowitz confides soto voce, "because I haven't 
anything nice to say about it." 

When it worked, it worked, but that was 
more at its pleasure than that of the pharmacy 
director. 

'The downtime always occurred when we 
wanted to meet a deadline or when we were in 
the middle of writing a paper and the printer 
was off Besides, they shut the thing off every 
day at 4:30." 

Lefkowitz and company — four other phar- 
macists, two assistants, and a secretary — were 
gradually sinking in the flotsam and jetsam of 
the information explosion. Something clearly 
had to be done; so Lefkowitz, who had been a 
member of the hospital committee that had 
looked into dedicated word processors, began 
to investigate the possibilities of a microcom- 
puter for his department. 

In April of 1981, the only microcomputer 
powerful enough to meet his needs for data 
processing, budget preparation, and dosage 
modeling was the problem-plagued Apple III, 
which had been released late the previous year 



to mixed reviews. 

"Quite frankly, I bought the machine more 
on a lick and a promise," Leflcowitz now con- 
cedes. "They had a nice brochure." 

The nice brochure offered purchasers a ver- 
sion of the top-selling VisiCalc, the existing li- 
brary of Apple II programs compatible with the 
III, and the prospect of a word processor, called 
Word Painter. The latter eventually emerged as 
Apple Writer III, but eventually did Lefkowitz 
no good at the time. Without a word cruncher, 
Lefkowitz was little more than the disgruntled 
owner of a glorified Apple II. 

"I was very pleased with VisiCalc, and I 
never had any of the hardware problems that 
other people seemed to have with the III. My 
problem was that they didn't come through 
with all the software they promised." 

Rescue by Remote Resource. As luck 
would have it, relief was just around the comer. 
Leftkowitz had invested in a modem to link the 
department with the Source and other data- 
bases, and that investment paid off handsome- 
ly when he spotted a listing on the Source for 
Word Juggler, an Apple III word processor. 
According to the listing, the program was 
manufactured and distributed by Quark Engi- 
neering, right there in Denver, a scant mile from 
the hospital. 

Word Juggler wasn't just the only word 
processor available for his Apple. Says Lefko- 
witz, borrowing a phrase, it polished it. 

"Quark is one software company that's said, 
'We're going to automate the office,' " 
Lefkowitz crows. As he sees it, Quark believes 
in one-stop data processing and report genera- 
tion — in a word processor that can juggle data 
and reports in and out of various programs all 
at one work station. 

"I'd like to have one system and have it do 
everything. It's sort of a supermarket philoso- 
phy. When you go into a supermarket or de- 
partment store nowadays, you can get a law- 
yer, a dentist, or oil for your car. You can even 
get your prescriptions filled." 

Leflcowitz's basic prescription for word 
processing was simple enough. He wanted a sys- 
tem that was so easy to use that novices could 
be typing documents an hour after being intro- 
duced to the program, whether they cracked the 
manual or not. 

Special templates or overlays that label fre- 
quently used editing, formatting, and print keys 
make this possible, according to Lefkowitz. A 
single keystroke previews the document print 
format, while a horizontal scrolling feature 
permits the viewing of files up to 254 columns 
wide. 

If further text changes are required, a single 
keystroke returns the user to the edit mode in 
the vicinity of the desired change. A single key- 
stroke also initiates printing, with secondary op- 
tions available for doing specific pages and mul- 
tiple copies. 

The department also has a hard disk sys- 
tem. Lefkowitz likens it to a giant filing cabinet 
with a seemingly endless capacity for mixing 
and matching subsections and file folders. "You 
can create subdirectories on any storage device 



310 



DECEMBER 1982 



in the SOS operating system," he maintains. 
"Whether it's a text file or a data file, Word 
Juggler can pull it out and incorporate it in a 
document you're working on. 

"You have no idea how useful that is when 
you have the data already. It gives you the 
option of pulling something out of VisiCalc and 
either printing it, inserting it into another docu- 
ment, or turning it into an addendum. You don't 
have to retype what you've already done, and 
when you're saddled with science papers and re- 
views, having a word processor is golden." 

This is particularly true when the satisfied 
customer continues to find other office chores 
for his electronic amanuensis. When Lefkowitz 
summons, his faithful machine mate uncom- 
plainingly churns out the drudge work: the 
management, government, and pharmacolog- 
ical reports; the reviews and scientific abstracts; 
the form letters and bibliographies; and the life- 
blood of his department — hospital drug lists, 
which it thoughtfully sorts by category. 

Using his thirty thousand-word Quark Lexi- 
check speller program, Lefkowitz has also been 
able to root out the egregious typos and create 
an eight thousand-word pharmacy lexicon 
that's crammed with medical terms, drug com- 
pany monikers, and the titled names of very im- 
portant persons. 

"Lexicheck is one of the fastest spellers I've 
seen," marvels Lefkowitz. "It can scan docu- 
ments for misspellings at the rate of ten thou- 
sand words per minute — fourteen thousand if 



the dictionary is stored on a hard disk." 

Interrupted Print and Intermixed Pro- 
grams. And now, as they say on the midway. 
Quark has two new auxiliary programs 
that Lefkowitz is eager to exploit — a spooler 
called Discourse and a master hard disk pro- 
gram called Catalyst. With the spooler, Lefko- 
witz can print a series of files (as many as four- 
teen at one time) and still use his Apple for other 
tasks. This is possible because the printer out- 
put can be rapidly written to the spooler disk 
rather than being printed. Its only drawback for 
Lefkowitz is that it doesn't work with his 
Silentype. 

Catalyst, on the other hand, promises to 
take the Hoppiness out of disks. In a sense, it lets 
Apple III users put all their programs in one 
hard disk basket. 

"It's the finest piece of software I've seen 
around," declares Lefkowitz. Programs can be 
formatted onto a hard disk via Catalyst and easily 
loaded from a main menu by executing a simple 
key sequence. 

With so much going for it, can Word 
Juggler be that software oddity — the faultless 
program? Not quite. The sophisticated pro- 
gram, though contained on a single disk, oc- 
cupies a large chunk of memory. And even 
booster Lefkowitz is bothered by the limit of 
1,750 lines of text per file. He has 256K; the 
limit is virtually half that on a 128K system. 

The line restriction is a program short- 
coming but it isn't fatal, according to the phar-

macist. It can be easily overcome, he says, by 
linking files. Then, too, there's that quirk in the 
printer program, which has complicated the use 
of his Silentype. 

Like any user, Lefkowitz sees room for pro- 
gram enhancements, many of which are said to 
be in the mill. Automatic column formatfing 
and a math mode are particularly apjjealing. 

"The easiest way to do internal arithmetic 
now," he explains, "is to do your calculations in 
VisiCalc and then bring them back into Word 
Juggler." 

Leflcowitz the in-house publisher would also 
be mighty pleased if Quark would develop a 
double-column, side-by-side option that would 
permit design of a tabloid-style newsletter fea- 
turing columns of varying widths. And while 
we're on his wish list, mention should be made 
of his desire for a footnote-dragging feature that 
would automatically renumber said reference 
notes whenever he moves a block of text. 

"But what is really needed," he finally adds, 
"is for somebody to figure out a way to 
network the Ills to emulate a mainframe. That 
way you could have a number of terminals, all 
being able to use the same program." 

Pharmacist's Future. This final wish has 
been fed by a curious phenomenon — to wit, the 
Parkinson's law of word processing. "The use 
of our machine seems to expand with the hours 
the department is open," Lefkowitz observes. 
"Somebody always has something to do and we 
could definitely use more terminals." 

But if that is a reservation, it's a small one. 
Lefkowitz is firmly committed to the automated 
office, to the avowed national goal of paper- 
work reduction. If you're a believer, says he, 
you have to have faith in disks and not in paper. 
You can always generate a hard copy of what 
you really need. 

But just to let you know he's securely 
planted in Rocky Mountain soil, this keeper of 
two thousand specialized drugs shows he's lost 
neither his perspective nor his sense of humor. 

"We're waiting for the day when we have 
only two drugs on our shelves," he says. "One 
will cure everything, and the other will cure the 
side effects." 3

As usual, we'll discuss what equipment you 
need in order to run these packages and com- 
ment on some of their special features (or lack 
thereof). And, as usual, it's strongly recom- 
mended that you get acquainted with the com- 
mand structure of any programs you're con- 
sidering. What commands are available and 
how they are set up can make a real difference 
in how easy a program is to use and how ap- 
propriate it is for your particular needs. 
Super-Text 40/80. Muse Software, 347 North 
Charles Street, Baltimore, MD 21201; (301) 
659-7212. $175. 

Equipment required: 48K, lower-case adapter 
or Videx eighty-column board, one or two disk 
drives, monitor, printer. 

This program is very easy to use, and that's 
one of its major strengths. As its name implies, 
Super-Text 40/80 allows you to work in either 
forty or eighty column mode. There's an excel- 
lent earlier version of the program {Super-Text 
11), as well as a version called Super-Text 
40/56/80, which allows you to work in forty, 
fifty-six, or eighty columns. 

In this review, we'll focus on Super-Text 
40/80. This package offers lots of nice features. 
For example, there's a helpful count option that 
allows you to count how many characters, 
words, or paragraphs your document contains. 
If you're a person who does a lot of writing for 
publication, this should be a big plus. 

Some of Super-Text 40/80'% features are 
normally found only in so-called standalone 
word processors. You can, for instance, define 



what a given key might represent. Thus, if you 
have a phrase that you're using over and over 
again in a document, you can reenter that 
phrase in your document as many times as 
necessary by simply pressing a single key. This 
can, of course, be useful when you're creating 
and editing a document, but it can also be used 
in many list processing applications. If, for ex- 
ample, you were entering the names and ad- 
dresses of customers from a particular area into 
your system, a single keystroke could be used to 
enter Boston, Massachusetts (or any city/ state 
combination you'd specified), wherever needed. 

A math mode allows you to include fairly 
complex calculations within the documents you 
create. The built-in nine-digit floating point cal- 
culator performs on-screen calculations, does 
column totals, and can verify mathematical 
data that's placed within a document. Since 
many word processing applications in the busi- 
ness arena include tables of numbers, this is a 
very welcome feature. 

This system also includes the ability to 
transpose two letters that might accidentally 
have been typed in the wrong order (a very 
common problem for the average typist). 

Super-Text 40/80 also has a preview mode 
that allows you to see what your document will 
look like before you print it. Many word proc- 
essing packages don't offer this capability, and 
it can be bothersome, at best, not to know in ad- 
vance what your letter or document is going to 
look like on the printed page. For documents 
that are spread out over several disk files, Super- 




Now you can use computer technology to search the Bible on any subject. With 
THE WORD processor (including a disk copy of the complete KJV Bible text) you 
can create indexes on keywords. Or phrases. Even on concepts. 
A full spectrum of text search functions allows detailed analysis for the real stu- 
dent of the Bible.

Text 40/80 has an "autolink" feature that en- 
ables you to link all of your separate files to- 
gether. This can be very helpful when you're 
preparing a long document or linking together 
different parts of a document for various appli- 
cations (alternate versions of a legal document, 
for example). 

Word wrap is standard here, as it is in most 
word processing programs. Other characteris- 
tics of this program include a type-ahead buffer; 
the ability to copy, save, or delete blocks of text; 
and an easy-to-use "find and replace" option 
that even includes "wild card" selections. 

The Super-Text 40/80 manual is quite well 
organized and really helps the user get ac- 
quainted with all of the program's features. It is 
clear, easy to read, and appropriately illus- 
trated. The manual also contains instructions 
for modifying the keyboard (you can even get a 
modification chip from Muse). 

Muse also has a list processing package 
available that allows for merging a list of names 
and addresses with a document that's been pre- 
pared using Super-Text 40/80. Several of the 
more popular printers can be used to take ad- 
vantage of this option, and specific parameters 
are given in the manual for using Epson, 
Diablo, Centronics, NEC, and IDS for this 
purpose. 

Among Super-Text 40/80'% other features 
are the ability to control automatic tabbing, to 
position page numbers wherever you wish on 
the page, to center lines with ease, and to in- 
clude page headings and footers. A "split- 
screen" feature allows you to view two differ- 
ent portions of a document at the same time. If 
you're an author, you may also especially ap- 
preciate the program's superscripting and sub- 
scripting features, as well as the ability to or- 
ganize the document into chapters (with chap- 
ter relative page numbers). 

Be sure to look at all of the Super-Text se- 
ries of word processing packages before you 
make your final decision. The number of char- 
acters that will display on the screen is not the 
only difference in the three packages. For ex- 
ample, Super-Text 40/56/80 doesn't include the 
math mode or the split-screen feature. And it's 
slower than Super-Text II. Like Super-Text 
40/80. it includes a type-ahead feature, where 
the Super-Text II does not. 

Super-Text 40/56/80 also has a "character 
designer" option that lets you create characters 
of whatever variety you wish, including cursive 
characters, characters from a foreign language, 
or special symbols. And the fifty-six characters 
per line option was introduced as an "in-be- 
tween" size to address the complaint that 
eighty-character lines were too hard to read. It's 
definitely easier on the eyes. 

When it comes to the Super-Text packages, 
your choice is really between Super-Text 40/80 
and Super-Text 40/56/80. Is the size of the on- 
screen character important to you? Do you 
need the math mode? Is the split screen essen- 
tial? Once again, you must do your homework 
concerning your particular application needs. 
Only then will you be able to ask the right ques- 
tions and make the best decision.

DECEMBER 1982 



There are some drawbacks to Super-Text 
40/80. Some users report that it reacts more 
slowly than earlier versions did, although not to 
the extent that it's a problem. And in eighty-col- 
umn mode, the program is somewhat slower 
and a bit awkward to use. 

The maximum file size you can work with is 
just under fifteen thousand characters. This isn't 
all that large a file, but then we must remember 
that we're working with microcomputers. And, 
once you delete text, it's gone for good. Some 
other systems are more forgiving and keep track 
of your recent deletions, in case you change 
your mind. 

The files you create using Super-Text 40/80 
cannot be accessed by any of your other pro- 
grams. They can, however, be accessed by other 
Muse programs, including Form Letter Mod- 
ule, Address Module, Address Book, and the 
Sensible Speller. 

All in all, this is a fine package that merits 
the serious consideration of users who want to 
get serious about word processing. It has excel- 
lent documentation, readable manuals, a good 
tutorial, and many of the features that we've 
come to associate with a standalone word proc- 
essor. And the forty-column /eighty-column op- 
tion can be the best of both worlds. The forty- 
column gives clearer letters and is easier on your 
eyes, while the eighty-column lets you see just 
what a page will look like. 
Letter Perfect (Version 5), LJK Enterprises, 
Box 10827, Saint Louis, MO 63129; (314) 846- 
6124. $149.95. 



Equipment required 32K minimum, one or 
two disk drives, monitor, printer. 

When you start up Letter Perfect for the 
first time, you're asked to describe the charac- 
teristics of your systan. How will video display 
be handled? Your choices are Apple forty-col- 
umn format, the ASL Smarterm, the Bit 3 Full 
View 80, the Videx Videoterm, the M & R 
Sup'R Term, and the Vista Vision 80. Next you 
must select the printer interface, choosing from 
serial, parallel, micromodem, and even the old Ap- 
ple serial interface. 

Now you're asked a series of questions 
about the kind of printer you have. The op- 
tions on the program menu are NEC, 
Qume/Diablo, Epson, Centronics 737/739, 
Paper Tiger, and others. The system also asks 
for information about how you intend to inter- 
face with the package. 

The next series of questions concerns the 
formatting of your pages of output. You can se- 
lect the sizes of the top and bottom margins, the 
width of the page, whether text is right justified 
or not, the number of spaces between lines, the 
size of the left-hand margin, and how footers 
and headers will be spaced. It's nice to be able 
to choose these options from a menu rather 
than having to place printer control characters 
in the document itself 

Certain choices of printer provide you with 
an additional menu that allows you to take ad- 
vantage of your printer's special features, such 
as underlining, boldface type, or enlarged print. 
With the Epson printer, for example, you can 



select different fonts, choosing from among four 
options: ten characters per inch (standard), a 
condensed font, a double-strike font, or an en- 
hanced font. 

Cursor movement around and through a 
Letter Perfect document is unusually flexible. 
You can move to the beginning of a document, 
the end of a document, to the beginning of the 
line, to the next page, or even back a page. In 
fact, you can scroll continuously through a 
document at a speed you select. 

Cursor movement is achieved by using vari- 
ous combinations of keys. For example, con- 
trol-Y moves the cursor up one line and con- 
trol-Z moves the cursor to the end of a line. It 
would have been nice if control keys hinted by 
letter at the operation they performed, but 
it's understandable that this would be very dif- 
ficult to do when there are a large number of 
commands to be considered. In any event, once 
you get accustomed to using a particular word 
processor, its keying sequence soon becomes 
second nature to you. 

The escape key is used in two different ways 
in Letter Perfect. It's used in place of the shift 
key to indicate a capital letter (keyboard modi- 
fication instructions to use the shift key for capi- 
talization are provided). The escape key is also 
used to get some special print characters. Press- 
ing escape and a particular number key allows 
you to print such things as a left or right brack- 
et, a power symbol, a back slash, open and 
closed braces, the at sign, and an underline. 
Subscripts and superscripts are also available. 

A merge option from the main menu al- 
lows you to add a file you already have on disk 
to the end of the file that's currently in memo- 
ry. In addition, you can use Letter Perfect in 
creating a database. This makes it possible to 
produce a form letter and to merge a list of 
names and addresses into that letter. 

One of Letter Perfect's attractive features is 
the fact that it has a companion product. Data 
Perfect is LJK's database management pack- 
age. As you would hope, the packages "talk to 
one another," which can be particularly useful 
when you wish to include data in a report. This 
is an advantage that should not be overlooked 
when you're considering a word processor. 

For the most part, the Letter Perfect user 
guide is well written. The progression of topics 
is logical and the manual is thorough, provid- 
ing you with all the documentation you need to 
use the system successfully. The package also in- 
cludes a helpful and attractive reference card. 

Some disadvantages to the manual are the 
fact that the explanations it contains, while 
clear, are often too long. No screen images are 
included to clarify the material being discussed, 
which means that it's sometimes hard to follow 
everything that's being said. 

In sum, the Letter Perfect word processing 
system is a well designed package that's easy to 
learn to use and well documented. It has all the 
features most people would expect of a profes- 
sional word processing package. Once you've 
defined your word processing needs, you're en- 
couraged to look at Letter Perfect and its com- 
panion, Data Perfect.

MICROBE: 

The Anatomical Adventure 

By Robert Clardy 

Your Prague Submarine, Lost 
in an Awesomely Beautiful, 
Yet Terrifying World. 

THE HUMAN BODY! 




Disguised as a challenging and exciting adventure/ 
arcade game, Microbe is, in reality, a gold mine of 
instructional material covering: 

• HEALTH AND SAFETY TOPICS 

• HUMAN ANATOMY AND IMMUNOLOGY 

• DISEASE AND DL^GNOSTICS 

• DRUG AND MEDICAL PROCEDURES 

• AND MUCH MORE 

Microbe is the first of a new breed of games, 
designed and produced by a team of professional 
designers, physicians, educators and programmers. 
This diverse group has produced a unique product 
that presents an immense amount of information in 
a thoroughly entertaining format suitable for 
individual or group use, for children, pre-meds or 
physicians. 

Your challenge begins with you in command of 
the crew of the submarine, Microbe, which has 
been shrunk to microscopic size and injected into 
the human patient. You must use your cunning, 
knowledge and dexterity to save your patient. 



Perhaps a blood clot in the brain needs to be 
removed. You navigate quickly but cautiously 
toward the brain as you fend off attacking viruses, 
white blood cells and other body defenses. Escape 
the labyrinth of passages that make up the lung or 
use your medical knowledge to tame the powerful 
human heart. 

Always different, always a challenge! Microbe 
uses the full capabilities of the Apple to provide the 
best adventure, arcade, strategic, and simulation 
game on the market. Game variation options 
change the skill level (speed of play, number and 
severity of attacks, etc.). The background (game 
players through physicians), the number of players 
(1, 2 or group play), and the emphasis (health/ 
safety vs. medicine). Microbe even talks with 
VOTRAX™ and ECHO™ speech boards. 

Enjoy your next viral infection, with Microbe: The 
Anatomical Adventure!

3-D Animation on your Apple!! 

Well, probably not your Apple. And not the kind of animation you 
think. Comp/animationis the term used by Creative Presentations of 
Schaumburg, Illinois, to describe their rather esoteric line of work. 

The Americans, They Are a Funny Race. The first and most fasci- 
nating aspect of existence that tends to come to human beings' atten- 
tion is the phenomenon of movement. Later on, we derive a subtle de- 
light and sense of satisfaction from seeing this most immediate evidence of 
life imparted to things that our reason tells us could not possibly be 
alive — wind-up toys, Betty Boop, a Ferrari, department store windows at 
this time of year, or Abraham Lincoln 120 years after his death. 

The ultimate, or at least current, manifestation of this phenomenon 
was developed in the laboratories of WED, the engineering arm of Walt 
Disney Productions, in 1963. A plexiglass mold filled with wires, brass 
tubes, bushings, bearings, valves, and ball and socket joints, covered with 
a latex skin molded over the body, resulted in the first "audio-animatron- 
ic figure" — a singing robin that serenaded Mary Poppins outside a win- 
dow, joined later by an entire flock as a permanent Disneyland at- 
traction. 

The computer programming requirements necessary to choreograph 
the voices and movements of these characters (in 1963!) can be imagined. 




AHD AriDI^EW (URISTIE 

The little songbirds, however, were only the first step on the evolu- 
tionary scale of computer figure animation. The following year, Disney 
turned up at the New York World's Fair with a historic creation, and a 
few prehistoric ones as well. Disney's dinosaur exhibit was life-sized, and 
had special transportation requirements. Few New Yoriters who saw it 
have forgotten the sight of a tyrannosaur and stegosaur being floated 
down the East River on barges. 

Robotic Rage. While the dinosaurs were impressive as an example of 
heavy figure animation, they were not technically far removed from the 
singing birds. Far more advanced, and one of the most popular attrac- 
tions at the Fair, was the audio-animatronic figure of Abraham Lin- 
coln, which rose from a chair and dehvered a speech, complete with ges- 
tures and shifting expressions. Lincoln had some bugs in him, and threw 
several mechanical fits in rehearsal, once smashing his chair. He calmed 
down for his debut, however, and is now a seasoned performer at both 
the Disney parks. 

The success of Disney's computer character animation did not es- 
cape the notice of technologically savvy businesses and entrepreneurs. 

Former Disney "imagineer" Alvaro Villa founded AVG Produc- 
tions in 1978, designing the "Battlestar Galactica" attraction for the Uni- 
versal Studios tour and the Monster Plantation at Six Flags Over Geor-

Bob Wire and Dusty Destry harmonize in the Country Critter Review. 



gia. His crowning achievement is reputed to be a robot duplicate of Andy 
Warhol that will be part of a national touring attraction in late 1983. It is 
said to have "the most sophisticated head ever built," capturing certain 
characteristic facial tics of the impassive pop artist. 

Behind Every Great Man, There's a Little Computer. Creative Pres- 
entations was involved in industrial theater and corporate communica- 
tions before creating a robot Mark Twain for a trade show in 1976. Since 
then, they have gone full time into the design, manufacture, and staging 
of animated productions. 

Frank Gaughan, creative director of Creative Presentations, is the 
mastermind behind the robotic attractions at Marriott's Great America, 
Hershey Park, and the Six Flags amusement parks. 

Before Creative enlisted the aid of an Apple, the usual eighteen-min- 
ute production required the assistance of a lighting coordinator to run 
the lighting and actually turn on the equipment and begin the show. The 
initial equipment configuration was a reel-to-reel tape deck, a pneumatic 
controller, and the lighting control panel. 

A typical show required a lighting coordinator, one live performer, 
and one usher for operation. The lighting coordinator had to pay close 
attention to the show and make discreet lighting changes on cue. The 
synchronization of character movement and sound were also critical. 

Now, an Apple usually hovers attentively stage-left, overseeing the 
show via control lines connecting it to the pneumatic solenoids in the ani- 
mated characters on stage, and running about sixty lighting cues, music, 
and character dialog. It also functions as house manager, keeping track 
of show times, controlling the house lights, and rewinding and cuing the 
reel-to-reel tape deck containing all the show routines and music. 

Before they got the Apple, Creative used their own system. "It 
worked okay," recalls Gaughan, "it just seemed to have a lot of trouble 
picking up the data. The Apple is very reliable." 

Teamwork. Slot 0 of the basic Creative Presentations Apple con- 
tains a ROM card programmed to fire the valves inside the pneumatic 
solenoids, releasing the compressed air that causes the character onstage 
to execute a programmed movement. When the computer signal ceases, 
the air flows back through another valve.

Mark Twain under construction; Creative Presentations's first entry 
into the world of computer-animated figures. 

Slot 2 contains a data decoder card that takes input from the reel-to- 
reel deck — two to four channels, music on the right track and data-on- 
tape on the left — translating for the ROMs so they'll know which char- 
acter is to move and what the move will be. 

Slot 3 holds a clock for time keeping; and slot 4 contains a character 
interface card that communicates with the stage characters and the light- 
ing control panel. This card takes the instructions from the ROM card in 



slot 0 and relays the electrical impulse to a corresponding card inside the 
stage character, triggering the appropriate solenoid. Each character in- 
terface card can control up to eight characters and can be expanded to 
control up to sixteen stage characters with more than two hundred indi- 
vidual movements . . . with one Apple. 

Food for Fun. Gaughan estimates that "there are probably five or six 
computer animation companies out there that you could call solvent." It 
is a specialized profession with a limited clientele. The prevaihng winds of 
the current economic situation are not great help, either. Bob Wire, Lester 
the Mule, and Trail Dust, the gang from the Six Flags Over Texas 
"Country Critter Revue," all got pink-slipped in November. Yet now 
that they've trudged back to their home base at Creative, they may soon 
find work again as an attraction at Celebration Station in Rockford, Illi- 
nois ... or as restaurateurs. The pizza business is now heavy into com- 
puter animated revues, with Pizza Time carving out their Chuck E. 
Cheese empire on the West Coast, and Show Biz Pizza taking over the 
Southwest. Some restaurants do their programming in-house; others go 
to such computer animation houses as Creative Engineering of Orlando, 
Florida, the giant of the field, or to Creative Presentations. 

It all started, of course, with Disney. The parks in Anaheim and Or- 
lando use what is called (sorry, Walt) a "dirty syston," with hydraulic 
lines pumping oil rather than air through the characters' synthetic ar- 
teries, causing greater pressure and allowing for the slight lift of an eye- 
brow, the curling of a lip, and the movement of large, heavy dinosaur 
limbs — feats that could not be duplicated by the pneumatic solenoids 
that can raise a felt-covered hoof or airy feathered wing. Nor can they 
duplicate the faint, strangely exciting aroma of hot machine oil that lends 
extra power to Mr. Lincoln's words and giddiness to pirates' plundering. 

Air, however, is cheaper than oil. Thus, a hungry America must 
sacrifice a little realism while chowing down to the musical accompani- 
ment of electronic vermin, quadripeds, and various reptile and avian 
species. 

Besides, if a line ruptures, you won't get oil all over your pepperoni.

The Loneliest Time 




This couldn't be happening. Not to Gil Bonds. No sir. Not now. 

Yellow light bulbs shone through grimy glass holders shaped 
like giant sunflowers in the long, dim hallway. Thrusting thin fin- 
gers into the pocket of his sweat-stained dress shirt, Gil located a 
cigarette and transferred it to his bare, slightly trembling lips. In 
the inside pocket of his black coat, Gil grasped a butane lighter. 
Eyes fixed on the closed door across the hall, he automatically lit 
the cigarette. 

Where is that lousy crook? She said ten minutes and it's been 
thirty. Three cigarettes. This stinking marble seat is getting colder 
by the minute. 

Gil nervously brushed back his short, curly mop of charcoal 
black hair. He was one of those people who hate to wait for any- 
thing. At age thirty-seven, he shouldn't be expected ever to wait for 
anything, least of all to see his lawyer. 

Without a sound the door marked "private" opened in front 
of him. A pa-son carrying a briefcase, dresed in a long yellow rain- 
coat and wearing a motorcycle helmet, stepped out., Gil looked 
dovm and crushed his half-finished cigarette on the tiled floor as 
the silent person in the raincoat walked off down the hall. In the 
open doorway stood Rhonda Realty. 

"Hello, Gil. Sorry for the delay. For God's sake, come on in." 
Rhonda smiled and held the door for him. 

The conference room was small and plain. There were no win- 
dows and only the barest necessities, one small table and two 
chairs. Gil and Rhonda sat facing each other. 

"How do you feel?" Rhonda asked as she lit a cigarette. "Only 
a fool wouldn't be nervous. Don't let it get the better of you." 



"I feel like I'm walking the plank and the sword sticking in my 
back is very sharp," Gil said, staring intently at Rhonda and her 
salmon-red locks. He looked away embarrassed. 

"Now just calm down, Gil. If you tell the judge and that 
moron-filled jury the truth, like you told me, nothing will happen. 
They only throw the guilty in prison." 

"Am I guilty?" Gil asked, staring intently again. He swal- 
lowed and licked his lips. 

"The only thing you're guilty of, Gil, is being a drunkard." 

Thin fingers grasped another cigarette. Last one before the 
frying pan. 

Lost in thought, ignoring Rhonda, Gil took a bigger than 
usual puff on his cigarette and started hacking violently, dropping 
the cigarette on the floor. 

"Honestly Gil. You're so smashed all the time. If you hadn't 
been imperiafly bombed that night, this whole thing would be fic- 
tion." 

Gil closed his eyes and let out a smoky whimper. 

"Which reminds me. They may try to get you with some other 
charge. You won't get away easily. Be careful what you say." 
Rhonda put her hand on Gil's arm. "I think you don't have a 
thing to worry about." 

Gil wanted to believe this beautiful lawyer, but his sad face be- 
trayed his real emotions. 

"Look," she took his arm again and kept it this time, her face 
glowing with a detCTmination that was very becoming. "We both 
know that you're not a technological spy. You're not involved 
with industrial espionage. Right?"

"No way," Gil said grimly. 

"Okay then. You've got nothing to worry about. Tell the truth." 



Gil entered the courtroom and sat in the seat designated for the de- 
fendant. Except for Rhonda, he knew no one else in the large, well-lit, 
chilly room. 

This can't be happening. It's just impossible. It was an accident. Hon- 
estly. I didn't mean to do it. 

Gil fought to keep his thoughts from overflowing and ruining his 
shaky composure. Concentrate. Stay alert. Listen to every word. Watch 
the judge. Ignore the jury. 

He tried to remain calm on the outside while the TVM camera crews 
set up. Two hulky cameramen and two wispy newsgirls represented the 
two most popular and raunchy networks. Gil shivered at the sight of 
them. 

It's not the 150 million watching around the world that bother me. It's 
the twelve in this godforsaken state. Those closeups can kill. God, I hope the 
bloated wineskins under my eyes aren't too bad. 

Knees shaking, Gil stood with head bowed as the robot clerk an- 
nounced the judge: "All rise. The court of greater Guthrie, Oklahoma, is 
now in session. Honorable Judge Phyllis Birch presiding." There was si- 
lence in the courtroom. Even the high-speed video cameras were noiseless. 

White, shoulder-length hair fell haphazardly on the judge's black 
robe. Gil judged her age at close to sixty. The Honorable Phyllis Birch 
settled majestically on her seat like a Boeing 784 touching down at the Ok- 
lahoma City airport. Straightening her small, round-rimmed glasses, she 
spoke a few words Gil couldn't make out to the robot clerk, who then 
disappeared behind a door. 

The cameras rolled on and the day in court began. Gil's was the only 
case. His heart jumped every time he heard his name mentioned. There 
was little else amidst the legal mumbo jumbo passing between the judge 
and the attorneys that Gil could understand. He motioned to the robot 
coffee vendor moving down the aisle. Gil awaited his fate calmly, with a 
steaming cup of Brazilian black. 

Just try and screw me. I dare you. Til sue. Try and defame me on 
TVM. 

The prosecuting attorney made his opening statement, addressing the 
court from next to his desk. He made it out to be an open-and-shut case. 
Rhonda listened attentively. Gil began to feel like his was a lost cause. 

The newsgiris wrote frantically on tiny handywriters. 

At least they have TVM up the river at State Pen. 

I must be going mad. That can't happen. 

Gil looked apprehensively at the wall of jurors. The faces and upper 
bodies of twelve honest, working, voting folks, beamed from outlying 
towns, showed impassively. 

You really can't tell which way their eyes are looking. 

The twenty-inch monitors were in two rows of six. A black man with 
very long hair sat smoking a fat cigar on the screen in the lower, far-right 
corner. Suddenly it seemed like he was staring straight at Gil, who al- 
most spilled his coffee. Gil looked away and then back quickly. The man 
with cigar was watching the DA again. 

Listen to every word. Watch the judge. Ignore the jury. 

Gil snapped out of his blue funk in time to see Rhonda trying to 
catch his attention. 

What does she want? Move over there? You're joking. You're not — 
dammit. Gil looked frantically at the judge and blinked twice. She's gone. 
Must be a recess. 

Gil walked over to an ancient-looking wood rail and leaned over to 
hear Rhonda. 

"I'm making my opening statement in five minutes, so sit tight. You 
won't be called on the stand until tomorrow. Gives you a chance to come 
in all fresh and bright tomorrow morning." 

Gil coughed and grabbed Rhonda's arm. 

"Jesus, Gil. Go have a cigarette in the lobby. Be back in five min- 
utes. We're not through this day yet." Rhonda returned to her seat. 

Gil puffed hungrily and looked at the bleak, wintry outdoors. The 
forty-story Mid-American CompBank building glistened a quarter-mile 
straight ahead. Gil had been in that building only once, ten years ago. 
That was for a successful job interview. Long before and ever since, Gil 
had wanted to work in that gorgeous, metallic building. 



T A L 1^ DECEMBER 1982 

But no. Make me live somewhere between Hennessey and Lovell and 
work at that damn telecommuting center. 

Gil returned to the courtroom. Almost immediately the judge en- 
tered and Rhonda b^an her opening statement. 

And does the company take care of its own kind? I have to unload 
mucho dollars for this hotshot lawyer, my whole Christmas bonus. They'll 
probably fire me no matter what happens. 

Back to TVM in the stripy hole. 

"I repeat, members of the jury, we will prove that this sad man is the 
victim of a strange coincidence. Does he look like the kind of man who 
would consciously vandalize the peaceful and well-respected Rodan Cor- 
poration of Oklahoma? No one says computers aren't foolproof. Mis- 
takes can still be made." 

On that note, Rhonda sat down and Judge Birch sat up high in her 
chair. Gil felt sick. The coffee can't be that awjul. 

After another short recess the prosecution presented its case. 

There was only one witness, the computer. Gil's crime was there in 
black and white, from the instant the computer nabbed him in the act. 
The computer's record of the event was the single most damaging piece 
of evidence against him. It showed that a break-in had occurred and that 
the signal originated from Gil's home. Written statements from the ar- 
resting officers and incriminating fingerprints from Gil's keyboard were 
handed over to the judge. 

The prosecution made some curious points, inconsistencies found in 
Gil's behavior and actions. In the end, said the prosecudon, Gil was an 
inexperienced criminal, but a criminal nonetheless. Maximum penalty 
was demanded, for breaking and entering a closed corporate computer 
system: ten years in the state penitentiary. 

"A very interesting case, which will resume tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. 
sharp," said Birch. The robot clerk appeared again. The judge exited and 
the court broke up. 

Rhonda found Gil. 

"You look terrible. Get some sleep. Come on." 

He got up slowly and headed for the exit behind her. 

"It wasn't so bad now, was it? Gil, you honestly are something. Get 
you in the sun and you almost look human." 

Want to go out for a drink baby? No, forget it. Not a good idea. 

"Can you drop me by the rails, Ms. Realty?" 

"Rhonda, you dope! Rhonda. You're paying me enough to call me 
Rhonda. None of this Ms. Realty crap. I hate that name. Somebody's 
idea of a joke." Her face was as red as her hair. 

"Did you say you need a ride? No trouble. Hop in." 

Gil enjoyed sitting in the big back seat with Rhonda while a chauf- 
feur drove the battery-run Behemoth 310 to the commuter station. Not 
bad. Let someone else do the driving. Sit here in privacy and enjoy the 
scenery. Rhonda drives around like this all the time. Wish it were mine. 

"Get lots of sleep. Don't stay up late," Rhonda said at the station. 

"See you tomorrow," Gil said meekly. Rhonda drove off. 

Gonna ride that rail. All the way home. Thirty miles to my darling. All 
the way home. 

"Seven rooms is all it is. Seven rooms of gloom." 

Thirty minutes later, Gil sat alone in his hving room listening to a 
GM oldies station, eating a leftover broccoli spear. 

This house's so alone. Since you went away. Miss your sweet smile oh 
darling. Since you went away. 

Gil took a glass down from the cupboard and made himself a drink. 
The only way Til go to sleep early enough to wake up tomorrow is start 
drinking now. Gil forgot to eat dinner and got to sleep very early. 



/ rode that rail. Thirty miles to my doom. Hurry save me oh my dar- 
ling. Thirty miles to my doom. 

The next morning, before the trial, Gil and Rhonda met by accident 
in a coffee shop. 

"I'm glad I found you. I feel a lot better," Gil said as he sipped 
steaming java. 

"You look better." 

"I got plenty of sleep." Gil put down his cup. "What's wrong? Now 
you look down in the mouth." 

"Gil, I'm worried. They're really after your head. They may try 
something . . . something degrading." 



DECEMBER 1982

"To me or them?" He lit a cigarette. 
"Both." 

"I don't understand." 

Rhonda stared into her coffee cup like she was peering into the cen- 
ter of the world. Deep furrows on her brow, like rivers on a road map, 
appeared and then vanished. Her right forefinger traced a small portion 
of the white cup's rim. 

"What's there to explain, Gil? Things haven't been good for the 
World of Commerce the last two years. Money's in short supply. Sys- 
tems are failing. There must be someone to blame. You're it. You're 
being blamed for all the ills of the world." 

"Don't say that. You're supposed to encourage me, not make me 
more paranoid." Gil puffed madly on his cigarette. 

"I know that, Gil. You're such an innocent child. A child in a big 
world." 

/ deserve that. A child facing imprisonment for a crime I didn't mean to 
commit. I wasn't trying to bust into that compwork. I didn't know what I 
was doing. I was drunk. 

"Come on, Gil. You'll do all right. We'll keep you out of State Pen 
and settle this matter today. I promise. Just watch out for the prosecu- 
tion; they'll ask some loaded questions." Rhonda smiled prettily. Gil had 
the feeling she had just resolved some nagging problem and was now 
freer. "Cheer up. I think the judge is looking out for you," she said. 

Gil chewed on that last morsel of information as he walked in and sat 
down in the courtroom. 

They're here again. I can remember when TVM newsers weren't al- 
lowed in courtrooms. How interesting can this case be? I guess when you 
don't have anything else to do. ... And the jury fades in. They all look like 
schoolteachers. I did my bit of duty. What a bore. You have to sit in this 
stupid room looking at TV monitors, while a dumb robot lets you in and 
out, lights your cigarettes, operates the video camera, and serves coffee and 
doughnuts. It's like going to the autodentist. Judgment is extracted. And 
one is alone with one's numbness. 

Rhonda called Gil to the witness stand. Once he was settled she 
smiled and gently asked him the big question. 

"Mr. Bonds, please tell us exactly what happened the night of De- 
cember 19, 1997. You may go back as far in time as you wish in order to 
tell all the facts and factors leading up to the events of that night. Be thor- 
ough and keep nothing from this court." 

Gil fidgeted in the hard wooden seat and looked at Rhonda. Getting 
up here was easy. Now he had to talk coherently. Rhonda's face 
showed no emotion, but Gil thought he detected a slight jerk of her head 
for encouragement. 

"There's not much to tell. Most of it's pretty personal, what led up to 
that night. But I'm not ashamed to talk about it." 

/ am. She was too good to lose. I drove her away. 

The cameras whirred silently and everyone looked at Gil. 

"That afternoon, we had the traditional Christmas party at work. 
My only real friends are the people I work with. We drank a lot and 
danced a lot. Everybody had a good time. The company, Mid-Ameri- 
can CompBank, was paying for it, so everybody felt good. There hadn't 
been a party like it since last Christmas. 

"I danced with five or six of the girls in the office, including my boss. I 
was having a great time until I started thinking about my wife. You see, 
she left me three months ago and I'm still in love with her. Suddenly the 
party was empty and lifeless for me. I had drunk quite a bit and began 
to feel uncomfortable. And I couldn't stop thinking about Nellie, 
my wife." 

The prosecuting attorney coughed loudly and Judge Birch noisily 
shifted positions in her chair. 

"I took the rails home late that afternoon. B Red line to West Lovell, 
Stop O. I felt down and lonely. I arrived home around 6:45 p.m. At 7:30 
p.m. I decided to contact Nellie through the CPWN." 

Gil swallowed and paused. He looked at the jury, and they seemed to 
be falling asleep. A spectator in the back of the room stifled a loud yawn. 
Judge Birch smiled slightly and looked at Gil. He could have sworn it 
was a look of encouragement. 

"You see, I was desperate. I felt like Janes Stewart in an old movie I 
saw years ago on TVM. What if I had never existed? Would the world 
even notice? Would the people I've known be better off? The only good 



thing I've done in my life is marry Nellie, and then I ruined that. I want- 
ed to patch things up. I really wanted her back. My life was falling apart. 

"So I tried calling her on my terminal. I figured I'd find her some- 
how, even though I had no idea where she was." Gil paused and cleared 
his throat. 

"I'm not even a preprogrammer, but I have a professional 899 A 
supermicrocomputer, the model many engineers use, I'm told. The ma- 
chine was given to me by my boss after a particularly good year. Half the 
keys are foreign to me. I've only used it for sending and receiving cwiks 
and reading the news services." 

With drink in hand, I sat at the monitor. The room was starting to swirl 
around and the radio blasted country-reggae. Where are you? Hit those 
keys. Smash 'em. Fll find you. 

"I must have hit a wrong sequence of characters early on, because 
nothing went the way it was supposed to. I tried linkage with the county 
files and accessed my next-door neighbor's mailbox instead." 

Ha ha, up yours, Ben and Barbara. No messages today. Hope that tree 
falls on your house. 

"Apparently I erased half the programs in my neighbor's databank, 
but I didn't know it at the time. I must have somehow switched the key- 
board into a different mode. I thought I was typing words. Anyway, the 
computer seemed to be sending something else altogether. 

"I tried again to link with county and found myself disrupting the 
Guthrie Municipal Hospital." Gil stopped guiltily and scratched his 
nose. "I didn't mean to do any of it. But once I started there was no way 
to stop. I had to find her." 

That was the scariest part. Somehow I blocked all incoming and out- 
going data from the hospital's emergency communications compwork for 
thirty seconds. Any longer and I might have caused real trouble. It was the 
middle of the evening, the busiest time for the hospital. God, the tragedy I 
might have caused. 

"I tried one more time to find Nellie. I keyed her folks' number in 
Meridian. Suddenly, I was staring at a bright red screen with a cryptic 
symbol on it. I tried typing something, but nothing happened. I typed 
some more out of frustration. Nonsense it was. I tried to say 'NeUie come 
back.' " 

Nelhi,, com bacck. Doon't go nnow. Damn lights, can't see a thing. 
Why's it all red? What the hell is going on here? Now it wants prompting. 
Okay, sucker. Here you go. 

"That didn't work. The screen just got redder and displayed a blank 
line, as if it wanted me to sign my name. So I typed, 'Go to hell.' Well, 
that's just what happened. My screen wait black, except for a line of blaz- 
ing white characters. It said 'Intruder, Break One, Area 23.' " 

Oh man. What did I do? Damn drink, where' d it go. Hell, where's the 
bottle. Now the screen's flashing. And that noise, like a chimpanzee play- 
ing a synthesizer. What have I done? Dammit, now the computer's shut it- 
self off. What's going on? 

"Before I could tell what happened I fainted. When I awoke, the po- 
lice were standing over me. They had entered the house and were prepar- 
ing to arrest me. They said I had broken into the compwork of the Ro- 
dan Corporation of Oklahoma. I didn't know what they were talking 
about." 

Rhonda looked at Gil. Her strong, Irish face was rigid. Her stance 
forward, like an athlete. She stared at Gil with her big brown eyes for 
perhaps fifteen seconds. 

"A few more questions, Mr. Bonds," she said quietly. 

"Is it a fact that you don't know anyone who is currently working at 
the Rodan Corporation?" 

"Yes. It's on the other side of the county. I've never been there." 

Rhonda looked at a small piece of paper. 

"Is it true that before December 19, you had never heard of Van- 
teric coding?" 

"Yes." She's good. She's great. 

"But you had heard of SpectreNet, which you can access on your 
899 A supermicrocomputer?" 

"Yes. I never used that feature. To tell the truth, I don't care much 
for computers and all that. I work with them, doing the same thing year 
after year. So when I get home, I ignore my smc most of the time." 

Rhonda looked down at her piece of paper again. 

"Have you tried many times to contact your wife since she left you?" 



326 



S O F T A I 1^ 



DECEMBER 1982 



Gil gulped, looked at the video cameras and then at the jurors. 

"Yes. I've tried a dozen times to find her, but I haven't reached her 
once." / call her friends but they never seem to pass on the messages. May- 
be she doesn't want to see me. 

How the truth can sting. She probably never really loved me. Loved my 
salary is more like it. She's gone for good. 

Gil's face reflected the stone-cold facts running through his mind. 

"That will be all, Mr. Bonds. Thank you. No more questions, Your 
Honor." As Rhonda turned to go to her seat, Gil thought he caught a 
fleeting smile of encouragement. He tried to feel optimistic. It wasn't 
easy. 

Here we go. The big moment has arrived. Man turns to jello on TVM. 

The prosecution had plenty of questions it wanted to ask Gil. A deli- 
cate, educated-looking man of about forty stood up. Hands clutching 
several sheets of paper, the prosecuting attorney stood by his desk and 
addressed Gil on the witness stand. 

"Mr. Bonds, you say that you arrived at home on December 19 at 
6:45 p.m. and then tried to contact you wife at 7:30 p.m. What were you 
doing during the forty-five minutes between these two events?" 

Gil rubbed his hands together and coughed a smoker's cough. 

"Mister, I drank a couple of drinks, smoked two cigarettes, and spent 
about fifteen minutes looking for an old numberbook." 

The prosecuting attorney got steely-eyed. 

"Mr. Bonds, do you know a Mr. Shaver Sullivan?" 

"I've never heard the name before." Is this a trick? 

"He's a well-known smasher of spy rings. Did you know that Mr. 
Sullivan visited your office only two months ago?" 

"A lot of people visit our office. No." Who is this Sullivan? 

"Did you know that your wife has been seen with Sullivan several 
times?" 

"Objection!" Rhonda jumped to her feet. "Question does not tend to 
lead to relevant material." 

That was pretty lousy. Up yours, Mr. Prosecution. Of course she's see- 
ing someone. Who the hell cares? 

Rhonda sat down flustered but triumphant. 

"Did you know your wife is currently working for the Rodan Cor- 
poration, Mr. Bonds?" The crafty little man twisted off the last two 
words like they were disgusting, crawling insects. 

"No." / already said I haven't talked to her, schmuck. 

"She's a junior accountant there." 

Judge Birch displayed impatience. "The prosecution will please get to 
the point." Rhonda held her breath. 

"Mr. Bonds, do you hate the Rodan Corporation?" 
The judge frowned. 
"No, mister." 

"Is it true your wife called you the morning of December 19?" 

If she had called? If she had called. "No, sir." 

"No further questions." The sly little man sat down. 

Gil walked back to his seat. He swam through a liquid sensation of 
conflicting thought and impressions. Has he proven anything? What was 
all that leading up to? How come he stopped. They sure pulled one on me. 
Rhonda said "degrading." Do I really look like a spy? They've taken the 
computer's word for it that I am, but that isn't enough and they know it. So 
why drag Nellie into all this? 

Gil sat down. Rhonda called to the witness stand Filmore Stanton, 
code specialist with Starkweather Consultants. She questioned him 
about Gil's keying Vanteric Code on SpectreNet. Stanton showed that 
Gil keyed "Nelhie,, com bacck. Doon't go nnow," and SpectreNet trans- 
lated it into the precise Vanteric lock-breaker for Rodan's computer 
system. 

Stanton also showed that the phrase "go to hell" in Vanteric was the 
door-opener for Rodan's compwork. When Gil typed that line too fast it 
set off the alarm, which tracked the signal and froze his keyboard. Any- 
one who had knowledge of the codes would surely know about the se- 
quenced timing for entering them. 

Rhonda sat down. The prosecution did not cross-examine Stanton. 
The robot clerk glided in and announced a twenty-minute break. Rhon- 
da motioned Gil over to the rail. 

"Let's go outside. I've got something to tell you." 



Gil had been feeling good up to this point. He had sat on the hot seat 
and survived. He could have sworn it was all over. 

They stood near a large plexiglass window and smoked nervously. 
"Gil, get ready for a shock. The next witness is your wife." 

"What!" She's here. Witness? For whom? 

"Gil, she's a witness for the prosecution. She's going to testify against 
you. I'm still now sure about what. Chances are you've nothing to worry 
about." 

Gil suddenly felt cold. 

"It sounds like you've known for a while," he said. He felt betrayed. 
Since yesterday. Remember the person in my office when you 
came by." 

Of course. Couldn't tell whether it was a man or woman in that rain- 
coat and motorcycle helmet. 

"I was worried sick while I was talking to her. I knew you would be 
sitting on that bench," Rhonda said. "I convinced her to put on the hel- 
met so that other people wouldn't see her coming out of the conference 
room. It's just luck that she didn't see you. It would have been a horrible 
scene." 

"What did she say?" Gil dropped his cigarette into the airotray. 

Rhonda stared at the smoke swirling around their feet. Then she 
raised her head resolutely and looked directly at Gil. 

"She was looking for the best deal. She'd agree to keep certain infor- 
mation out of court, if we gave her money. A lot of money. I told her we 
wouldn't give her a nickel. Boy, did she take off in a hurry, straight to the 
prosecution." 

Gil was numb. Don't cry. Not now. Later. 

"I'm still not sure what she's going to say." Rhonda lit another ciga- 
rette. "Probably lies. A final attempt to win over the jury. They must 
have just closed the deal a few hours ago. Her idea of money is peanuts 
to these guys. But they're desperate now. They're not past trying some- 
thing this cheap." 

Gil looked down with a blank, miserable expression. 

"I think I'll have no problem. Their evidence is real lousy. They tried 
to crack you. That was their plan. Get you on the stand and nail you to 
the wall. Now it's my turn to grill their prize witness." 

Rhonda looked at Gil compassionately. 

"I know this is rough for you, Gil. She doesn't think much of you 
and will try to hurt you on the stand. Why they changed the laws I'll 
never know. It's bad enough letting the newsers in. Please don't let it get 
to you. She only wants money. I think that's all she ever wanted in life. 
Money and the spotlight." 



The prosecuting attorney looked like a proud father when he called 
Nellie Thomas Bonds to the stand. The tension in the courtroom was 
thick as the surprise witness came forward. The jurors all stared. 

Wearing some outfit I've never seen. Took off the wedding ring. Damn. 
At least she didn't change her hair. 

Nellie seemed calm and collected, though she looked anything but in- 
nocent. Long blonde hair, curled and bleached, made a striking contrast 
to her pitch-black, navylike outfit and bright red lipstick. She was young, 
pretty, and dangerous. 

"Ms. Bonds, you are aware of the charges being brought against 
your husband?" Once again the attorney brushed off the last two loathe- 
some words. 

"Yes." Long blonde synthetic lashes flickered. 

"You have observed behavior that would prove your husband is part 
of a spy ring?" 

"Yes." 

What is she thinking? Does she really hate me? She said she did, be- 
fore. I had a bottle in my hand and her stupid OuijaCalc in the other. Tm 
glad I broke it. 

"Did your husband ever say anything bad about the Rodan 
Corporation?" 

"Yes. He said he hated it." 

/ never .said that. All I said was there was a time when there weren't all 
these damn foreign companies in America. 

"Did your husband have any reason to hate the Rodan 
Corporation?"

WUTAI 1/ 



DECEMBER 1982 



"He said. They've ruined America. Someone should make them 
pay.' " 

IVhat is she talking about? Why are you doing this to me? It's over. Do 
I have to go to prison for it? 

"Ms. Bonds, tell us what happened four months ago on the night of 
October 1." 

"Objection. What bearing does this have on the case?" 
"I'm getting to that," said the prosecuting attorney acidly. 
"Overruled," said Judge Birch. 
"Go ahead, Ms. Bonds." 

Nellie looked down at her lap and then right at the jurors, slightly 
parting her lush red lips. 

"Gil came home smashed that night. I was distraught over his drink- 
ing. We got into an argument." 

Thanks for bringing that one back. A real bad one. The beginning of 
the end. God I hated you that night. 

"Something he said during the argument alerted me that maybe he 
was involved with a spy ring. I remember it clearly. 'We've got them 
now. Soon they will pay,' that's what he said. I asked him what he meant, 
but he refused to talk about it." 

Boy oh boy. That's slim. I was talking about collecting on last year's 
World Series bet with the Oklahoma City office. Everyone in our office was 
still due considerable bucks, but that's part of the game. You trick the los- 
ers into paying up. I didn't clarify because I was too angry. 

"Ms. Bonds, tell us what you found on September 12, 1982." 

"I found a piece of paper with computer code on it. It was crumpled 
up lying under a newspaper in Gil's study. I couldn't understand it, but it 
looked important. I kept it and showed it to a friend." 

"Who was this friend?" 

Mr. Sullivan no doubt. Probably been seeing him for years and never 
told me. Stab deeper, darling, it don't hurt no more. 

"Steven Anderson, a computer operator at the Rodan Corpora- 
tion's Hitchcock office." 

"Did your friend identify it as Vanteric code?" 

"Yes."

"Mr. Anderson is willing to testify. Your Honor, except he's on va- 
cation and can't be reached." The prosecuting attorney paused and then 
continued. 

"What happened to the piece of paper, Ms. Bonds?" 

"I threw out the piece of paper, wanting nothing to do with it. I 
didn't want to think my husband was a criminal." 

"That is all, Ms. Bonds." The prosecuting attorn^ sat down confi- 
dently. 

Rhonda stood up and looked at Nellie like she was about to breathe 
fire and burn up those tantalizing blonde curls. 

"Mrs. Bonds," Rhonda said, emphasizing the name like it was the 
bubonic plague, "you say the piece of paper may have had Vanteric 
code on it. Then you destroyed it. How come?" 

"Like I said, I didn't want any part of it." 

"Then why go to the trouble of taking it to your friend in the first 
place?" 

"I don't know." Nellie looked worried. Her thin, delicate face dark- 
ened with shadows of doubt. 

"Why did your curiosity stop when you still didn't know for sure 
what was on the paper?" 

"I was convinced it was Vanteric code because my friend Steven 
said so." 

Rhonda wound up. "Suppose the writing was of a harmless nature; 
did that ever occur to you?" 

"No, I suppose not." Nellie's golden lashes flickered nervously. 
"Is this scrap of paper a figment of your spiteful imagination?" 
"Objection!" 

Rhonda stared fiercely at the prosecuting attorney. 
"Sustained. You don't have to answer that question, Ms. Bonds." 
Judge Birch smiled wickedly. 
Nellie uncrossed her legs. 

I guess we have to take your word for it. And your friend's word that it 
was Vanteric code. And your word again that I hated the Rodan 
Corporation. 

"Was your husband ever involved with criminals before?" 
"Yes." 

"Can you remember these names?" 
Fictitious friends. Real crooks. Bingo. 

"We're waiting, Mrs. Bonds." Rhonda shifted on her feet impatiently. 
"I can't tell." 
"Why not?" 

Nellie's features suddenly wrinkled up into a mask of hate. Her 
blonde curls trembled. 

"Because that bastard will kill me if I tell. That's why I left him. He 
was desperate, and he knew I knew his plans. He told me one night. He 
said he'd beat me if I ever told anyone. I was scared." 

Rhonda closed her eyes and whispered, oh God, to herself. 

"How come you didn't go to the authorities immediately?" 

"I was scared of him and his friends. I knew they would find a way to 
get me." 

"What you're saying is contrary to all the facts known about Mr. 
Bonds up to this time. Why did you come forward so late in this trial?" 

"You may know more facts, but you don't know him. He's evil. He's 
a drunkard. He'd ruin any woman who marries him, like he ruined me. 
Luckily, I escaped. He's a loser. He'll never make it. He doesn't even 
have the guts to try a crime like this. It must have been one of his friends 
who started it. I hate them all as much as I hate him." 

/'// remember this day for a long time. Til try to forget, but it won't go 
away. Like the past three months. Til remember. She'll probably forget. 

"No further questions. Your Honor." Rhonda sat down and 
frowned. Nellie got up shakily and slowly took her seat in the court- 
room. 

Both attorneys made their closing statements. The prosecution stood 
by the computer's evidence, saying more conclusive evidence could be 
gotten, given time. Rhonda reiterated the points of the trial and pro- 
claimed Gil innocent of the charges. The jurors' monitors flickered out. 
They teleconferred in private to reach a verdict. 

Gil felt weak in the stomach and broke into a cold sweat. It comes 
down to this. Twelve strangers, miles away. What will they do? Gil mo- 
tioned to the robot coffee vendor and then changed his mind. He had a

hell of a time making it go away. 

The jurors returned and Gil stood up to receive his fate. The black 
man with long hair and a cigar spoke in a strong, educated voice. 

"We find the defendant not guilty of breaking and entering a closed 
corporate computer system." 

Tension lifted all around the courtroom and some talking broke out. 
Rhonda smiled and leaned back. The prosecuting attorney wrote 
frantically. 

Judge Birch pounded her gavel electronically. 

"I will hear any appeals tomorrow morning. For the moment you're 
a free man, Mr. Bonds. I have one piece of advice, should you ever deal 
with this court again. Stay away from the coffee, it's always awful." 

Gil laughed and gave the judge a high sign. The court broke up. 

Gil stood with drooping head, watching Nellie out of the corner of 
his eye. She took the arm of a tall, blond man in a long, gray coat. Gil 
fidgeted, as if he meant to go after her. 

"Forget her, she's no good." 

She was great the first two years of our marriage. Then something went 
wrong. She grew up in all the wrong ways. 

Rhonda took Gil's arm. He glanced at her; she looked ravishing. 

"I'm not sure why we won so easily. Some of the jurors must have 
been sympathetic. The jury as a whole discounted her testimony as being 
inconclusive. She helped you more than she hurt you." 

On the outside. Inside. . . . 

"Who cares? We won. Let's tear up the town. For starters, I'll buy 
you dinner at Monroe's," Rhonda said cheerfully. 

Gil exhaled. And then he laughed. It's good to win for a change. I beat 
them and her. I'm ready. Let's go baby. 

Two weeks later, Gil and Rhonda met in her office in downtown 
Guthrie. 

"Sorry to mess up your afternoon, but I said you wouldn't get away 
easy. They've brought further charges against you that you'll have to 
face." 

Gil puffed question marks with his cigarette smoke. 

"The new charge is drunk computing. I don't think you can get out 
of it either. The evidence is strong against you, mostly from what you 
said yourself during the trial." 

"Drunk computing? You're joking. I've never heard of such a thing." 

"Gil, it's been around for years, though not many people are ever 
convicted for it. It's only when you really foul things up, Like you almost 
did to the hospital; that kind of accident the authorities will notice." 

Well I'll be a skunk's uncle. 

"What are they going to do? Throw me in prison and take my li- 
cense away?" 

"Not for first-time offenders." She consulted an official-looking piece 
of paper. "They'll revoke your sending privileges. Your computer termi- 
nal will be capable of receiving information, but you'll have a fixed quota 
of cwiks." 

"Doesn't sound too bad. I don't call very many people anyways." 

"Maybe you can learn from it, Gil. Remember what happens when 
you lose control. You could have been tried for murder if you had seri- 
ously blocked communications at the hospital. And don't forget the trial 
we just went through. That was close. If the prosecution hadn't tried that 
cheap trick, we — it might have been even closer." 

When he didn't respond, she looked up. He was looking at her, his 
eyes steady. 

"I don't know how to thank you," he said after a moment. "Let's 
start with dinner tonight." 

"Sure, I'd love it." She began to gather her things, but Gil wasn't 
finished. 

"And tomorrow night." 

She stopped still. 

"And the next night. And the one after that." 

Rhonda's eyes searched Gil's. He imagined she was seeing the last 
few months in a moment. When she spoke, her voice was low but 
definite. 

"Yes." 

Gonna ride in a car. All the way home. Thirty miles with my darling. All 
the way home. 31

You haveni lived until youve died in space. 

And here's your chance. 
Software author Peter Folkos has created 
Alien Ambush, a space age nightmare. It's a hi-res, 
full-color arcade game, fiendishly written to give 
those nasty aliens every advantage. 

So if you have access to a 48K Apple* with 
DOS 3.3 or a 16K Atari 400/800** with a disk 
drive, and you're hot for some new thrills, Allen 
Ambush was written for you. But be warned: it just 
got a lot tougher to survive in space.

Softalk Presents The Bestsellers 



Where are all the smart guys now? 

There's never a surfeit of intelligence in any market, but there's clear- 
ly a shortage of it among pundits in the microcomputer industry. Even if 
there weren't, it might take more than the wisdom of Solomon to sort 
out the data accumulated by Softalk during the October poll. 

Consider that everybody except possibly Mike Markkula held last 
rites for the Apple II and the Apple III when the IBM Personal Com- 
puter hit the market about a year ago. Today, these two models are sell- 
ing like never before. 

Even those who hedged their bets said the Apple II would be forced 
to solicit the home user while IBM captured the desktop personal com- 
puter market as well as the small business market. Business software 
sales have never been better in the Apple market, while arcade games are 
wading in a morass of undifferentiated indifference. 

If arcade games, those perennial sales leaders, are dying, then the 
home-based game player must be buying Ataris, right? Then how did In- 
focom place four programs in the Top Thirty? 

Well, we can still all agree that all those folks who said they were buy- 
ing Apples for their children's education but walked out with Choplifter

course, VisiCalc leads the Apple II market in sales. But with Apple's 
grand giveaway in progress, it looked like a chance for somebody else to 
grab the gonfalon in the Apple III market. That somebody else turned 
out to be VisiCalc, with its advanced version. 

There are a lot of somebody elses out there though. October brought 
one other revelation. After a period of relative stagnancy in the number

it that both the Learning Company and Spinnaker could practically de- 
clare dividends off their October sales, with Spinnaker competing with 
the big guys for buyer attention?

get a hot product, you sell the hell out of it before the competition 
catches up, right? Not if you're Apple Computer. Then you give Apple 
Writer III and VisiCalc away with new Apple III sales, surely the best 
value in giveaways around. 

But won't those products stop selling in stores? Yeah, they'll drop 
from first and second to second and third.

Yes, dear hearts. The rest of the software industry should picket Visi-

How about a nice vacation on the 
beaches of France - for just $39.95? 



At SSI, we think that our latest software for the Atarif TRS-80® 
and Apple® — BATTLE FOR NORMANDY™ — is more than a 
great strategy game. We think of it as a great vacation package. 
After ait we are whisking you off to the northern coast of 
France for 25 days of fun and excitement (June 6 to 30, 1944) 
— all for just $39.95! 

Of course, we're not promising peace and quiet There is a 
war going on, you know....WorId War II! 

We'll be taking you to the beaches of Normandy in style. Not 
on a mere jumbo 747 or an ocean liner, but an LCI (that's 
Landing Craft Infantry). Let's see the Joneses top that!

And our service? Have we got good service — and plenty of 
it! Whole divisions and regiments of infantry, paratroopers, tank 
units, and commandoes are at your every beck and call. We do 
have to apologize for their different leadership and combat 
ratings. It's so hard to get good, consistent help these days. 

You want sightseeing? You've got sightseeing! Nice historical 
towns like St Lo, Cherbourg, and Caen — which you just have

of titles being carried in the marketplace, this month saw a full 25 per- 
cent jump. What was even more remarkable was that the increase was 
across the board. Significant jumps in available software in the past have 
usually centered on a currently popular genre. This month, software pub- 
lishers were zeroing in on all areas. 

For instance, the General Ledger horn State of the Art and QuickFile 
from Apple made the Apple III list for the first time. But threatening to 
overthrow the establishment is Micro Lab's Data Manager. And the ad- 
vent of the SoftCard III saw dBase II and WordStar sold for the Apple 
III for the first time. 

The number of new business packages for the Apple II defy listing in 
this short space. State of the Art was the only absolute newcomer to the 
Business 10 list, but publishers of accounting software are taking dead 
aim at the Apple market. BPI, Systems Plus, State of the Art, Goci, Con- 
tinental, Peachtree, and TCS are all active. Accountants can now fall 
asleep with the names of available modules dancing through their dreams. 

Screen Writer II regained the word processing lead from Apple Writ- 
er II, although the inclusion of the latter package in a special Apple pro- 
motion continued to make it the largest mover of any software package

We think our new 
mailing list program 
is the best in the world . 
And we're not alone . 



1st CLASS MAIL. By Bob Schoenburg and Steve Pollack. 
Here's a pair of authors who may be software's answer 
to Irving Wallace. Wallace is the bestselling author who 
hears the murmuring of general populace and caters to 
their desires. Bob Schoenburg and Steve Pollack seem 
to have the same trait. 
Consider. 

The pair brought out Home Money Minder, a 
perfectly respectable home finance package. Then they 
listened to the user feedback. The result was Home 
Accountant, one of the phenomenal success stories of the 
first half of 1982. 

Around the same time Home Money Minder hit, the 
team also tested the market with The Mailroom. 
Mailroom never was the success of HMM, but the authors 
used the same technique — listen to the users and in- 
corporate all the good ideas. The result is 1st CLASS 
MAIL - a program that, incredibly enough, manages to ' 
live up to its double-entendre name. 

All of the above is not to accuse Schoenburg and 
Pollack of putting out the programming equivalent of 
stalking-horses to do their market research for them. 
Their original efforts do stand on their own merit. They 
just pale next to the sequels. 

1st CLASS MAIL is so well thought out and so easy 
to use that other publishers who call their programs ' 'user 
friendly" should bow their heads in shame. 

SOFTALK got an early release of the program sans 
documentation. Yet a rank computer illiterate was able 
to apply the program to two separate uses with relatively 
little trouble. This is high praise indeed: that a novice 
operator could use a powerful program with no more 
than the screen menus. 

The program allows for twelve fields, clearly more 
than the traditional name and address of a mailing label. 
The implication is that the software can be put to other 
innovative uses as well. The built-in abOity to sort and 
filter on any field or combination thereof enhances the 
chances that users will find multiple applications for 
the program. 

Continental Software will actually be publishing 
four versions of the program.* The one already in release 
is for the Apple II using floppy disks. A hard-disk ver- 
sion will follow. Both versions are pending for Apple III 
as well, awaiting the development of a rapid binary sort 
subroutine. 

Ist CLASS MAIL is a first-rate program for special- 
ized data base applications.

The Home 10 saw some significant changes also. FaceMaker from 
Spinnaker and Type Attack from Sirius tied for eighth. FaceMaker ioins 
Apple Logo as the only educationally oriented software ever to score on 
the Home 10. Apple Logo, by the way, became the first of its kind ever to 
make the Top Thirty.

Improve your keyboard skills 

witn Masterlype. 

A typing program for the Apple II that 
dares to be fun. But it's not just child's play. 
No matter who you are, your computer will 
become a more efficient tool, as you become 
a more proficient typist. And MasterType 
can help. Dramatically 

But don't just take our word for It. 

Infoworld magazine had this to say 
about Lightning Software's Hi-Res MasterType: 
"MasterType is an excellent instructional 
typing game. We had fun reviewing it, and 
we highly recommend it to those who 
want to learn typing in an unconventional 
but motivating way" 

Infoworld also went on to rate Master- 
Type as Excellent in all categories. 

Bring your Apple hours of fun. 

Learning to type has never been so 
enjoyable. And since MasterType has 18 
different learning levels, you can play for 
hours while your typing gets increasingly 
better And all for only $59.95.

Type Attack ventured into the niche dominated by MasterType and, 
in its first full month of distribution, nearly unseated Microsoft's griz- 
zled Typing Tutor for second in the class. All the pundits who predicted 
hot sales of typing programs share a set with all living unicorns. 

Arcade games as a genre actually continue to sell well. It's just that 
there are now so many of them that few — six this month, to be exact — 
rise above mass. Frogger was the only truly successful new entry. New en- 
tries with promise were Canyon Climber, Crisis Mountain, Super Tax- 
man II, and Ming's Challenge. 

Infocom almost retired the trophy in the Adventure category. The top 
four programs are theirs, and a fifth, Zork III, missed the final place by 
only one sale. Ultrasoft's Mask of the Sun, bringing faster disk access to 
hi-res adventures, is a promising newcomer. 

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 7.9 percent of all sales of 
Apple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in November to ascertain their sales for the month 
of October. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold — such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and personal prefer- 
ence of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in November represented every geographical area of the continental 
United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index 
number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an 
arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correla- 
tive only for the month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index 
rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in an- 
other month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 3.77 percent, which translates roughly 
into the theoretical possibility of a change of 4.21 points, plus or minus, in any index 
number.

Two variations of an exciting new game with detailed 
graphics Challenge your friends or the computer to see 
who can win the pot or break the bank. 



The Fantasy 5 list saw an overhaul, with Snooper Troops I and Pris- 
oner II debuting. Snooper Troops I will probably get relegated to a new 
educational list soon, but its teaching is done within the framework of a 
children's fantasy role-playing game. 

Strategic Simulations, as befits its name, made an impact on the 
Strategy 5 list with Cosmic Balance and S.E. U.I.S. The latter program 
nearly unseated Castle Wolfenstein for first place. 

So all this should lead us to believe that Apple's still the promised 
land for software, right? Not if you're an arcade programmer.
