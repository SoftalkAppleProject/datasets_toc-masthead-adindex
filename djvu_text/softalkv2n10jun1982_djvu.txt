Picture this. Presentation-quality bar charts, line 
graphs, and pie charts. In black and white or color. On hard 
copy or a CRT. In seconds. 

That's PFS: GRAPH. The fastest, easiest, most econom- 
ical computer graphics software package you can buy. 

For the first time ever, computer graphics 
without computer programming. 

With GRAPH, all you do is enter your information and 
specify the kind of chart or graph you want. GRAPH does 
the rest. So instead of making a lot of complicated calcula- 
tions, you can make graphics. 

GRAPH is so straightforward, you can begin 
creating graphs and charts almost immediately. 
But it also has powerful capability you can stay 
with for years to come. 

For example, you can mix and match line and 
bar graphs, stack or compare up to four bar graphs 
simultaneously, even display as many as four 
graphs on the same set of axes. 

Software that pays for the system. 

Compared to hand-drawn graphics, GRAPi^ 
can save you enough money on your first set « 
overlays to pay for itself. And over the course of a 



few months, it could save you enough to pay for the 
Apple® computer system it works on. And that includes a 
Hewlett-Packard 7470A color plotter. 

It even works with VisiCalc® files. 

GRAPH is so flexible it allows you to work with raw 
data, other members of the PFS Series, or even VisiCalc files. 

No other computer graphics package gives you all this 
capability. Combine it with the beautiful simplicity of PFS 
for information management, and PFS: REPORT for infor- 
mation analysis, and you have a software family that works 
hard without being hard to work. 

So if you're thinking about making it in pic- 
tures, go see PFS: GRAPH. It's at your computer 
dealer now. And if they don't have it, ask them to 
contact Software Publishing Corporation, l90I 
Landings Drive, Mountain View, CA 94043.

Famous /^ples in History 



Luisa Puig, the computer operator who 
plays Queen Elizabeth I in the Renais- 
sance Pleasure Faire in California, sug- 
gested recently that if Queen Bess had 
been told about microcomputers, "The 
first thing she would have asked is how 
much does it cost and what does it do? She 
was a very executive woman. If some- 
one could prove that computers would be 
much more cost effective for the royal 
scribes and mathematicians, she would 
have wanted at least three — two for the 
palace and one for Lord Burley, the trea- 
surer. 

"Elizabeth would have done just fine in 
a corporate job in this century." 

Now, if Puig had quoted Liz instead of 
telling about her, and if she'd thrown in 
an Elizabethan dialect and maybe put it 
all in iambic pentameter, she'd have an 
ideal entry for this month's Softalk con- 
test. 

Famous Apples in History challenges 
you to imagine an encounter between 
some famous person in history and an 
Apple, where the Apple and its accouter- 
ments (software, for example) are the 
only anachronisms in the situation. Write 
down what the famous person would 
have said in your imaginary situation, 
and try to make the quotation appropri- 
ate to the era and circumstance ; finally, 
try to make it possible to g^ess from the 
quote who's speaking. 

Length is up to you, so long as it's no 
more than a page, double-spaced. One 
line is plenty, if it fills all the require- 
ments. 

Here are some examples; who they 
represent is printed upside down at the 
bottom of this page. 

1. "Contrary to what I have proclaimed, 
I see the Almighty has made a set of 
men that do all the eating and none of 
the work, and has made them with 
mouths only and no hands!" 

2. COMMAND? IGNITE ROMA 

YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MATCHES 
COMMAND? ACQUTrETE IGNTuM 
OK 

COMMAND? IGNITE ROMA 
OH WHY DON'T YOU GO PLAY 
YOUR VIOLIN? 

3. "Boot up my campaign again and see 
what happens if the second army 
takes the left flank, the third the rear, 
and . . ." 

4. Heard during a nineteenth-century 
ga.me of Computer Bismarck: "Damn 
the torpedos! F^ll speed ahead!" 



5. "So this is the Apple that fell on 
Isaac's head. No wonder he's been so 
down to earth lately." 

6. To boot or not to boot: that is the 

question: 

Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to 
suffer 

The slings and arrows of syntax error. 
Or to take reset against a break in 512 
And by opposing crash them. 

7. He lit a cigarette. 

The thing would not boot. Its time of 
booting was over. He remembered the 
times before. They were happy times. 
It had booted everything he had. It had 
been young and strong and its chips 
were clean and they worked quietly 
and well, with no smoke. It was old 
now. Those times were past. "I am 
sorry, machine," he said. "Tomorrow 
I must trade you. It is all that is left." 
The machine said nothing. A light rain 
was falling. It began to rust. 

Entries will be judged by historical 
ring of truth, probability, wit, and gener- 
al quality of method of meeting require- 
ments. 

Include the name of the famous person 
you're quoting on your entry in case 
we're dense. 

$100 worth of Softalk advertisers' prod- 
ucts is the first-place prize. Two runners- 
up will win $25 gift certificates at their 
local computer stores. 

Fill out the entry form or a facsimile 
and send it with your entry on a separate 
but-attached piece of paper to Softalk His- 
tory, 11021 Magnolia Boulevard, North Hol- 
lywood, CA 91601. Deadline is July 16, 1982. 
Every entry must have the entry form in- 
formation on it or with it and there may be 
no more than ten entries per envelope.

The High-Resolution Color Monitor 

for Apple H 




Amdek's new Color-ll monitor with DVM interface board 



No video monitor has ever combined Apple II compati- 
bility with exceptional performance like the new 13" 
Color-ll monitor from Amdek. 

Color-ll features our optional new DVM peripheral board 
for easy interfacing with your Apple II. And look at the 
other top-of-the-line features Color-ll offers: 

• RGB, TTL input for high resolution graphics. 

• 80 X 24 character display capability (with expansion 
card by Vydec). 

• 560 (H) X 260 (V) resolution. 

• Molded-in carrying handle for easier portability. 

• Front-mounted controls for faster fine-tuning. 

So if you want to get the most from your Apple II 
system, get the "most" monitor. Ask your dealer about 
Amdek's new Color-ll monitor with the optional DVM 
interface board. 



What is DVM? The DVM, or "Digital Video Multiplexor," 
is a low cost interface that allows the Apple II computer 
to be used with an RGB monitor, such as our Color-ll. 

Amdek's DVM is software programmable to allow trans- 
parent operation, and is parallel with existing Apple 
text and graphic modes. Three of its channels ore used to 
multiplex the existing Apple text, low resolution and high 
resolution graphics. The 4th channel allows the use of an 
80 character line video board. 

Our DVM is also color channel software programmable, 
enabling you to turn the three color channels on or off 
by software control. For example, the red and blue 
channel can be turned off when the 80 character 
channel is turned on, resulting in a green phosphor 
video presentation. 

For convenient operation, the DVM board may occupy 
any slot in the Apple II. The DVM also features low-power 
consumption and low-power schottky logic.

Ben Lanterman's spacey Way Ouf took first prize in the still picture category of 
Penguin's guest art contest. First place for font design went to Elizabeth Riggle for 
her font, "Laughs." 



Oracle, Part 2. There's a brand new 
winner in the Oracle arena. Part 2 was 
tough : the number of days on which snow 
would fall on Manhattan Island after 
Groundhog Day and before the first day 
of spring 1982. Meteorologist Warren 
Hatch of the National Climatic Center re- 
ported that the measurable snow rate for 
that time period at the Central Park 
weather station was twelve days. From 
the eight people tied for first place, 
the random number generator chose 
Todd Harris of New Athens, Illinois. Har- 



won Parts 2 and 5 of Oracle '81) ; Rick 
Jones, Spokane, Washington, -4.3; and 
Jean Armour, Liverpool, New York, with 
a score of -5.9. Anything can happen in 
the Oracle. 

The Art Gallery Finals. "Pardon me 
while I collapse." 

Poor Ben Lanterman, The aeronautics

eventful Friday night when Softalk 
phoned to announce that he was a con- 
test winner not once, not twice, but three 



animation category, Lanterman's The 
Present was Pelczarski's choice for sec- 
ond place. 

After his "collapse," Lanterman de- 
cided he was "floating to the ceiling" in- 
stead. Art (oil and acrylic painting) has 
been his hobby from way back, but when 
Lanterman acquired his Apple a year 
and a half ago, he started getting inter- 
ested in computer-generated graphics. 
His painting style was always fairly rigid 
and structured, "I guess I tried to paint 
too realistically," he says, "but with the

ris plans to spend his $100 on Time Zone, 
at his local store, Kappel Computer. 

The field is still wide open in the 
Oracle for the grand prize of the disk 
drive. Charles Lewis of Richmond, Vir- 
ginia, leads the race with a score of - .5. 
His wife Elizabeth was the Oracle 
Part 1 winner, but her score in the over- 
all contest is -5, trailing behind her hus- 
band. Douglas Stewart, Cape Elizabeth, 
Maine, is in second place with -1.8;

times. 

Lanterman isn't just lucky — he is im- 
mensely talented. Specter, his entry in 
Softalk's Art Gallery contest (November 
1981) , brought him a first place win in the 
computer-generated design category. 
Lanterman had also entered Penguin 
Software's guest contest in the January 
issue. Prizes were awarded for the best 
computer-generated still, best three-min- 
ute animation, and best font. Penguin's 
Mark Pelczarski independently chose 
Lanterman's Way Out for first place in 
the picture portion of that contest. In the 



computer I became impressionistic. The 
computer forces you to be freer." 

As for the eerie hooded figure of Spec- 
ter, Lanterman says that idea has been in 
his head for about ten years. He made a 
pencil drawing of it once, but it wasn't so 
frightening. However, the bright lights of 
the computer screen really brought the 
apparition to life and scared the majori- 
ty of Softalk' a readers into sending in 
their votes for it. 

Lanterman will pick up his loot at

INTRODUCING 
MKROBUFFER. 



NOW YOU CAN USE YOUR PRINTER 
WITHOUT WASTING COMPUTER TIME. 



Your computer is capable of 
sending data at thousands of 
characters per second. But the 
average printer goes no faster 
than 80 characters per second. 

This means your computer is 
forced to wait for the printer to 
finish one line before it can 
send the next. 

A waste of valuable time. 

THE HEW MKROBUFFER" 
INCREASES YOUR EFFICIEHCY. 

Microbuffer allows you to print 
and process simultaneously. 
No waiting! 

MICROBUFFER 
ACCEPTS PRIHTIHG DATA 

AS FAST AS YOUR 
COMPUTER CAH SEND IT. 

Microbuffer first stores the data 
in its own memory buffer and 
then tal<es control of your printer. 
This frees the computer for more 
productive functions. 

Additional output may be 
dumped to the buffer at any time 
and it will be printed in turn. 

IVIicrobuffer — a must for any 
program that requires printed 
output. 



PARALLEL, SERIAL OR APPLE II. 




MICROBUFFER MODEL MBP-16K™ 
is a Centronics-compatible 
parallel interface for your Epson 
printer with 16,384 bytes of on- 
board RAM for data buffering. 




MODEL MBS-8K™isafull-featured 
RS-232C serial interface for your 
Epson printer with both hard- 
ware and software (x-on/x-off) 
handshaking, baud rates from 
300 to 19,200 and a 8,192-byte 
RAM buffer. 



MICROBUFFER ll™(pictured on the 
left-hand page) is a Centronics- 
compatible parallel interface for 
the Apple II computer with up to 
32K of on-board RAM for data 
buffering as well as on-board 
firmware for text formatting and 
advanced graphics dump

Fastalk is your quick guide to popu- 
lar, specialized, or classic software. Pro- 
grams appearing in Fastalk must meet 
one or more of the following criteria: (1) 
equal or surpass in sales the least-selling 
program to appear on any of the current 
bestseller lists; (2) relate to a spe- 
cialized subject area and be in general 
distribution (more specialized packages 
and areas will be included as Fastalk ma- 
tures) ; (3) be new and of professional 
quality (such programs will be carried 
for one month only— after that, they must 
meet other criteria for inclusion; (4) 
stand out as extraordinary. 

Designation as a classic is deter- 
mined by Softalk's editors, based on a 
program's ability to stand up over time; 
on significance for its time (breaking 
new ground or introducing a new genre) ; 
or on its archetypal qualities. A classic is 
identified by a bullet preceding its title. 

Where opinion is expressed, Softalk 
has seen the software in question; when 
listing software that has been reviewed, 
the capsule is based on the review, and 
the month and year of the issue in which 
the review appeared is given at the end of 
the item. 

If you wish to refer to the original re- 
view, remember that not all reviews ap- 
pear in Marketalk; look for overview 
articles and reviews within columns such 
as Mind Your Business, Buttonwood Ap- 
ples, and Ventures with VisiCalc. 

Softalk may arbitrarily omit any 
package from Fastalk, whether or not it 
meets the foregoing criteria.

NEW Apple II terminal software 

• Z-Term "The Professional"™ by Bill Blue, for

Bill Blue, for Apple Pascal** 

• ASCII Express "The Professional"^^ by Mark

Businessmen 

Q. Do you have difficulty operating your printer when 
connected to a time-sharing computer? Are files 
you're trying to download too large for your system 
buffer? Does your host computer lose data when you 
send files to it? 

A. "The Professionals" incorporate printer ring buffers 
which allow slower printers to accept data at their 
own rates. Very large files are easily received by 
periodically saving the buffer to disk. Unlike some 
software which can lose data during disk saves, 
"The Professionals" not only direct the host to stop, 
but actually wait for it to respond before performing 
the save. After a successful save, the host is 
automatically directed to continue. This process 
may be repeated indefinitely. Lost data during send 
is virtually eliminated by the widest variety of send 
options available in any communications software. 
"The Professionals" ensure fast, reliable data trans- 
fer of any valuable business information. 



Authors 



Q. Does your line of work involve sending written 
material to others? Are you a program author who 
would like to send work In progress to a partner or 
client and know that it arrived intact? What would 
the ability to instantly send material or programs to 
anyone at any time be worth to you? 

A. "The Professionals" provide the ideal way to send 
your articles, manuscripts, reports, programs and 
technical documents to another computer with 
phone line access. Now you can work WHEREVER 
you want, and be assured that your data is sent to its 
destination quickly and error-free. In fact, compared 
to the fastest mail services, "The Professionals" of- 
fer immediate delivery and will save you the pur- 
chase price in just a few uses. 



Students 



Are you bothered by limited access to your school's 
existing terminals? Would you like to be able to do 
your school assignments at home at your own con- 
venience? 

"The Professionals" allow you to access virtually 
any dial-up school or college computer system over 
standard telephone lines. This means no more 
waiting in line for an available terminal or hassles 
with malfunctioning school equipment. You can 
even prepare term papers or reports while off-line 
and send the completed work to the school com- 
puter for final printing. Best of all, you can work from 
home at the times most convenient for you.

Time Share Users 

Q. Are you tired of wasting time and money sending or 
receiving files with inadequate, poorly designed 
software? Do you find yourself manually performing 
the same lengthy log-in procedures over and over 
again? Would you like to automate these procedures 
for yourself and others? 

A. "The Professionals" allow you to send files which 
have been prepared in advance. They may then be 
transferred at any time, as quickly as possible — 
even to several different systems. No time is 
wasted reviewing information while on line; data may 
be captured by your computer or printer (or both) to 
be evaluated later at your convenience. These fea- 
tures assure minimum on-line time and therefore 
minimum on-line cost. 

"The Professionals" introduce macros that are more 
sophisticated than anything previously seen In com- 
munications software. These "hand-shaking" mac- 
ros allow you to perform complete multi-stage log-on 
sequences automatically; all you do is specify the 
system to be called. This eliminates sign-on errors 
and greatly simplifies operation of the entire system, 
not only for you, but for other less skilled operators. 

Bulletin Boards 

Q. Would you like to be able to take advantage of the in- 
formation featured on local bulletin boards and infor- 
mation services such as The Source, CompuServe, 
Dow Jones, and others? 

A. "The Professionals" open the world of modem com- 
munication networks to you. There are already 
thousands of these systems and networks in use na- 
tionwide. "The Professionals" provide an ideal way 
of accessing these systems. All 80 column boards, 
external terminals (even the 40 column screen), and 
currently available communications devices are fully 
supported, including the Hayes Micromodem II and 
Novation Apple CAT. All standard baud rates — 110, 
300, 1200 and others — are fully supported; BAUDOT 
too, if your computer is equipped with the Apple CAT 
modem. 



Clubs 



Q. Are there other Apple owners with whom you would 
like to exchange programs or files, but have been 
unable to do so because of limitations imposed by 
the software you now use? 

A. Any two Apples equipped with "The Professionals" 
can transfer ANY type or size file with complete error 
checking and correction. All of "The Professional" 
packages are fully conversant with each other and 
operate almost identically. For the first time ever, 
you can transfer compatible files to an operating 
system different from yours — error free!

Your Apple can run on its own 
with automatic dial, answer and 
disconnect. The system uses your

line charges are lowest. 



And the variety of speeds 
available lets you save even more. 
Switch from the standard 110 or 300 
baud to 1200 baud (it's 202 compat-

Testimonial of a Compulsive Buyer 

I am a compulsive software buyer when 
it involves programs that I can use. The 
problem is that I keep buying different 
programs for the same purpose, as each 
seems better and promises to do more 
than the one I have. It is very helpful to 
come to a decision when Softalk does ar- 
ticles and comparisons of these pro- 
grams. On occasion I purchase a pro- 
gram on my own after reading an article 
or advertisement in Softalk. 

About a year ago I read in Softalk 
about the PEAR System, a program for 
investors and stock brokers. I bought the 
program even though I had other similar 
programs and have never been happier. 
It does everything they claimed it would. 

Now the compulsive buyer (me) 
reads the full page advertisement about 
Zardax the word processor in your mag- 
azine. I have two already. Who needs an- 
other one? Well, I'm not too happy with 
the two I have. Perhaps it is because I 
really need simple programs with 
manuals that don't require a degree in 
computer science to understand. I still 
haven't passed chapter three in Visi- 
Calc. Back to Zardax. After an unsuc- 
cessful search to find Zardax (what's 
that?), my local, friendly Computerland 
special-ordered it for me. After one week- 
end with the program I am looking for 
anyone to write to, even testimonials. It's 
that great. 

It really would help all Apple owners 
if the readers of Softalk would write to 
tell when they are pleased, and at the 
same time it would show their apprecia- 
tion to the developers of good software. 
Jack Appel, Palm Beach, FL 

Mooning for Slipshod's Hi-Res Cows 

About your magazine, I enjoy the col- 
umns on Assembler, the contests, and the 
top thirty list. How about expanding the 
top thirty to a top one hundred list, since 
it seems that quite a few of your readers 
like reading the list? You might also in- 
clude a reader poll of software, much like 
Consumer Reports has a reader poll on 
movies. 

Speaking of reviews, I really think they 
should be a little bit more critical than 
they are. What about saying whether or 
not the game is worth the price? For in- 
stance. Suicide! is an interesting diver- 
sion, but it isn't worth $29.95 to me. 

About software pricing and piracy, I 
don't think manufacturers of software 
will be able to lower their price for one 
disk unless they deal in much greater 
volume; they have to make it worth 
everybody's while to produce/distrib- 
ute/stock the product, and if the price for 
a piece of software goes much below 
what it is, there won't be enough of the 
pie for everybody to have a piece. So 
what can they do? Well, instead of just 
having one game on a disk, why not do 
the following: Include on the disk with 
the main attraction two or three older 
games that may not be advanced enough

Discussion 



for today's competitive market, sort of 
like the old double feature at the movies 
that also included newsreels and such. 

While leaving a local computer store 
last week, a large man smelling of fried 
corn stepped up to me and asked me if I 
could be trusted to send a letter to Sof- 
talk for him. I asked him why he couldn't 
send it himself, and he muttered briefly 
about a lawsuit using up his spare 
change, then walked away. Here is the 
letter he handed me to deliver, and I 
think it speaks for itself. 
Brent Iverson, Boca Raton, FL 

The Mysterious Letter 
I was generally pleased with your re- 
view of Cropduster, but there are a few 
things that I think I should say about the 
game. 

You mentioned that running into power 
lines at 3000 feet was annoying, raising 
the possibility that a few bugs had found 
their way into the program. Rest assured 
that we dust each disk for bugs before we 
send it out. These are not bugs that you 
mention, but rather they are features. 
Uriah has asked me to note that he wrote 
Cropduster not only in C0B0L=13, but 
also in such languages as Fortran, Basic, 
APL, Pascal, and Forth. In fact, every 
single one of Cropduster's two hundred 
interlocking programs is written in a dif- 
ferent language. This was the result of a 
bet that eventually turned out to be very 
costly for Uriah's brother, Irving M. 
Stukk. After the 183rd program, Uriah 
ran out of programming languages to 
use. So he invented a few of his own, and 
took it upon himself to write interpreters 
and compilers for each one of them. One 
of these languages is CDSEL, an acro- 
nym for Crop Duster Spraying Effects 
Language. This language is primarily of 
value for determining the effects of 
chemical spraying on crops in the 
Midwest. Possible uses for this language 
include a hi-res arcade-like business sim- 
ulation, a businesslike hi-res arcade sim- 
ulation, a simulation of a hi-res arcade 
business, and an example of a special- 
ized programming language. 

YAPL is an acronym for Yet Another 
Programming Language. This may be 
the ultimate language for people who 
don't like structured languages. It does 
nearly everything tiny Basic does, ex- 
cept more slowly. Examples of state- 
ments peculiar to this language are the 
If/Then/Maybe statement for program- 
mers who don't like their programs to be 
too predictable, and the forget state- 
ment, which is obviously the opposite of 
the rem statement. Actually, we haven't 
found a use for either of these constructs 



yet, but Uriah is rather proud of the fact 
that no other language has them. 

The lawsuit against our company has 
made our operations difficult and has 
caused us to delay our plan of opening 
Cropdusterland, a theme amusement 
park (to be located in Summit, SD) for at 
least a few decades. We have, however, a 
plan that we hope will recoup much of the 
losses we may suffer from this lawsuit. 
We are suing ourselves, claiming that 
our game, Cropduster, is a direct steal 
from our game, Cropduster. In case the 
opposition hires a lawyer who has taken 
some law courses, or in the event that our 
plan fails for any other reason, we have 
made other plans. As long as we are be- 
ing sued, Uriah suggested, why not make 
it worth the opposition's while. (We won't 
deign to mention the name of this belliger- 
ent arcade game manufacturer.) To this 
end, we are planning to release, over the 
next few months. Battle-area, Meteor- 
oids. Missile Commander, Blue Baron, 
Warring Lords, and Centipede Wars. All 
of these feature, if only briefly, hi-res 
cows. To induce a few other arcade man- 
ufacturers to join in the fun, we are also

developing Pac-Person, Cosmic Star- 
gate Defender, Galacticans, and Spaced- 
out Invaders. 

Also in the works are a few games that 
we feel incorporate revolutionary new 
concepts in computer gaming. One of the 
ones we will be proudest to release is 
Software Pirate. This game is similar, at 
least in appearance, to several games 
put out by Automated Simulations a few 
years back. The player starts out by buy- 
ing an Apple computer. With this com- 
puter and his few remaining dollars, he 
ventures into the dungeons of Realworld. 
There he meets other Apple owners who, 
he hopes, he can persuade to exchange 
software with him, he then searches for 
the various bit and nibble copy pro- 
grams hidden around the dungeon. He 
must also beware of the agents of Kilo- 
baud the Green, who seek to turn him in 
for Kilobaud's Reward. The eventual ob- 
ject of the game is to get out of the dun- 
geon with as much pirated software as 
possible. However, the real game on the 
disk is the disk itself. The owner of the 
disk is challenged to produce a working 
copy of the disk using any method he de- 
sires. The first person to mail a pirated, 
working copy of Software Pirate to us 
will win one hundred dollars, and a full- 
time job as Slipshod's software protec- 
tion specialist. 

Thank you for your time. May your 
harvest be bug-free and your programs 
the same.

In a Spin To Win 

I am writing to you to respond to a letter 
written by Adam Behrens about Wizard- 
ry. I received my copy one week ago and 
have only stopped playing to eat. Mr. 
Behrens stated in his letter that he had 
trouble with bugs in Wizardry, especial- 
ly in the Training Grounds and the Utili- 
ty Options. I have not tried every Utility 
Option, but every one I tried worked fine. 
My version of Wizardry is the January 
2.1 version. The only example Mr. Behr- 
ens gives is when his Wizardry disk spins 
indefinitely. This is almost always not a 
software problem, but a case of a mis- 
aligned disk drive. What you do is go 
down to your local Apple Computer 
dealer and have your disk drives tuned 
up. Wizardry is an excellent game and a 
good example of what an Apple can do 
when it has the right software. See you in 
the second screnario: Knight of Dia- 
monds.

Murderous Mansion Still on Rampage 

Today I received your April issue of Sof- 
talk and was reading through it when I 
came across a letter from Reed Hubbard 
of Jackson, Mississippi, regarding Crans- 
ton Manor. To be sure, this game does 
not deserve the bad rating that he gave it. 
You see, I am the person that he talked to 



at On-Line Systems. While Mr. Crans- 
ton's spirit is never seen, his influence is 
felt in the fact that there are strange 
forces in the house, i.e. a suit of armour 
that won't let you get items, and some- 
thing controlling the computer in the 
labjrrinth downstairs. 

I'm glad to see that Mr. Hubbard was 
able to solve the game so quickly and 
with such little help. There are others out 
there who can't. Not every game is 
meant for everyone. Apparently Reed 
found a game that was not a challenge to 
him. That hardly makes his scathing re- 
marks justifiable. 

Not an hour after I read his letter, a 
mother called me for some clues on 
Cranston Manor for her son. She had 
nothing but the highest praise for the 
game. Considering that she called long 
distance, she obviously felt that it wasn't 
the easiest thing in the world. In fact, I 
receive many questions each day con- 
cerning this adventure from people who 
are stumped and in need of help. 

Perhaps Reed was a little over- 
zealous in writing his letter and refer- 
ring to twenty-five rooms in the manor. 
You see, I count over thirty rooms in the 
house, over thirty rooms in the labyrinth 
in the basement, and over thirty rooms 
outside. That hardly adds up to only 
twenty-five rooms. This totals to about a 
hundred rooms in the game, which gives 
a more accvirate picture of what is really 
contained on the Cranston Manor disk- 
ette. 

In checking the April issue of Softalk 
we find that Cranston Manor has ranked 
fourth consecutively for at least two 
months. That kind of popularity is not 
achieved through false advertising. 
Games that achieve this status do so 
through word of mouth of satisfied cus- 
tomers. My purpose in writing this is not 
to harass Mr. Hubbard but rather to set 
the record straight. 

Reed brought up an interesting 
thought, that of rating the games by 
levels of difficulty ; an idea of that nature 
could have merit. Unfortunately, we do 
not all experience game difficulty in the 
same manner. Perhaps a large number 
of players could independently rate each 
game and then take an average, or have 
companies list the difficulty level of each 
of their own games, giving them in order 
from easiest to the most challenging. It's 
something to think about. 

If there are people out there who are 
finding it difficult to locate a challenging 
game, I'm certain that Time Zone will 
challenge their creative imagination. It 
can't be solved in just a few hours. I've 
played it twice, the first time with Ro- 
berta Williams, its creator. This game 
took over a year and a half to develop and 
has over 1200 pictures. Since then I've de- 
veloped a glossary consisting of twenty 
pages of definitions for Time Zone, along 
with refined maps for the thirty-nine time 
zones that you can visit. Begfinning May

Helpfully One Step Beyond 

I just received the April issue of Softalk 
and wanted to relay to you a compliment 
of the fine article with the explanation of 
the Dow Jones Market Analyser pro- 
gram. I was able to see a demonstration 
of this new program at an investment 
seminar on its introduction and agree 
with you that it is an excellent "value" 
package. However, rather than pur- 
chase this program, I decided to go one 
step further and I purchased the On Bal- 
ance Volume Charting program by Stock 
Market Software Inc. that uses Joseph 
Granville's On-Balance Volume concept. 
For the past year I have been running a 
similar program called Stock Tracker by 
H&H Trading Company, and now I have 
the two programs running in parallel, 
along with tracking other technical data 
and indicators. If I can be of any assist- 
ance in providing information on docu- 
mentation or problem solving of these 
programs, I would be happy to do so.

Personal Investing with Options 

To Ken Landis: I have enjoyed your 
column in Softalk as I am scheduled to 
teach an adult education class about 
home computers and their use in person- 
al investing programs. 

In preparation for this eight-week 
class, I have written to companies that 
offer software for this application. Some 
have sold me demo disks, other have re- 
fused any assistance, and one (Options- 
80) loaned me their unlocked program. I 
urge you to include this program in your 
schedule for review. My limited exper- 
ience with it is very positive. It is design- 
ed to do the messy math associated with 
options but leaves the decisions to the

sions, the prime rate; it can also plot the 
results, such as annualized percent gain 
versus annualized percent growth in 
share value for six different strategies in 
both puts and calls. The graphs can also 
be printed via any printer with graphics 
capability. Two negative comments I 
have so far are that only one disk drive is 
supported and the graphs cannot be la- 
beled to identify the company or identify 
the three different plots. Since the origi- 
nal program is in Applesoft, these short- 
comings would be corrected. 

I look forward to your continuing

Utopia Calling Earth 

Not to prolong a controversy that does 
not exist, I feel I should offer some infor- 
mation regarding The Utopia Graphics 
Tablet System and Special Delivery Soft- 



ware as the latter pertains to the former. 

There is really no argument with the 
assertion that the manual is inadequate. 
The system's method of operation is 
based on a paintbox program developed 
on a mainframe at the New York Insti- 
tute of Technology by Alvy Ray Smith 
and others. If a manual exists for this 
system, I have not seen it. Ampex Cor- 
poration manufactures a unit that is 
based on the NVIT model and no fin- 
ished manual exists for this either. These 
systems, as well as the Utopia system, 
are menu driven and the user, particu- 
larly the inexperienced user, is encour- 
aged to spend the time normally applied 
leafing through a manual to experiment 
with the system until an understanding of 
its scope and operation is acquired. This 
is not meant to excuse the inadequacies 
of the manual but to point out the fact 
that one does not learn to use these sys- 
tems by reading the manual, but by 
hands-on experience. 

Secondly, Special Delivery Software, 
though marketed by Apple, is not devel- 
oped in-house and retains a second class 
status with regard to quality controls. Al- 
though many shortcomings of the line 
have been or are intended to be over- 
come, at the time that the Utopia system 
was released certain shortcuts com- 
promised the quality of the manual, to 
wit: poor print quality, cheap materials 
and binding, styleless and thoughtless 



typesetting (note the absence of the little 
stop signs and pointing fingers charac- 
teristic of Apple's front line manuals), 
and inadequate proofreading which, in 
the case of our manual, caused one chap- 
ter to be tacked onto the end of another 
with no heading and no indication of the 
shortcut in the table of contents. 

I do not know a programmer brash 
enough to claim that he has written a pro- 
gram of any substance that is com- 
pletely bug free. There is no practical 
way to prove this claim as there will 
always be a user that can find a way to 
use the program that will expose some 
unforeseen weakness. The Special Deliv- 
ery version of the Utopia system is ac- 
tually 9 major programs and several util- 
ity modules which, because of memory 
constraints, must sometimes alter 
pointers on the fly. Under normal condi- 
tions, a delicate balance will cause the 
system to operate with the appearance of 
normalcy. 

Apple released and then recalled ap- 
proximately 1000 copies of the program 
for the following reason: Apple's copy 
protection scheme does not allow the 
usage of "exec" files, upon which the sys- 
tem's memory management depended. 
Although Apple tested and approved the 
system as submitted, they neglected to 
test a copy protected version, resulting in 
the recall. Rather than inform Utopia 
Software of the problem, someone at Ap-

pie altered the code to make it opera- 
tional and the system was rereleased. 
Any subsequent problems with the soft- 
ware may, at least in part, be attributed 
to these more or less kluged modifica- 
tions which may or may not have been 
field tested with the same efficiency as 
the original version. Such changes will 
affect the animation program in particu- 
lar since it operates from a different part 
of memory than most of the other pro- 
grams. 

Regarding Mr. Blum's contention that 
"sketch" and "line" are incompatible 
when tracing: Line mode, as well as 
every other function except for sketch, 
operates within a fixed scale. Sketch is 
the only function intended for tracing. Al- 
though Mr. Blum may consider this a de- 
sign flaw, it is not a bug. Anyone who is 
satisfied with the five drawing functions 
available with the original tablet soft- 
ware does not have to deal with this triv- 
iality in trading off for a broader range of 
artist oriented functions. There are not 
enough little boxes on the tablet overlay 
to define the options available. This is 
why the system is screen oriented and 
why there is little consideration paid to 
tracing. 

I do not intend for this to appear as an 
indictment of Apple Special Delivery 
Software, nor as an alibi for any flaws 
that may exist as a result of program- 
ming iniquities. I have faith that Apple, 
being the best small computer manufac- 
turer in the business, will not let any- 
thing with the Apple name on it remain in 
question for long. Quite frankly, I have 
not kept up with the progress of my pro- 
gram for two basic reasons. Firstly, I am 
in the midst of an extensive rewrite of the 
entire system including extensions and 
improvements too numerous to detail 
here. Secondly, Special Delivery Soft- 
ware's license to the system is being 
mutually terminated in the near future, 
not because of a lack of faith in Apple's 
ability to rectify any problems, but be- 
cause individual programs in the cata- 
log, particularly specialized ones such as 
this one, can not get the attention they 
need (customer servicing, advertising, 
etc.). Roger Powell and I are founding 
Utopia Software Distribution to deal with 
this problem and by the end of 1982 hope 
to have an initial release of graphic, 
music and utility programs including the 
revised graphic system in tablet and joy- 
stick versions, all of which will be exten- 
sively documented and copyable. 

Finally, I would like to thank Saul 
Bernstein for his support of the system 
and Brooke Boering for coming to our de- 
fense. In composing this letter, I am test- 
ing for the first time Brooke's documen- 
tation editor, Arthur, and must say that 
he is the friendliest little typesetter I 
have had the pleasure to work with 
(Arthur, not Brooke).

A Good Paddling 

Upon receiving our April Softalk, we 
were very unhappy to see our product 
misrepresented in Hardtalk. Our former 
distributor failed to submit the proper 
photos and thus the product shown in the 
inset is not the current Pro Paddle de- 
sign. The design was changed as shown 
in the accompanying photo. This was 
done primarily to accomodate people 




with larger hands and still keep Pro Pad- 
dles as compact as possible. This change 
was made in November 1981. 

In general nothing was said about the 
obvious qualities of the Pro Paddle. The 
approach of the review seemed swift at 
best. Pro Paddles have always had the 
switch numbers hot stamped on the 
switch buttons so users won't have to 
guess, decode colors, or perhaps biblical 
names to find out which paddle they are 
holding. The switch we use is of the high- 
est quality and rated at one million cy- 
cles. The play in the switch button is off- 
set by the fact that the switch will fire 
with light pressure from almost any point 
on the one-half inch square button with- 
out binding. This may take getting used 
to for those who enjoy a night of comput- 
er games with gritting teeth and stiff 
shoulders. 

Pro Paddle knobs are high quality 
brass-collet type mounted on a long life 
mini pot. We make the only game 
paddles with a three- wire shielded cable, 
epoxied into an extra-heavy-duty dip plug 
for flexibility, noise/interference pro- 
tection and long life. The cables exit from 
the rear of the unit, away from the action 
of the hands. Each set comes with four 
adhesive rubber feet for placement on a 
flat surface or on the computer. 

Although it is not our intention to turn 
this rebuttal into an ad for Pro Paddles, 
we feel the article was somewhat mis- 
leading. Considering Mr. Mazur's in- 
volvement with the highest-rated paddles, 
one cannot be sure of the authenticity of 
the review. This is especially evident 
when we consider the review in Softalk's 
Marketalk column, September 1981; 
"... Their speed and accuracy are out- 
standing and a plastic square finger-sized 
button means total comfort. . . .", ". . . 
Albeit the trial lasted only a few weeks. 
Pro Paddles showed no sign of weaken- 
ing." 

We thank Mr. Mazur for his prompt

Switch Without a Difference 
To Jeff Mazur: I am employed by The 
Keyboard Company in Garden Grove, 
CA, and I thought you might be interest- 
ed in a market study we did regarding 
the Hand Controller II for the Apple II. In 
your article you stated, "The placement 
of this switch was the only shortcoming 
found in these paddles and if you were 
left-handed or if you didn't mind oper- 
ating the switch with your fingers, these 
paddles had a lot to offer." Prior to prod- 
uct introduction we did a market sur- 
vey of two separate prototypes with the 
switch on the right and the left side. We 
found that initially the position of the 
switch did make a difference, however, 
the preference had no correlation on 
whether you were right or left-handed, 
then, after the people used it for awhile, it 
made little or no difference as to what 
side the button was on. 

Also, you mentioned our Joystick n 
and talked about the toggle switch that 
controls input number one. We are plan- 
ning on a new design that will eliminate 
the rocker switch and use two fire but- 



tons. This should make playing Raster 

Blaster a lot easier.

Buttons Up, Thumbs Down 

To Jeff Mazur: The A2D Company was 
pleased to see your review of its joystick 
and game paddles in your April issue of 
Softalk. We do use high quality compo- 
nents as indicated in your review. Unfor- 
tunately, after reading the review, your 
readers may be left with an erroneous 
impression concerning the placement of 
buttons on our products. As shown in 
our brochures, our products are de- 
signed to be hand held with the fingers 
activating the buttons. Thus, the buttons 
are in the front of the case not in the rear 
as stated in your article. Trying to acti- 
vate the buttons with the thumb as was 
apparently done in your evaluation would 
be quite awkward as you stated, since the 
product was not designed for use in this 
manner. We at A2D have enjoyed read- 
ing Softalk and watching your magazine 
improve in its breadth and quality.

A Case of "Finesse" Elbow 
I read with great interest Craig Stinson's 
"Home Finance Roundup" (April '82). I 
also read with g^reat interest his articles 
a year ago on the same subject and was 
disappointed with the outcome. The prob- 
lem is that I don't know who I am disap- 



pointed with : Craig Stinson for his evalu- 
ation. Spectrum Software for their prod- 
uct, or myself for expecting more from 
commercially purchased software. 

For many years I have been keeping 
track of my monthly bills in a small 
ledger. I eventually wanted to use the Ap- 
ple for this purpose but didn't want to 
take time to write the program. That's 
when I read your April and May '81 arti- 
cles on home finance packages. It 
seemed Spectrum Software's Home Fi- 
nance Pak I was what I'd been looking 
for! I purchased the software and took it 
home ready to automate my monthly bill 
keeping. I'll admit that the program did 
everything your evaluation and Spec- 
trum said it would, however, it lacked 
class. There were also some basic crite- 
ria I feel should be followed should one 
sell software. Let me explain. 

My first purchased software was 
from an Apple users club. It consisted of 
three programs: a programming utility, 
a text editor, and a mailing list. They 
were filled with error handling routines 
onerr goto and user messages, were easy 
to use, and the displays were pleasing to 
the eye. The best part was the cost of 
each program, about twenty dollars. 

The Spectrum package had no error 
handling and few messages to tell the 
user what it was doing. There were mis- 
spelled words ("menue" for menu, "en- 
per" for enter), gotos that went nowhere 
(fortunately the lines are not called) , no

trailing zeros on reports, and an over- 
abundance of flashing and inverse video. 
The Hello program asks for the printer 
slot and RAM size and then hardcodes 
slot 5 and 48K into its system parame- 
ters display. It does, however, use the 
printer slot variable in the actual pro- 
gram. The RAM size is never used. The 
Home Finance Pak I cost more than 
twice any of the other mentioned pro- 
grams and had less than half the class 
(or finesse as Craig Stinson calls it). 

So you see my dilemma. Should I be 
disappointed with you for not being more 
in-depth with your reviews, with Spec- 
trum Software for not cleaning up their 
product, or with myself for expecting a 
fifty dollar program to exceed a twenty 
dollar one? One positive note did come 
out of this learning experience. I wrote 
my own bill-keeping program. It was up 
and running in a short time. Since then I 
have been giving it "finesse." Who 
knows, maybe I'll sell it for twenty dol- 
lars. 

George L. Cox, Jr., Colorado Springs, CO 

Double Entry Oversight 

A year ago you published a review of 
home finance packages. For some rea- 
son, you decided to review only "single 
entry" systems. This past January, you 
reviewed accounting packages in the 
Mind Your Business section. In that re- 
view, Peter Olivieri included The Ac- 
countant Finance Data Base System, a 
double entry system intended primarily 
for use in the home or a small business. 
The review praised The Accountant and 
concluded that "For the home user (and 
perhaps in some less complex small busi- 
nesses), the best package we evaluated 
was The Accountant by Decision Support 
Software. The documentation was very 
well done, programs were easy to use, 
and design was thorough and complete." 

DSS was delighted that Softalk had 
recognized that a home finance package 
need not be just a limited single entry 
system. However, your April issue in- 
cluded another "Home Finance Round- 
up," which claimed to review home fin- 
ance programs — single-entry account- 
ing systems intended primarily for use in 
the home or in small businesses." We will 
not argue with the results of the review, 
but do have great difficulty with your im- 
plication that a home finance package 
must be single-entry. The Accountant 
was designed to provide the full capabili- 
ties of a double entry system to users who 
do not know a debit from a credit. 

Many users of The Accountant had pre- 
viously tried single-entry systems and 
found them to be too limiting. Most users 
of The Accountant do not know how to 
debit or credit but, nevertheless, find the 
double entry process easy to use because 
of the special prompting provided by The 
Accountant. A double entry system is 
uniform in its approach to every type of 
transaction. Uniformity is an important 



characteristic that makes systems easi- 
er to learn and easier to use. Single entry 
systems usually have different proce- 
dures for entering checks, cash, and 
credit card transactions. Transactions 
that do not involve one of these three 
categories (such as recording wages 
withheld for federal taxes) may not even 
be permitted at all. Inconsistencies and 
errors can arise easily in single entry 
systems. A double entry system has 
enough redundancy to prevent inconsis- 
tencies and thwart errors. Yoiir review- 
ers and readers should be concerned with 
the sacrifices in ease of use and perform- 
ance that a double entry system requires 
in order to provide the increased flexibil- 
ity and consistency. We have purposely 
not designed The Accountant as an auto- 
mated version of a manual double entry 
system. Such a system would clearly not 
be suitable for home use. Instead, we 
have used the capabilities of the micro- 
computer to make the double entry pro- 
cess straightforward to the layperson. 
We leave it to the reviewers and users to 
judge the success of our approach. All we 
ask is that you not dismiss The Account- 
ant from consideration for a home fi- 
nance package on the basis of it not be- 
ing a single entry system.

Crystal Clarifies 

In response to Mr. Davis's letter, I would 
like to make the following comments: 

1. We believe our current versions of 
Apple and Atari software to be free of 
major program errors. 

2. Consumers may replace any 
program purchased within the last thirty 
days through an authorized dealer. 

3. All sales and service are now be- 
ing handled by our over 3,000 dealers 
throughout the world. If you would like 
the name of your local dealer call (408) 
778-2966. 

4. Crystalware is a corporation and 
employs many individuals In many coun- 
tries. Hollywood Marketing will be set- 
ting up a factory for Crystalware In On- 
tario next month. 

5. It Is usually policy to ignore small 
independent (less than 40,000) publica- 
tion's editorial comments. The products 
speak for themselves in originality, con- 
cept, and design. 

John Bell, President, 
Crystalware Inc., Morgan Hill, CA 

Softalk received word recently from 
John Bell that Crystalware may be going 
out of business. Fans of Crystalware 
products may take heart, however; at 
the Applefest held in mid-May, some of 
John Bell's programs were being distrib- 
uted under the U.F.O. label.

other computer magazine and I've tried 
just about all of them. I won't say that I 
like all the articles, as sometimes I disa- 
gree with what is said, but do enjoy them 
nonetheless. I will be continuing my sub- 
scription (paid) when the time arrives. 

My main reason for writing, how- 
ever, is in hopes that you will publish this 
letter so that others will be aware mainly 
of incomplete advertising and poor pub- 
lisher response. 

I wrote a letter to Personal Software 
Inc., now VisiCorp. 

I have as yet not received my re- 
placement disks, the delay was unneces- 
sary as noted in my second letter. 

VisiCorp did not really answer any of 
my questions nor offer any assistance 
with my problems except that the Visi- 
File program will not support a multi- 
disk file. The fact that a program will or 
will not support multidisk files is a key 
factor in determining whether or not to 
buy that program. Visicorp did not re- 
veal this important shortcoming in their 
VisiFile ads, nor in their letter directly to 
me announcing the program, nor did 
they reveal any of the other shortcom- 
ings I am having problems with. 

There are a few things I feel are im- 
portant that other prospective buyers be 
made aware of. Space between printed 
fields must be 2 or more, and the pro- 
gram will single space only. If extra 
spaces are forced via printer control, 
then the header and total lines also have 
extra spaces. Reports always print a 
page number on its own line, a heading 
line (blank or otherwise), a solid line 
across the page, for a total of three lines, 
like it or not. Flies can only be appended 
in a roundabout, time consuming proce- 
dure. When printing files, the disk drive 
is in continuous operation. This is a lot of 
wear on the disk and the drive, some- 
times exceeding one hoixr on a full disk of 
one line in sequence records. 

There is no way to catalog a disk with- 
out leaving the program. There is also no 
way to check disk space without leaving 
the program. This can be critical on long 
files. The program is extremely slow in 
internal change of functions, often read- 
ing and writing unknown data three or 
four times for unknown reasons. For ex- 
ample, fifty-six seconds elapsed between 
selections print and the notice appearing 
on the screen that one can now print. 
Fifty-six seconds is a long time at Apple 
speed. 

When maintaining files, if an error is 
made in entering the record number and 
an attempt is made to correct the error, 
the program will accept only the first dig- 
it of the correction. The program also 
automatically searches for a four digit 
record number upon entry of the fourth 
digit. No correction is possible. 

VisiFile is my third program pur- 
chased from VisiCorp, the other two be- 
ing CCA Data Management and Visi- 
Calc. VisiCorp is well aware of these pur- 
chases but put forth almost no effort to 



help me with my problems. It is this atti- 
tude that I have often read about but 
never expected from such a well-known 
and respected company, or am I wrong 
about the respected part? It is fortunate 
for me that I purchased a backup set of 
program disks when I first purchased 
VisiFile, otherwise, I would still be un- 
able to process my files. 

All in all, the input portion of VisiFile 
is outstanding and extremely flexible, 
however, the output is slow and rather in- 
flexible as far as page formatting is con- 
cerned. Report formatting is flexible 
enough but not the printing thereof. A 
data management program as expensive 
as VisiFile and designed to handle only a 
one-disk file is to me a fraud, that it fur- 
ther is so inflexible as to spacing, head- 
ing, and column control is to add insult to 
injury. VisiFile is a great improvement 
over CCA Data Management but does not 
compare to the usability of VisiCalc. I 
feel VisiCorp so sophisticated the pro- 
gram that they didn't leave any room for 
simple procedures which are always a 
part of any data processing function. One 
of the best ways to check data entry is a 
double spaced printout just as the data 
exists on the disk, no spaces, and this 
simple procedure cannot be done via 
VisiFile. 

I think that as a reader service on fu- 
ture program evaluations it would be a 
good thing to make a list of those things 
that this type of program would nor- 



mally be expected to perform, but does 
not. This would also be a good thing for 
hardware evaluations. For example, I or- 
dered the Prometheus Versacard and 
upon reading the instructions found out 
that the next two lower slots had to be va- 
cant. I wanted this four- function card 
mainly to save slots and the ads seemed 
to indicate this was possible, but it is not. 
I exchanged it for Mountain Computer's 
MFC, but it arrived minus the installa- 
tion and operation instructions so I'm still 
not sure if it needs empty slots or not. 
This has taken nearly four months and 
still I do not have a time card in opera- 
tion.

Holy Toledo 

At last the whistle has been blown on Bert 
Kersey. Our neighborhood has known for 
years that the driving force behind 
Beagle Brothers, at least since Uncle 
Louie retired, has been Sophie. Well 
known to us, for example, is that while 
Bert designs most of the graphics used in 
those cramped Beagle ads, it is Sophie 
who makes up the programs, using the 
special pad-sensitive raised-letter key- 
board created (I believe) out of used tiles 
from Tecate. No doubt Bert himself was 
responsible for the recent DOStalk but, 
alas, it is full of errors as no doubt other 
readers have told you. The most obvious 
is that "DOS" does not rhyme with 
"Boss" but rather with "Toledo", and

anyway if the good Lord wanted us to

in line 10 of Bert's public domain pro-

is not only illogical reasoning but there 
are also unpardonable errors in syntax;

I've been receiving Softalk since its be-

azine and getting even better! I enjoyed 
DOStalk in the April issue and thought I'd 
share with your readers a change I made 
to Bert Kersey's Decimal Disassembler 
program. The following program lines, 
when added to the original program will 
convert negative numbers (such as 
-16384) to positive before conversion to 
hex.

MIDS (ST$,A,1): NEXT A 

160 ST = 65535 - VAL (AS) 

170 VTAB 24: CALL - 868: PRINT AS; " IS THE 

SAME AS" ;ST;: FOR A = 1 TO 1200: NEXT A: 

GOTO 50 

Keep up the good work.

Designing Talking Tool 

A comprehensive statistical analysis 
package which is completely conversa- 
tional in operation would be a valuable 
tool for researchers and others with lim- 
ited access to large computers. I am in 
the process of creating such a package 
and would like to hear from others with 
the interest in, and competence for, co- 
authoring such a program in Applesoft. 
Anyone interested should contact Mr. 
Charles F. Cicciarella at the Division of 
Physical Education, UNC- Greensboro, 
Greensboro, NC, at their earliest con- 
venience.

Kitchen Help 

Help! Since programs along these lines 
are virtually nonexistent in my locale, I 
would appreciate hearing from anyone 
who utilzies the Apple for any food or diet 
program, especially diabetic programs; 
and also for recipe storage, or any 
kitchen related program. 

I am also interested in learning if 
there is a simple way to get Apple's SDS 
Diet Analysis to give a printout. How 



about adding foods to the composition 
disk? Any input from Softalk readers 
would be greatly appreciated. 
Mrs. Ray Gada Jr., Modesto, CA 

Colors and Clubs 

I would like to ask if you have any infor- 
mation on the Apple II in regard to the 
color kill on text and also, how to receive 
the additional four hi-res colors which 
are available on newer models. I have 
heard that there is an Apple bulletin 
available concerning this problem. 1 1 
have not been able to locate a copy of the 
document. I would appreciate it if you 
have any information which might solve 
the problem. Also, if you have any infor- 
mation regarding an Apple club in my 
area, I would like their name and ad- 
dress.

A Taxing Situation 

To Peter Olivieri: HELP! I have an 
Apple. I purchased it the summer of 1979, 
nearly three years ago. Last month I 
started a business, called Skysoft Enter- 
prises, in conjunction with a software 
package I am marketing; I do consult- 
ing work, and muster any revenue I can 
from writing articles. I now use my Ap- 
ple strictly for business, mainly because 
I don't have time for anything else. 

How can I depreciate my Apple as a 
business expense? What will the IRS ac- 
cept? I figure the fair way to do it is es- 
tablish the fair market value for the 
Apple in 1982 through ads for used equip- 
ment and depreciate from there, but fair- 
ness has never been one of the virtues of 
our beloved bureaucracy. 
Michael Schuyler, Kingston, WA 

A Soft Appeal for Basic Charity 
I am interested in translating some In- 
teger Basic program listings I have into 
Applesoft. I need to know what the com- 
mand "MOD" and the symbol "#" mean. 
I appeal to any charitable editor or read- 
er knowledgeable in Integer Basic for the 
answers.

Ill's Good Company 
I have been receiving Softalk since you 
started publishing it and mailing it free to 
Apple owners. I would like to commend 
you for your decision in having articles 
and columns about the Apple III in your 
magazine. I am a former Apple II owner 
and I am also one of those who bought an 
Apple III when things with it were not so 
good. Fortunately those days are gone, 
and I find the Apple III now even more 
reliable than my old Apple II. 

The article in your April issue by John 
Jeppson about the character sets in the 
Apple III is very informative. It is also 
useful, and it works. I hope you will con- 
tinue to have more like this as well as all 
the good information and routines in your 
regular column by Mr. Pohlman.

Low Riding a High Horse 

While I'm sure that neither you nor Mr. 
Brown wants an argument within the 
pages of Softalk, I cannot resist the im- 
pulse to comment on his letter in the 
April issue. 

I will be brief. First, it seems likely to 
me, although I do not know it for a fact 
that the expenses and markups affecting 
the price of software are not entirely dis- 
similar from those in the book publishing 
industry. Certainly the author of a book 
spends an equal if not greater period in 
laboring over the work. Yet book prices 
are generally five or ten dollars less than 
the prices charged for entertainment 
software. Nor does the author feel en- 
titled in suing the purchaser who loans 
his book to a friend. 

Mr. Brown also seems to be saying 
that the motive impelling software au- 
thors is not the hope of profit, but pride in 
seeing their efforts used and enjoyed. 
While I've no doubt that this is true in Mr. 
Brown's case, I very greatly doubt that it 
is typical. It seems to me in fact that the 
very nature of the microcomputer mar- 
ket at present is one which would tend to 
encourage entrepreneurism and the 
hunger to make a quick buck. The fact 
that there is so little shoddy product and 
dishonest dealing in this market is a trib- 
ute to those in business in it. Not that it is, 
any more than anyone, lily-white. Much 
of the game market is filled with prod- 
ucts which, if not shoddy, are imitative, 



basically unimaginative and which do 
nothing to further the cause, if I can call 
it that, of personal computing. 
Bob Crafts, Edgartown, MA 

Advancing in Pascal 

To Jim Merritt: Thank you for yoxir 
many fine articles on Apple Pascal. They 
are consistently interesting and helpful. 

Could you suggest references to help 
understand the Apple Pascal Operating 
System? I am moving out of the begin- 
ners' ranks and would like to understand 
and explore the Pascal features more 
thoroughly than they are explained in the 
manuals. Examples of things which are 
not explained well include the (*$U-*) 
option; what protocols should be ob- 
served in pushing and pulling param- 
eters on/off the stack in external assem- 
bly language routines ; how can the filer 
be dated directly (i.e., during SYSTEM 
STARTUP). I would value your sugges- 
tions for helpful reading. Thanks again 
for your interesting articles in Softalk. 
John P. Stokes, Kettering, OH 



Teacher's Pet? 

To Roger Wagner: I read and study your 
articles in each issue of Softalk and I at- 
tribute my meager knowledge of assem- 
bly language programming to you and 
Assembly Lines. Your descriptions of the 
different commands plus the many ex- 
amples are superinstructive. I've even 



gone off and written (with much pride) a 
couple of my own programs. This is quite 
an achievement for me and you should 
consider it a gold star for yourself. 

In addition to the ten thousand ar- 
ticles you have lined up to make me even 
smarter, please consider presenting a 
couple on how to structure a program be- 
fore beginning to write the code. What 
should be a JMP, what should be a JSR? 
How do you set up your EQU table at the 
start? Since these questions apply to 
other than assembly language, if there 
already exist some good articles that con- 
tain the answer could you please refer 
your readers to them?

ords. Data are entered into an index 
file for each database that is estab- 
lished. A header file contains the labels 
for the various categories of each data- 
base. The system is useful, but on a num- 
ber of occasions I have been deeply dis- 
tressed to have the data from one of the 
index files unaccountably replaced on the 
disk by headings. This has resulted, of 
course, in irretrievable loss of data. 
Fortunately, even though this bug is very 
sporadic in its occurrence, I have been 
able to find its source and to design a 
very simple fix. 

In writing to the disk (steps 4280-4430 
in my version of the program) a flag reg- 
ister, FF, is set with the statement : IF F$ 
<> "INDEX" then FF=1. If FF has a 
value of 1 then the contents of the R(*) 
array containing the headings are writ- 
ten to the disk. Under ordinary circum- 
stances FF has a value of 0 and then the 
N$(J,I) array is written to the disk. The 
difficulty apparently arises when the pro- 
gram tries to write the index to the disk, 
so that F$= "INDEX" but FF already is 
equal to 1. The conditional statement is 
not executed, but since FF=1 the R$(*) 



array is written to the disk. Although the 
FF register is set to 0 when exiting from 
the subroutines which write to or read 
from the disk, this may fail to occur if an 
exit from one of these subroutines occurs 
through execution of one of the many 
onerrgoto routines with which this pro- 
gram is replete. The difficulty is easily 
overcome by inserting the statement 
FF=0 just before IF F$ <> "INDEX" 
then FF=1 on line 4290, and, to avoid a 
possible problem in reading files, on line 
4120 (in my version of the program). 

Since making these minor alterations 
I have not encountered this difficulty 
with my program, and feel that my data 
files are much more secure. I hope others 
find this change to be useful.

New Info on Old Subject 

First, I'd like to say your magazine is en- 
joyed and used a lot in this household 
both by me and my 14V2-year-old son, 
who is the real programmer in the fami- 
ly. These are my responses to some Open 
Discussion letters. 

1. I agree with M. Lee and C. Graham 
about Apple's new policy. Not every one 
has a good dealer with good support near- 
by. I do, namely Computer Forum in 
Santa Fe Springs, CA. I also have dealt 
with Huntington Computing in Corcoran, 



CA, and they were most helpful when I' 
had a problem. If Apple had dealers ev- 
erywhere I could understand their pol- 
icy. Can Apple dealers mail order? 

2. George Anderson's letter illus- } 
trates the need for making backup 
copies. If he could and didn't he lost a 
program unnecessarily. In this regard I 
applaud Penguin! 

3. I agree with D. Doumakes and ob- j 
ject to sexist ads. 

4. In answer to R. Arnold's letter, I i 
stated in the letter you printed of mine 
that the list of entry addresses I sent had I 
not been tested and might be inaccurate. 
I didn't have the Apple Orchard article 
then. I now have a copy and I know 
Crossley's addresses are more accurate, 
so use them, Mr. Arnold. One of your 
readers contacted me with information 
and I am grateful your readers some- 
times answer and share their knowl- 
edge. (Even Crossley states, "This list ia 
believed to be correct, but be warned that 
it was a spare time project.") Concrete 
examples of how to use these routines are 
discussed in "Apple Machine Lan- 
guage'' by Inman and Inman (for in- 
stance, page 73 shows how to plot a point 
on a screen) . Closer at hand, Mr. Arnold 
should read Assembly Lines by Roger 
Wagner (the early articles are in book 
form if he doesn't have all the back is- 
sues of Softalk) but, more important, he 
should look at pages 155-158 of the March 
issue in which his letter appeared and 
also part 17 in the February issue, which 
might answer his question about basic in- 
formative examples of the uses of sub- 
routines.

An Army Travels on Its Software 

I had expected you to start charging for 
your excellent magazine sooner. I'm 
happy to send a check because you give 
value for your efforts. I'm sorry that your 
staff is underpaid ; as a member of the 
Armed Services I can appreciate the 
thankless position. 

I'd like to thank Mark Pelczarski of 
Pengtiin Software for his making modifi- 
able programs available. I enjoyed his 
tenure with Softside and his programs 
with Co-Op. Though I usually set about to 
break uncopiable programs, it is with the 
intent to personalize them. No, I won't 
rip-off the efforts of authors considerate 
enough of my integrity and abilities to 
leave their wares unprotected. I do re- 
serve the right to modify and improve the 
product for my personal use. And, if a 
dealer will give me a discount, I'll ex- 
ploit that avenue, too. If ever I should im- 
prove a product sufficiently that I feel 
others would benefit, then I'll inform the 
author of my changes. Perhaps we could 
work something out? 

I'd like to condemn the Goldcoast 
Computer Club which is based in Florida 
now. It used to be in Kentucky. They 
have dealt unfairly with me and have 
failed to answer my letters or even

acknowledge that I've sent them. I even 
sent them certified mail with no re-

my frustrating experiences. They owe 
me a good sum of money and when I re- 
turn to the states I'll seek legal redress. 

Your magazine merits all the kudos 
lauded upon it. I'd like to see a column 
dealing with hi-res graphics routines if

Gender Bender 

As my husband and I were reading the 
latest issue of Softalk, we came across 
the letter from the Media Associates 
group which we both found very offen- 
sive. Since I am a woman (not just a 
"person"), and am very proud of my fe- 
male status, I was moved to write this in 
rebuttal, something I have never done 
before. 

May I first say that we have been the 
recipients of your fine publication now 
for several months, and believe it to be 
the finest of its kind. I feel that the writer 
of the above letter expressed a very nar- 



row-minded viewpoint in "its" ex- 
tremely undeserved remarks towards 
your publication (no gender used, since 
apparently the writer wants to be neither 
male nor female) ! 

In reference to the remarks about ads 
utilizing women, I would assume that 
those women who appear in magazine 
ads have been paid for their participa- 
tion in the ads, or the picture would not 
have been printed. Therefore', one could 
not say they have been exploited. Also, 
many magazine ads use a man "as an en- 
ticement to sell a product totally unre- 
lated to his presence." So why not a 
woman? 

As to the Howard Software Services 
ad, I agree that there is no connection be- 
tween the photo and the product, but I do 
not feel that it is sexist or degrading since 
obviously the model was paid for her par- 
ticipation. 

In answer to "its" last comment, 
please do not assume all women want to 
be down at "its" level, (with no identity 
of gender) . Some of us are proud to be 
feminine !

Goodness Has Nothing To Do with It 

It is rare indeed that I take the time to 
write to magazines, but the current com- 
plaints concerning the pornographic na- 
ture of Softalk seem to me to be about the 
dumbest things I have seen in print in a 
long while. How an advertisement show- 
ing three ladies, up to their clavicles in 



water, can be construed as to be so erotic 
that it can be called pornography is diffi- 
cult to understand. The word "porn" that 
appears in the title of the program also 
hardly seems to me to be shocking. Also 
the ads for The Dirty Book and Street 
Life do not cause me to recoil in horror. 
W^at do they think of such words as thief, 
avenger, raider, and invader in program 
titles? Do they protest adventure game 
commands such as kill, hit, shoot, stab, 
destroy? If the puritans are so con- 
cerned about what appears in a maga- 
zine ad, I suggest they sell their Apples 
and use the money to hire private tutors 
for their children lest they be exposed to 
dirty words and ideas at school as they 
most surely will by the time they reach 
junior high. 

The biggest laugher was a hot letter 
from a man protesting the adverse influ- 
ence Softalk's "pornography" was hav- 
ing on his teenager. His address was 
listed as New York City. Goodness, what 
is this man going to do, chain the kid to 
the door of the apartment? He had best 
devise some form of restraint or the 
youngster may break away and wander 
into Times Square. 
Tom Hunt, Kansas City, MO 

I agree with G. Anderson's letter about 
software problems. One of the worst for 
me is a program that after completion 
leaves the computer hanging and it will 
not even accept a reset. 

Then there is Don Doumakes. Sexist 
views are taught in the home, and in 
school, not in magazine ads. I guess no 
products should be promoted with real 
people, maybe we could use dummies. 
Don made no mention of the Corona ad in 
page 5 (March) . Are they trying to say 
that only men work computers and wear 
business suits? On page 54, is Sirius say- 
ing that only men are bad guys? Why not 
quit trying to read between the lines, and 
accept ads for what they are — ads. If you 
look for trouble, you will find it. I do not 
see sexism, I see pictures of people and 
never stop to worry about suits, aprons, 
or hardhats. 

Darrell Hunsaker reminds me of a lot 
of people on welfare or the food stamp 
program. They soon forget that it is not a 
constitutional right, nor a God-given 
right. It is a handout, something free to 
the recipient. They also forget that noth- 
ing is completely free, somebody pays 
for it, and I will gladly pay for Softalk. 
Evaluation and backup of all advertised 
items hardly deserves an answer. If I 
want Consumer Reports, I will go buy 
one. I feel sorry for any sailing or auto- 
motive magazine that Darrell buys if he 
wants evaluation and backup from them 
too. The best you can do is deal with a 
good computer store who lets you try out 
software before you take it home. Let's 
come down on the software companies 
who don't back up their products, and 
leave Softalk alone.

THE SPOKEN WORD" 




Man's Most Powerful Means 
of Communication 
Comes to Your Computer 



Until recently, talking computers existed only in the 
fantasy of science fiction, or at a great cost in industrial 
and university laboratories. Since then, speech units 
have appeared commercially in the $250 to $350 price 
range, but with little sophistication and potentially low 
speech quality. Voice Tech Industries has a unique new 
manual for the Apple and TRS80* personal computers. 
Utilizing our methods and commercially available com- 
ponents, your personal computer can actually speak. 
This product is unique in several ways. Our technology 
is the newest in the industry, the speech quality is su- 
perb, and you can build it yourself for under $50.00. 

The Voice Tech 30 page manual is both educational 
and informative. It describes how complex speech wave- 
forms are produced from the human vocal cavity and 
how these wave forms are electronically modeled. You 
will learn how advances in LSI semiconductor technol- 
ogy have enabled designers to put a digital model of the 
human vocal tract, a controller, and speech data on 
silicon. Complete, detailed instructions on interfacing 
speech hardware to the Apple and TRS 80* computers 
are given. (The manual contains a coupon through 
which you can order the hardware components speci- 
fied at a 50% discount). Also, professionally written 
software examples are provided that illustrate the fun- 
damental principles and techniques. 

Because speech is truly synthesized, the vocabulary 
is actually limitless. A common software interface can 
be shared among many different applications. Business 
reports can now be delivered verbally, educational pro- 
grams can communicate via sight and sound, message 
centers can audibly report, and the potential for game 
applications is boundless. 

Voice Tech has been in the speech synthesis field 



since its inception. Because of our unique background, 
we have produced a clear, concise, and interesting doc- 
ument that we are now making available to the personal 
computer market. After reading the manual, the hard- 
ware can be added to your system as easily as any other 
standard peripheral. Voice Tech stresses that all prod- 
ucts offered carry a full money-back guarantee. 

To order, just fill out the coupon below and send it

'VAboiit 



At the end of last month we started using one of the most 
powerful commands in Applesoft, the /or . . . next loop. Since 
we have also had a rather fleeting exposure to some other po- 
tent commands, this month we're going to eschew new vocab- 
ulary in favor of exploring more thoroughly what we already 
know. After all, you didn't learn English by trying each word 
just once either. 

Let's begin by looking at the for . . . next loop again. As a 
limbering up exercise, let's try to develop an easy way to draw 
a line of equals signs all the way across the screen. Of course, 
we could be very simple-minded and do it like this: 



lyDoBgCarist] 



10 PRINT" 



This is popularly known as the brute force method and wins no 
kudos for grace or style. Instead, let's try to come up with a 
technique that uses a loop. In fact, why don't you go ahead and 
do it yourself before continuing — after all, what's the point in 
owning an Apple if you're going to spend all day sitting around 
reading magazines? 

We've got two different kinds of loops available to us now. 
Traditionalists will prefer: 

10 PRINT"=";: X = X + 1: IF X < 40 THEN 10 

However, the for . . . next loop is equally effective : 

10 FOR X = 1 TO 40: PRINT " = ";: NEXT X 

If you find that really exciting, you might want to fill the en- 
tire screen with equals signs. Since there are twenty- four lines, 
with forty characters in each line, we could get this effect by 
changing the 40 in line 10 to 40 x 24 (anybody have a calcula- 
tor?) , but if we wanted to leave line 10 strictly alone, we could 
get the same effect by looping through it twenty-four times: 

5 FOR Y = 1 TO 24 

10 FOR X = 1 TO 40; PRINT "=";: NEXT X 
20 NEXT Y 

These are called nested loops, which has a nice domestic 
ring to it. The X loop is wholly contained within the Y loop. You 
can nest as many loops within one another as you like within 
reason (moderation is the key word) . Good loops will look like 
this: 

FOR X . . . 
FOR Y . . . 

FOR Z . . . 

NEXT Z 
NEXT Y 

FOR A . . . , 
NEXT A 
NEXT X 

Get the picture? Always avoid crossed loops. Think of it this 
way. Imagine that you have a sink full of dishes, each labeled 
with a letter of the alphabet. Each time you come to a. for . . . 
statement, you will pull out the appropriately labeled dish and 
place it in a stack. Then, when you come to a next statement, 
you will want to take a plate off this stack. If you write your 
code properly, when you come to a next X statement, the top 
plate left on the stack will be the one marked with the X. There 



are rumors that the inventor of the for . . . next loop was once 
a busboy in the undergraduate cafeteria at Dartmouth, which 
may explain how this particular concept leaked into current 
computer lore. 

Let's try one more example that uses nested loops and also 
resurrects the subroutine: 

5 HOME: GOTO 100 

10 FOR X = 1 TO 40: PRINT" =";: NEXT X 

15 RETURN 

20 FOR Z = 1 TO 3 

25 FOR A = 1 TO 6 

30 PRINT "I "; 

35 NEXT A: PRINT "I" 

40 NEXT Z: RETURN 

99 REM ***** MAIN PROGRAM ***** 

100 FOR Y = 1 TO 5 

110 GOSUB 10: GOSUB 20 
120 NEXT Y 
130 GOSUB 10 
140 GOTO 140 

Here's an example of triply nested loops. The A is inside the Z, 
and the Z is inside the Y. Run the program. Now you can fill the 
screen with lots of little boxes, which has to be good for some- 
thing. 

Before we move on, one caveat. Don't ever leave a 
for . . . next loop other than by the exit. Here's an example of 
terrible code that does just that: 

10 FOR X = 1 TO 10 
20 GOTO 50 
30 NEXT X 
50 .... 

The same stricture applies to subroutines. Incidentally. Sneak- 
ing off into the code without exiting via the return statement 
leaves unwashed dishes on the stack. Try the following pro- 
gram if you want to see what happens if you violate this rule to 
an immoderate extent: 



10 
20 



GOSUB 20 
GOSUB 10 



Let's move on to more esoteric matters now, specifically 
two commands that complement one another, however little 
we may think of them. They are ASC(/i) and CHR$(n) . As you 
may recall, the Apple thinks only in numbers and will convert 
any alphabetic information you may give it into a number be- 
fore processing. For example, the letter A is changed into the 
number 65 by your computer — Z becomes 90. These numbers, 
called ASCII codes, can be used in the CHR$(n) command to 
generate any character in the Apple's repertoire (which ac- 
tually contains a few characters that aren't even found on the 
keyboard) . 

To see the full range of characters available to your Apple, 
enter the following line in immediate mode: 

FOR X = 1 TO 128: PRINT CHR$(X): NEXT X 

You knew those for . . . next loops had to be good for some- 
thing, didn't you? With any luck at all, you heard a beep and 



JUNE 1982 



37 



then the Apple character set appeared. The beep, in case 
you're curious was CHR$(7) being printed. That's the same as 
control-G, which is marked on the keyboard as "bell." The 
first thirty-two characters in the character set are control 
characters and are invisible (and mostly inaudible too). 

If you would like to know what number to use in the 
CHR^(n) command to create a particular character, you can 
use ASC(n) to find out. Type in the following short program 
(after new) : 

10 GET A$: PRINT AS," ";ASC(A$): GOTO 10 

When you run this, you can read the ASCII value of all the 
keys. Even keys like return and the arrow keys have ASCII 
values. The escape key is the same as CHR$(27). You may no- 
tice that control-H is the same as the left arrow and that con- 
trol-M is the same as return. In fact, if you try to use the con- 
trol keys in place of left arrow and return, you will find that 
they work perfectly well (the next time we write an Applesoft 
program, try ending each line with a control-M). 

The ability to convert characters to a numerical format can 
be very valuable, since the Apple is mostly a number crunch- 
er, and there are many occasions when it can perform its tasks 
more easily if you speak to it in its own language. Perhaps an 
example is in order. Type new and try this: 

5 FOR X = 5000 TO 5026: POKE X,0: NEXT X 

10 HOME: PRINT "TYPE IN A SENTENCE" 
20 PRINT "AND PRESS (a WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED . . ." 

30 GET A$: IF A$ <> "(5" THEN PRINT A$; 

40 A = ASC(A$) - 64 

50 POKE 5000 + A, PEEK (5000 + A) + 1 

60 IF A$ <> "(a" THEN 30 

70 PRINT: PRINT: FOR X = 1 TO 26 

80 PRINT CHR$(X + 64);" ";PEEK(5000 + X), 

90 NEXT X 



All this little program will do is give you a count of the num- 
ber of times each letter of the alphabet appeared in whatever 
you typed. Let's look at how it works. 

Line 5 will clear a little area of the Apple's RAM to zero. 
The area chosen (5000 to 5026) is, if you remember your mem- 
ory map, somewhere in the region where the Apple stores Ap- 
plesoft programs. Since it starts storing programs at 2048 and 
since our program is pretty short, 5000 seems a good bet to be 
free (if we were wrong, we would certainly find out very 
quickly) . 

Lines 10 and 20 put the instructions on the screen. The in- 
teresting part is the loop from lines 30 to 60. Line 30 grabs the 
first character you type, stores it in the variable A$, and prints 
it to the screen unless it is a @ (the < > symbol stands for 
"not equal to") . 

Line 40 then sets the numerical variable A equal to the 
ASCII value of A$ less 64. Why? Well, hark back to the ASCII 
character set that we printed on the screen not too long ago. 
Then hark right on back here and consider that, since the 
ASCII value of the letter A is 65, line 40 would take 65 and sub- 
tract 64 from it if you typed the letter A, leaving a value of 1 
(and 2 for B and so forth) . The variable A (not to be confused 
with the letter A which we may or may not have Just typed on 
the keyboard) is set equal to this value. 

Line 50 is a single command, a, poke command. First, it fig- 
ures out which byte in memory to poke by adding A to 5000. If 
we just typed the letter Z, then A is equal to 26 and so we are 
going to poke address 5026 in RAM. Next, the poke command 
figures out what number to poke into this address (the comma 
separates the two parts of the poke command) . As you can see, 
first the Apple peeks into location 5026 to see what's already 
there (there should be a zero to start out, thanks to line 5). 
Then it adds one to this number and pokes it back into the same 
location. 

In this way we set up twenty-six separate counters in mem- 
ory to keep track of each of the twenty-six different letters of 
the alphabet. Line 60 keeps us looping back to get another char- 
acter until the @, sign gets pressed. When we're all done, the 



for . . . next loop in lines 70 and 80 will print a little table show- 
ing the frequency with which we used each of the letters of the 
alphabet. Line 80 uses the CHR$Cn^ command to print each let- 
ter of the alphabet, followed by the number peeked out of the 
appropriate location. 

Peeking and poking can be quite dangerous, especially if 
you start poking into areas you know little about. As a little ex- 
periment, try poking a few random numbers into the address- 
es between 2048 and, say, 2100. Then try to list your program. 
Hope you saved it first. 

A far safer way to store this table of information would be in 
an array. We used an array briefly when we were designing 
our word processor. Any array with more than ten elements 
has to be predefined early in your program, however, so the 
Apple can set adequate space aside to handle it. Therefore, we 
start the program off with a dimension statement that re- 
serves adequate space for our variables: 



5 DIM ARRAY(26) 

50 ARRAY(A) = ARRAY(A) +1 

80 PRINT CHR$(X + 64)," 



';ARRAY(X) 



There ! With those three changes we have set up an array that 
keeps all of our values intact. We don't need to fear the conse- 
quences if our program gets too large. There is another ad- 
vantage, too. A byte of memory can only store values up to 255. 
This array can handle numbers of any size. Of course, we had 
to sneak a new vocabulary word in, but that's a small price to 
pay. 

CHR^(n) has many uses. One of the most valuable is to in- 
sert control characters into your program. You can enter con- 
trol characters directly, of course. Try new and then type this :

EZ-LEDGER 

EZ-LEDGER is the ideal record keeping system for somebody run- 
ning a small business out of their home or the self-employed profes- 
sional, EZ-LEDGER uses the simpleist form of bookkeeping 
possible. Single entry bookkeeping requires only posting transac- 
tions either under INCOME or EXPENSE. 

EZ-LEDGER will keep track of expense items under any one of 99 
user selected tax codes plus keeping all year-to-date and monthly 
running totals for each of the selected items. Expense items may be 
entered under DEDUCTIBLE or NON-DEDUCTIBLE type codes, 
EZ-LEDGER is a strictly cash system, i.e. if you pay out monies 
(check, cash, credit cards etc.) then the transaction is posted under 
EXPENSE and it you receive monies then record them under 
INCOME. 

EZ-LEDGER will produce INVOICES with an automatically incre- 
mented invoice number and then automatically post the data to an 
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 'holding' file or directly to INCOME and 
update all totals. 

The accounts receivable and accounts payable files are holding' 
files with their own running year to date totals. Transactions in these 
files may be automatically posted to INCOME or EXPENSE and all 
respective totals will be updated automatically. 
EZ-LEDGER will support 80 or 132 column printers and one or two 
disk drives. The printer is needed for producing invoices, but option- 
al on all other reports.

10 PRINT "" [hit control-G about ten times between the quotes] 

When you nm this, the Apple bell routine will sound ten times. 
In fact, if you want to make an unholy nuisance of yourself, you 
can add a goto 10 command right afterward and probably 
drive your entire family out of doors. However, if you try to 
edit line 10 by copying it over with the right arrow, the control 
keys will disappear. And if you try to read your listing five 
years from now, it may not be entirely clear that was sup- 
posed to be between the quotes either. 
Here's another way to handle it: 

10 A$ = CHR${7): FOR X = 1 TO 10: PRINT A$;: NEXT X 

There's another use important to those of you who have 
disk drives. DOS commands like catalog are usually typed di- 
rectly without line numbers. Since DOS checks whatever you 
type before the Applesoft interpreter can get its hands on it, 
you don't ordinarily have to worry about what Applesoft thinks 
of a DOS command. What if you want to use a DOS command 
in your Applesoft program, though? There has to be some way 
to warn DOS to pay attention to what's going on. 

The way this is handled is by having the Applesoft pro- 
gram print the DOS command preceded by a control-D which 
warns DOS that this isn't a normal prin^ statement coming up. 
Look at this example: 

10 PRINT"THE PROGRAMS ON THIS DISK ARE:" 
20 A$ = CHR$(4): PRINT A$;"CATALOG" 

CHR$C-4j is the same as control-D, of course. We could have 
typed an invisible control-D before the C in catalog, which 
would have worked just as well, but if we had ever edited the 
line, the control-D would have disappeared, in which case line 
20 would have printed the word catalog on the screen instead of 
doing a catalog of the disk. 

Another use of the CHR^(n) commands comes into play if 
you have a printer. Type in the following: 



FOR X = 1 TO 128: PRINT CHR$(X); : NEXT X 

You should see a lot of punctuation, then the entire alphabet, 
then more punctuation. Now try a little experiment. Using the 
edit keys, move the cursor up to the beginning of the character 
set and then pass over the set with the right arrow. 

What happened to all that punctuation at the end of the 
character set? The truth of the matter is that that wasn't punc- 
tuation at all ; that was Applesoft's effort to print lowercase let- 
ters. Only since the Apple's character generator doesn't have 
lower-case letters, all that came out was garbage. And when 
you edited over these characters, your obliging Apple convert- 
ed them into upper-case letters so you could read them. 

If you wanted to use your printer to print letters, you might 
want to use lower-case as well as upper-case. Here's an exam- 
ple showing how you might handle that: 

10 PR#1 [used to direct output to o printer in slot 1] 
20 GET A$: X = ASC (A$) 

30 IF X > 64 AND X < 91 THEN X = X + 32 [if A$ is a capital letter, then con- 
vert it to lower-case] 

40 IF A$ = "@" THEN FLAG = 1 : GOTO 20 (if A$ is @, it means that we want 
the following letter to be upper case) 

50 IF FLAG = 1 THEN X = X - 32: FLAG = 0 (convert the letter back to upper- 
case and reset the flog) 

60 PRINT CHR$(X);: GOTO 20 

By adding thirty-two to the ASCII value of whatever letter we 
type, we get the lower-case equivalent of the same letter. 

Incidentally, if you don't have a printer, just delete line 10 
and run the program anyway. Lines of garbage will appear on 
the screen as you type, but if you interrupt the program by 
pressing reset (remembering that control-C doesn't work 
when you are using the get$ command) and then edit over the 
garbage, your actual meaning will appear like magic. 

Well, we didn't get very far along on our word processor 
this time, but we should make some progress on it next month. 
Promises, promises. Hi

PUT YOUR APPLE TO WORK FOR YOU! 

WITH THE THUNDERCLOCK PLUS™ 

As an APPLE user you already know all the things your APPLE can do. Now Thunderware 
expands that list with the THUNDERCLOCK PLUS, the complete clock/calendar system 
for your APPLE! Your programs can read the month, date, day-of-week, hour, 
minute, and second in any of APPLE'S languages. On-board batteries keep 
your THUNDERCLOCK running accurately when your APPLE is off - for up 
to 4 years before battery replacement. But that's just the beginning. 

The THUNDERCLOCK PLUS is the most useful and versatile peripheral 
you can put in your APPLE. It can keep your disk files organized by 
time-and-date-stamping them, it enhances the usability of many of the 
new business/professional software packages for accounting, filing, and 
time management, and it can remotely control lights and appliances 
for security or display purposes in your business or home. 

SOFTWARE PRODUCT COMPATIBILITY 

Many of today's important software packages for data-base 
management, business applications, communications, and time management are designed to use the 
THUNDERCLOCK PLUS. If you have or plan to purchase any of these packages, a THUNDERCLOCK will greatly

In this installment of Buttonwood Apples, we'll discuss a 
family of programs known as decision generators. 

A decision generator is a program that performs calcula- 
tions on input data — such as stock price highs, lows, closes, and 
stock volume — and provides recommendation as to whether 
the security in question should be bought, sold, or held. 

The results of the analysis done by these programs may be 
depicted graphically or may be presented in a report that indi- 
cates the strategy to be followed. 

Most of these packages have a facility that allows them to 
make use of such electronic databases as Dow Jones, the 
Source, or Compuserve for their input data. Since most pro- 
grams of this class rely on technical analysis techniques for

their decision criteria, it's important that investors under- 
stand the theoretical foundations of technical analysis. 

One of the dominant themes in financial and academic 
literature since the 1960s has been the concept that capital 
markets are efficient. Efficiency in this sense means that 
security prices reflect all available information. There have 
been numerous studies of the efficient market hypothesis. The 
results have varied, but all seem to show strong evidence that 
past price information and public information are quickly in- 
corporated into security prices. 

The traditional argument against technical analysis is that 
if all past information has been incorporated into the price of 
the security, then analysis of the data will not yield any indica- 
tions of future performance. 

A technician would argue that if all past information were 
reflected in the price of the security, then analysis of the data 
would reveal the security's response to varying market condi- 
tions and events. Technical analysis will also highlight move- 
ments that may otherwise be ambiguous. The patterns dis- 
tilled from the data identify movement or actions in the mar- 
ket we might not be aware of otherwise. 

Now that we have established the theoretical framework 
for examining decision generators, let's look at this class of 
software en masse, rather than at specific packages. 

If you have ever looked at a chart of past security prices or 
at a market index, a pattern must have become apparent to 
you. Perhaps prices appeared to have increased every fourth 
week in each third month on the second Monday. Presto! A 
decision rule is born! It's possible that you noticed that securi- 
ty prices increase every fourth month of the second year from 
the start of the cycle ; here again, you created a decision rule 
based on a perceived pattern. 

There was a famous decision rule that related the behavior 
of the market to the length of women's skirts; as skirts rose, it 
was reasoned, so would the market! In essence, the human 
mind looks for order and, in the absence of order, creates 
order. 

The decision generators presently marketed for the Apple 
are normally based on technical analysis of price and volume 
information. Some authors of these packages refuse to discuss 
the analytic technique they've incorporated in the software. 

There are problems inherent in this type of software and in 
the attitude just mentioned. If the author refuses to discuss or 
publish the technique being used in the package, how can the 
investor have faith in the recommendations generated by the 
package? The package may perform well under a specific set 
of market conditions and then cause disastrous results when 
these certain specifications are not met. 

When students in a graduate business school were given a 
series of pure random numbers and told that these numbers

represented relative price movements of securities, they be- 
gan to formulate decision rules based on the patterns they per- 
ceived in the data, even though, by definition, no pattern exists 
in a random number series. If the authors of decision genera- 
tors begin to see patterns that are illusionary but base their 
packages on these rules, what's to become of the capital of the 
investor who follows the recommendations of the package? In 
all probability his money will also become illusionary. 

The second problem with this genre of program is how to 
evaluate it. If the execution of the package is poor, but you can 
earn a profit using it, at what point does the inconvenience of 
running a poorly executed package outweigh the financial re- 
wards of using it? This decision is a highly subjective judg- 
ment, one that should be left to the individual investor. 

Rather than convey to you the results we have obtained 
from using and testing these packages, here's a set of criteria 
investors should use in determining which packages to pur- 
chase for their particular applications. 

Ask the publisher or your dealer to supply you with the 
hardware specifications of the package. Does it use a modem? 
If so, which type of modem does it require? How many disk 
drives are required? Is a printer a necessity? 

Once you have determined if the software is compatible 
with your system, you're ready to evaluate the package's 
value to you in carrying out your investment objectives. 

Ask the dealer or manufacturer to supply you with any de- 
scriptive literature on the software. What is its track record? 
In what types of markets has it performed best? What are the 
credentials of its authors? Request to be referred to investors 
who have used the program. Contact these people and get their 
impressions of the software's reliability, execution, and per- 
formance. 

If after gathering this information you are satisfied that the 
program may benefit you, call the authors of the program. Ask 
them what type of support they will give you when you pur- 
chase the program. Will they be available for telephone con- 



sultations and, if so, on what basis? What about disk back-up 
policy or, in the case of a hardware protection key, what is the 
replacement policy? 

You should also ask what analysis technique is being used 
by the program. Make it clear to the person to whom you're 
speaking that you won't consider purchasing a program of this 
nature without being aware of the analysis technique em- 
ployed. Don't settle for esoteric, cloudy answers. It's your right 
as a purchaser to know what you're buying. If the authors are 
unwilling to supply you with this information, then you should 
be suspicious. Buying a protected program in which you can 
not examine the algorithm to determine what analysis is tak- 
ing place is analogous to purchasing a used car when the own- 
er will not allow you to test-drive it. 

If you do decide to purchase the software, press for a mon- 
ey-back guarantee for a period of thirty to sixty days. This 
may seem an unreasonable request, but when the consumer 
purchases a piece of investment software that promises to 
deliver profitable investment decisions, the publisher should 
warranty the product to that effect. This is not to say that if you 
lose money in the short run when using a package you should 
return it and demand your money back. But if the package 
does not meet the specifications set forth by the manufacturer 
for reliability and profit performance, and is not supported as 
promised, the investor should have the remedy of returning 
the product for a full refund. 

Decision generator software differs from other types of 
software for microcomputers; users not only invest their mon- 
ey in the software but, by following its recommendations, 
they risk more money. In essence, we are describing an auto- 
mated securities analyst/advisor. Human securities 
analysts/advisors are registered and disciplined by the Securi- 
ties and Exchange Commission, the various exchanges, and 
trade associations, but there is no agency charged to protect 
the public interest concerning decision generator software. In 
essence, caveat emptor, let the buyer beware.

Interactive 
Structures 

On the 
SC Pulse 
^ of the 

Future 

Bv iin SAmons 

Perhaps what is most remarkable about Interactive Struc- 
tures is what is unremarkable. This is not the tale of a compa- 
ny that has a tiger by the tail. Its corporate goals are not the 
lofty rhetoric of an entrepreneurial egomaniac who sees the fu- 
ture of microcomputing and envisions himself at the indus- 
try's top. Its strategies have not demanded meteoric growth, 
which too often mask inadequacies of the business plan and 
management team. In what it is not is a lesson to be learned 
for all who may be considering the start of their own high-tech 
companies or who are considering what to look for in the com- 
pany behind the products they plan to purchase. 

"In what it is not, it is" is an interesting linguistic convolu- 
tion relevant to the Interactive Structures story. Interactive 
Structures designs, produces, and markets interfaces. Con- 
sidering the word interface crept into the language barely one 
hundred years ago to describe "a surface lying between two 
portions of matter or space, and forming their common bound- 
ary" {Oxford English Dictionary), it is certainly remarkable 
that anyone can make a living selling them. 



A Dozen Donut Holes, Please. As a scientific term, inter- 
face was a noun describing something that wasn't, a basic con- 
ception within the body of knowledge which has come to be 
known as General System Theory, a way of thinking that helps 
our understanding of the interrelations of one thing with an- 
other. As our conceptualizing became more formalized and 
complex reflecting the reality of complexity in real-world sys- 
tems, elementary ideas were enhanced by our expanded un- 
derstanding. An interface was not simply a theoretical com- 
mon boundary, but a vital linkage in the process of transaction 
between two discrete systems or organizational structures. 

Herein lies the conceptual pun of Interactive Structures 's 
corporate name. "It is what it isn't." By implication, the struc- 
tures interact by theoretical necessity through their interface. 
And because a system, which is an information storehoiise, 
can become more organized, and by understanding the func- 
tions of its boundaries incorporate them into a new, larger, 
more inclusive system, the systemic territory of the interface 
is elusive. By its corporate name. Interactive Structures has 
demonstrated its recognition of the elusive nature of the realm 
within which it does business. This understanding is funda- 
mental to the business strategy that will increase its chances of 
survival and growth into a long-term successful company. 

In the microcomputer peripheral products industry, which 
includes interfaces as well as the multitude of add-on special 
purpose expansion boards and hardware devices, today's 
product can become a standard feature of tomorrow's version 
of the system the product enhances. Certainly the market for 
eighty-column cards will suffer slower growth due to this fea- 
ture's inclusion as standard on many of the newly introduced 
microcomputers. Some flash-in-the-pan peripheral products 
manufacturers find they have merely polished the rough edges 
of a product until the original manufacturer has the time and 
resources to tidy up its own house ; the proverbial castle in the 
sand. 

Only Fools Rush In. So what kind of mind would venture In- 
to such an area looking to build a business where solid founda- 
tions are few and far between? To answer, we have to take a 
look at Joe Willson, Ph.D., president of Interactive Structures. 
For, if one thing is certain, the current realization of Interac- 
tive Structures is the result of Willson's creative technical ex- 
pertise and persistent sound business judgement. 

This is not to detract from the contribution made by those 
who work with and for him. Yet the opportunity for these con- 
tributions is again the result of Joe's sound business strategy 
and nurturing management skills, which encourage the reali- 
zation of his partner's and employees' potential. And most cer- 
tainly, the future of the corporation will depend on the growing 
contribution made by these significant others, whose personal 
skills are growing to meet the challenge of the evolution of In- 
teractive Structures into a healthy medium-sized company. 




A color graphics printout using Pkoso. Joe Willson, the man behind Interactive Structures. 



The Darwinian analogy raises the question, "Where did it 
all begin?" 

The Dawn of Time for Willson was 1945 in Texas. At age 
five he left the land of rhinestone cowboys for the land of rhine- 
stone sunglasses: Miami, Florida. As is not uncommon with 
technical whizzes in the micro industry, Willson developed an 
early interest in playing music, the guitar having a special at- 
traction. The possibility of adding electricity to the instru- 
ments to amplify and modify the sounds introduced Willson to 
the endless fascination of electronic sound amplification and 
visual special effects. 

A healthy measure of native intelligence and some well-di- 
rected educational guidance swept Willson from the sun and 
fun capital of the world to the hallowed halls of intellectual in- 
spiration, Princeton University. As is often the case in a good 
liberal arts academic environment, Willson was challenged 
and stimulated by a first-rate faculty while pursuing his un- 
dergraduate degree in electrical engineering. 

Among his inspirational teachers, E. J. McClusky and Ken 
Steiglitz opened the world of logic and systematic thinking to 
Willson. Information, soft structures, met the hard structures 
of electronic systems. Having confronted, understood, and in- 
corporated the relationships between the soft information sys- 
tems existing within the hard systems of the electronic physi- 
cal world, Willson had moved the interface outward between 
what he conceived of as the realm of his professional concern 
and what was none of his business. 

The Bride Came C.O.D. Joe Willson was becoming one of a 
new generation of electrical engineers who are as comfortable 
creating software systems as they are creating the physical 
hardware that brings these soft systems to life. This marriage 
of interest in information and electronic systems inevitably led 
to Willson's introduction to the computer, the ultimate elec- 
tronic information machine. 

Yet his introduction was at arm's length. The Princeton 
computers were noninteractive mainframes which were only 
accessible to electronics students for use in their class assign- 
ments. Willson diligently punched cards and delivered them to 
a work-study student who informed him, "The results of your 
run will be ready Tuesday. Next?" 

Upon his 1967 graduation, seeking a more intense exposure 
to the combined application of electronic and information sys- 
ems, Willson headed straight to graduate school at the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania. He went to the source, the Moore 
School of Electronics, where the first full-scale electronic com- 
puter, the ENIAC, had been built some twenty-two years 
earlier. While soaking up vast amounts of technical knowl- 
edge relevant to his professional training, Willson was again 
allowed to express himself in the areas that had originally at- 
tracted him to electronics as a towheaded beach boy back in 
Miami: music and visual effects, concepts he began profes- 



sionally thinking of as signal generation and image processing. 

Morris Rubinoff , another formative instructor, invited Will- 
son to become involved in an educational film production. 
Choosing no ordinary educational film, Willson's program- 
ming skills were challenged by the objective of using comput- 
er graphics to visualize the propagation of electromagnetic 
waves through space ; electric field begetting orthogonal mag- 
netic field begetting orthogonal electric field out of theoretical 
textbook and into the student's eye. 

He was in electronic computer heaven. During the film 
project and throughout his studies, he was at last within the 
realm, the interface, between hard and soft systems; the realm 
of interactive computers. Willson began hands-on/mind-into 
interaction with accessible computers, Interdata 7/1 6s, 2901 
processors, LSI-lls and a host of mini and emerging micro 
technological componentry. 

And the Bands Drooled On. Bringing a research and teach- 
ing specialization in computer-generated music, the timely ad- 
dition of Steven Smoliar to the university's faculty provided a 
unique opportunity for Joe to combine intimately his long-time 
interest in music with his highly technical studies in electrical 
engineering. The result of Joe's work with Smoliar could make 
the members of the state-of-the-art German micro-assisted 
synthesizer band, Kraftwerk, collectively drool. Joe's music 
system would boggle the minds of the English techno-pop 
punkers. The Human League. 

Joe built a multiprocessor music synthesizer. This unique 
system used a 2901 processor for signal generation to produce 
the sound and an Interdata 716 served as a controUer/manag- 
er, a kind of cybernetic Arthur Fiedler. This two-machine 
"performer and conductor" system provided fertile ground for 
the development of Joe's doctoral dissertation on advanced ap- 
plications in signal processing with a focus on the man-ma- 
chine-machine interfaces. 

With so complex a topic, it took Joe the better part of ten 
years to complete the dissertation that, in 1979, earned him a 
doctorate in electrical engineering. But don't let this ten-year 
time span frighten those of you who might be considering ad- 
vanced studies in electrical engineering, for Willson was busy 
accomplishing many things concurrent with work on his de- 
gree. Aside from his growing involvement in independent con- 
sulting, Willson met, married and started a family with Mi- 
chelle Kindt, a psychiatric nurse destined for a career 
change. 

In April of 1974, Joe and two coUeagiaes from school incor- 
porated as a systems house to give an identity to their consult- 
ing activities. Interactive Structures was bom a think tank and 
would evolve into a manufacturer in an Industry which wasn't 
itself yet bom. Along the way Joe and his original partners 
found exciting opportunities for the release of the creative pro- 
fessional skills. Among the list of impressive projects, mostly

sophisticated business graphics and management information 
systems, one stands out as a singular achievement: Design 
for Fun. 

Booting Up the Stars and Bars. As a part of the bicenten- 
nial celebration, the city of Philadelphia decided to showcase 
the history of American leisure and entertainment activities. 
In addition to displays of how folks have had good times in the 
past and present, Philadelphia wanted to include a specula- 
tive exhibit on good times in the future. In response to a re- 
quest for proposal. Interactive Structures outlined a massive 
undertaking, the creation of a futuristic amusement park — an 
electronic playground. 

It was no contest. Interactive Structures won the contract 
and began an eighteen-month effort in the design and con- 
struction of the exhibit. Though his original partners were still 
intimately involved and contributed significantly to the proj- 
ect, it was the ultimate realization of Willson's lifelong fasci- 
nation with music and visual special effects. 

Since video games were little more than a Pongish gleam in 
Atari's eye, the exhibit featured many large-scale interactive 
displays that dazzled visitors' eyes and ears. It is fascinating to 
think how much different the focus of the exhibit might have 
been had the micro industry started a little sooner or had our 
Founding Fathers taken a bit longer to ratify the Ctonstitution, 
thereby postponing the two hundredth birthday party until af- 
ter the advent of Raster Blaster and Castle Wolfenstein. 

But what Interactive Structures delivered kept Philadel- 
phians fascinated for more than two years, that is, until so 
many visitors had interacted with the displays that they suf- 
fered physical deterioration. An entire generation of Philadel- 
phia schoolchildren will tell their grandchildren, "I saw this 
kind of stuff at the Design for Fun exhibit back in 1976!" 

And what they saw, heard, and touched was a sight and 
sound extravaganza. Imagine thirty first and second graders 
jumping around on a gigantic rubber daisy where each petal 
was connected to an input channel of a computer which fed 
back musical sounds and colorful special lighting effects. 
Imagine a three-thousand-bulb, nine-foot-square panel con- 
nected to a video camera by a computer image digitizer that 
produced full-color images of the visitors in a way they had 
never seen themselves before. Imagine a platform to stand on 
where each visitor was treated to a "reflection" of themselves 
in the format of a colorful laser light display with synthesized 
musical accompaniment, each display unique as a finger- 
print. Imagine a translucent tunnel where each step created a 
light and sound environment that followed the visitor from one 
end to the other. Where we have to imagine these things, Phil- 
adelphlans experienced it. 

Your Horror Show of Shows. Interactive Structures had 
created a cybernetic fun house where visitors' reflections were 
a far cry from traditional warped mirrors. Underpinning 
this dramatic display was a complex system of computers, 
digital-to-analog and analog- to-dlgltal converters, signal gen- 
erators, loudspeakers, video cameras, lasers, switches, and 
miles of wires. It was an "interface nightmare." Not only did 
the visitor /display interface have to be considered, but each 
electronic component had to be interfaced to other com- 
ponents within the entire system. The fact that the exhibit was 
able to remain functional long after the scheduled close was a 
testimony to the quality of the work Interactive Structures had 
done. 

Changes in the professional directions of Willson's original 
partners created a transition period for Interactive Structures 
in 1977. With his original partners gone, Willson began to focus 
his attentions on the emerging generation of microprocessors. 
On a visit to one of the first microcomputer retailers, Willson 
saw his first Apple. 

It was an Apple I and was little more than a box of compo- 
nent parts, as micros were still in the hobbyist kit stage of de- 
velopment. Since no one else knew what to do with it, the re- 
tailer lent the kit to Willson. It was soon together and working. 
Impressed with what he had done, the retailer was happy to 
sell the system to Joe. 



Soon after he completed the Apple I kit, Willson saw an ad- 
vertisement for the Apple II. He couldn't believe what he read. 
Someone was actually thinking ahead and had designed a 
micro with full-scale applications and hardware expansion po- 
tential. The sophistication of the input /output features, the 
memory expansion capability, and the provision of slots for pe- 
ripheral devices created a vision for Willson. Interactive Struc- 
tures would develop and market a full range of Apple periph- 
eral products. 

So, Willson now relates with mixed emotions, he traded in 
his Apple I for a II and began design work in earnest. The re- 
sult is a full range of interface devices that enable scientific 
and industrial applications. 

"I didn't want to try to do everjrthlng at once," Willson ex- 
plained. "Knowing how volatile the peripherals market is, I 
knew it would be difficult to raise the capital to develop and 
distribute products across the full spectrum of the market. So I 
decided to stick to what I knew best." 

Count Pennies, Count Friends. And Willson knows best the 
needs of scientists in academic and Industrial laboratories. 
"With limited department budgets and grant-funding ceil- 
ings, most academic researchers are very cost conscious. The 
same is increasingly true for Industrial researchers who want 
to demonstrate a new idea without having to spend a lot of 
money on equipment," Willson said. "So our strategfy has al- 
ways been modular design; the customers buy what they need. 
Some of our competitors try to bimdle an entire lab-support 
system in one package and make an all-or-nothing sale. At In- 
teractive, we would rather service each need individually. You 
do a good job on one, and they come back for more." 

And what an Increasing number of scientists from all over 
the world kept coming back for was a solid product line of so- 
phisticated interface devices. It started with the AI02 Analog 
Input device, the first sixteen-channel analog-to-digital con- 
verter to hit the Apple market. The full DAISI product line now 
covers a multitude of data acquisition and signal generation 
applications. The A003 is a two, four, or eight channel digital- 
to-analog converter. The DI09 is a thirty-two-Une digital inter- 
face with timers, which can be expanded by the addition of a 
UI16 universal Isolated interface to control and monitor vari- 
ous types of circuits. The SC14 Signal Conditioner is a one, four, 
or sixteen channel device to amplify and filter very low voltage 
analog signals. And, after collecting and crunching so much 
data, a researcher may purchase a PL12 plotting system with 
interface to make visual displays of experimental results. 

With a growing product line and a solid niche in a special in- 
terest market. Interactive Structures had made the transition 
from systems house to product design and marketing. So 
strong was Interactive 's growing reputation in the laboratory 
systems market, that when University of Pennsylvania biolo- 
gist Allan Brown needed a special experimental controller, he 
came to Willson. 

"Allan had been studying circumnutation," explained Joe. 
"It's a process whereby a growing sprout will take a helical 
path upward rather than just shooting straight up. There's 
been speculation about why plants do this and some of the ex- 
planations make a connection between the process as it re- 
lates to the strength of the sprout growing against the force of 
gravity. 

"The experimental controller we developed used a stan- 
dard Apple II Plus motherboard and a variety of our off-the- 
shelf interface modules to control and gather data from a num- 
ber of environmental sensors and video cameras," Joe con- 
tinued. "The entire system is not really an unusual Apple- 
based laboratory installation — putting aside the special 
preparations." 

Where the Enemy Is Orange Juice. Preparations, that is, 
for space flight. Early next year. Interactive Structures's ex- 
perimental controller will blast off aboard the Space Shuttle 
with a payload of sunflower seeds to perform Dr. Brown's ex- 
periment in the weightless conditions of space. The extraordi- 
nary packaging requirements to withstand the rigors of space 
flight were demanding. Every connector and plug had to be se-

curely mounted to resist vibration during liftoff and re-entry. 
And every exposed circuit required meticulous coating with an 
insulating film to resist the Inadvertent damage of a freefloat- 
ing undissolved particle of Tang or other microscopic shuttle 
debris. 

"It was just the kind of commercially available technology 
NASA was looking for," Willson said; "low-cost applications to 
demonstrate the practicality of the shuttle program." 

Involvement in the development of the shuttle experiment 
controller and a generally healthy growth in the demand for 
Interactive Structures 's lab support products necessitated the 
first of two corporate relocations. In 1980, Interactive moved 
from a metropolitan area to outlying Bala Cynwyd, a suburb of 
Philadelphia. 

"While we were at a point where the company did need 
larger facilities," Joe reflected, "Michelle and I were Interest- 
ed in providing a healthy environment for our two sons. Bala 
Cynwyd seemed like a great place to live, and we're finding it a 
great place to do business. Shortly after moving, the pace of 
business picked up so much that I needed help, so I asked Mi- 
chelle to come in and help out." 

"That's when I started my career change," interjected Mi- 
chelle Kindt, who now performs a myriad of functions as a 
fully committed partner in the company. 

Joining the Cause to Grow. "My father was a business- 
man, and a good one," Kindt explained, "so I g^ess business is 
in my blood. I don't see myself going back to psychiatric nurs- 
ing, though sometimes around here it seems like I've never 
left!" She and Willson laughed along with a few disembodied 
employee chuckles from around the comer. 

"Actually, managing people is a good application of my 
professional skills," Michelle continued more seriously. "I'm 
looking forward to the challenge of developing this company 
into a solid medium-sized business. As corporate treasurer, I 
have taken on the responsibility for cash management and 
have worked increasingly at basic administration and sales or- 
ganization. I want to free Joe up to design to develop new 
producjts. 

"We've consistently funneled a significant proportion of our 
profits back into research and development," Michelle ex- 
plained, donning her management strategist's hat. "We've al- 
ready experienced the positive impact of research and devel- 
opment stimulating corporate growth following our develop- 
ment of the Pkaso product line, growth that allowed us to move 
here from around the comer where we only had about one 
third the space and a smaller staff." 

Kindt was referring to the Introduction of Interactive Struc- 
tures's first entry into the general consumer market. On the 
market since August 1980, Pkaso was officially unveiled at Ap- 
ple Expo '81 and was the first commercially available inter- 
face board to offer sophisticated graphics capabilities for Ap- 
ple-compatible dot matrix printers. The Pkaso series has ex- 
panded to include models that support most popular dot ma- 
trix printers, including the latest model, which allows dra- 
matic utilization of the graphics capabilities of the IDS full-col- 
or printer. 

"We've always been committed to customer support," Joe 
said. "It was essential in our early support of scientists assist- 
ing with their technical applications. And it's becoming even 
more important as our products begin attracting the more gen- 
eral user. Customer support means handling questions after 
the sale, but also means providing the user as close to a tum- 
key system as possible. 

"All our products come with a demonstration disk that in- 
cludes helpful software utilities to get the user up and running 
without having to become a sophisticated programmer. This 
software support is especially important in bringing full graph- 
ics capabilities to the general user market." 

Everything but Lick the Stamp. Not only does Interactive 
Structures provide a disk of software with each interface, but 
the label of the disk carries the full corporate mailing address 
and telephone number. Some manufacturers would say that's 



asking for trouble. Joe believes it is part of customer support. 

And who is around to support Joe and Michelle in support of 
their growing customer base? A tour of the new facility re- 
vealed an able staff. Each team member had a ready answer 
when asked specifically what his or her job was, a rarity in 
fast-growing companies. The old-timers spoke of what jobs 
they had held upon joining the company and how they had 
grown into greater responsibility. The recent additions told of 
learning a lot, quickly. All spoke of looking forward to oppor- 
tunities to grow with the company. 

Buttressing the management team, Morris Rubinoff has re- 
cently joined the company as manager of corporate develop- 
ment. A veteran of high-tech planning and a mentor from Joe 
Wlllson's Penn days, Morris is managing strategic planning 
with a special emphasis on research and development. Will- 
son expressed "tremendous respect for his technical and mana- 
gerial skills. His contribution has been significant not only to 
the company but to my personal development as well." 

Joan Hayden, director of marketing, reflected on her ca- 
reer at Interactive, "I came here as an office manager after 
having spent most of my life raising six children. Joe and Mi- 
chelle have encouraged me to accept more responsibility. I see 
an exciting job In spreading the good word. We have excellent 
products that I enjoy selling. This coming year, marketing will 
concentrate on increasing our advertising as well as our deal- 
er support program. And, of course, we'll continue to expand 
our users' support newsletter communications." 

Interactive Structures is probably one of the few manufac- 
turers that actually does follow through with keeping the user 
informed. Its newsletter, Tips d Techniques, Is a superb ex- 
ample of what can be done on a low budget with a dot matrix 
printer using a Pkaso interface. 

Show Us Your Super-Res Cows. On the technical side, Dave 
Turner is senior engineer. His Interactive roots go back to the 
Design for Fun exhibit. "I get to apply about everything I ever 
learned in computer science, splitting my time about equally 
between hardware and software development. Look what 
we've got the IDS doing," he proclaimed, showing a super-reso- 
lution full-color picture of a beach ball that took days to print. 
The ball looked as if it would roll off the page. 

In the room next to Dave's development den, Adam Sher- 
man was busy adjusting an oscilloscope to run quality control 
checks on interfaces being readied for shipment. "Since we 
sell a number of complex products used in precision applica- 
tions, quality control is extremely important," Adam noted. 
"As an applications engineer, I'm getting to see product devel- 
opment as well as leam the importance of good quality con- 
trol. I'm currently enrolled in the master's program in electri- 
cal engineering at Drexel University. This is a great oppor- 
tunity — getting to work with Joe, Dave, and Morris." 

At the opposite end of the technical lab was Rich Denver, 
laboratory assistant, busy unpacking and testing a shipment of 
memory chips. In the area between the lab and the front of- 
fice, Jameela Walker was busy carefully packing interfaces 
for delivery, while manager of shipping and receiving Helean 
O'Brien was hard at work expediting material flow from sup- 
pliers to component assembly site to the quality control lab and 
into the product distribution channels. 

Upon returning to the front office, Michelle Kindt noted, 
"We have three new employees starting tomorrow; a recep- 
tionist, a bookkeeper, and another applications engineer. It's 
all a part of our expansion plans to use the new space and meet 
demand for our products." 

What's next for Interactive Structures? "By the end of this 
summer we'll be adding new modular products to our lab sup- 
port line as well as adding to our printer Interface models," 
Joe Willson explained. "We have some exciting things in de- 
velopment — which I really can't talk about at this time." A cre- 
ative gleam came to life in his eyes. 

We should probably keep an ear to the ground for advance 
warning of whatever Joe Willson has in store for us. It is doubt- 
ful anyone would want to miss his next desigfn for fun. 



Breakthroughs occur once in a great while, when a

Rendezvous . . . the breakthrou g h is here. 

Rendezvous accurately simulates the orbital 
fli ght of a space shuttle craft. During the 
liftoff and orbital rendezvous stages, exact 
systems of ballistics and orbital mechanics 
require you to master Earth's gravitational 
force. Once you achieve orbit, the 
disorientation of a frictionless, 
zero-gravity environment 
complicates your maneuvers. 
Throughout the final stages of 
alignment and docking, you wil 
view the rotating, 3-dimensional 
space station as it would appear in a 
space craft's anterior window. 



From liftoff to docking, Rendezvous tests the limits 
of your technical understanding, mathematical 
judgment, and raw perceptual skill.

For many businesses — no matter what size — ^the office of 
the future represents the Promised Land. Computers and au- 
tomated equipment will theoretically improve productivity in 
administrative and information handling departments. 

The $60 billion a year office equipment market has vital- 
ized and given birth to many competing computer companies 
all wanting a piece of the pie. But the pie isn't getting sliced as 
fast as predicted. 

Fortune (May 3, 1982) tried to evaluate the problems hold- 
ing up the office of the future. The myth that computers are 
only good for secretaries and word processing is partially to 
blame. No one denies that word processing accounts for a huge 
chunk of that $60 billion each year. But, as Fortune points out, 
office automation has to go beyond secretaries and reach man- 
agers and professionals, who amass 80 percent of white collar 
salaries. Communicating data, writing documents, storing 
documents, and distributing written work are the four main 
activities of professionals, according to a major office equip- 
ment manufacturer. 

Some word processing systems make the control room of a 
nuclear power plant seem easy to understand. Professionals, 
like everybody else, can be intimidated by the myth of comput- 
ers. Resistance to change in these quarters generally centers 
on the notion that learning to use a computer is a long, compli- 
cated procedure, with uncertain benefits. 

Rumbling on through the P.L. Learning to use a micro- 
computer can be as easy as learning to drive a car. You must 
follow signs, be cautious, and never make certain mistakes. 
Several years ago, Steve Jobs came to the concliosion that both 
personal computers and cars have a wide range of applica- 
tions, most of which are not apparent at first. 



Apple Computer makes a business of selling microcomput- 
ers and they use their own machines for much of the daily op- 
erations of the company. Every employee with their own desk 
has an Apple II Plus or Apple III. Furthermore, Apple g^ves 
each employee a computer to take home after two months in 
what is known as the "loan to own" program. 

The use of microcomputers in the individual work station, 
along with a superb style of training employees, makes Apple 
a darn good example of the fabled Promised Land. 

Walking through Apple Computer's spacious nest of build- 
ings in Santa Clara Valley, one is strongly tempted to move in- 
to the garage and start tinkering with old TV sets. Six years 
ago, none of it existed. Now, the sun never sets on the Apple 
empire. Seeing the American Dream work so well is almost 
painful. For the many who fail at business, the dream is filled 
with holes. 

Jealous musing aside, the labor of the moment entails an 
overview of how Apple Computer uses Apple computers. The 
following individuals do not account for all the uses Apple 
makes of their own computers ; more articles would be needed 
to paint a complete picture. Nonetheless, we have covered 
many different departments, with the goal of showing as wide 
a spectrum of users and applications as possible. 

For Whom the Type Tolls. Teri Carver is area associate for 
Rob Campbell, product marketing manager. Area associates 
are graded A, B, or C. Carver is a B. She works in the personal 
computer systems division building, otherwise known as Band- 
ley Three. 

Working most on an Apple III using Apple software, Car- 
ver produces memos, reports, mailing lists, and other paper- 
work. She is in charge of maintaining the office, scheduling 



JUNE 1982 S C) T ATirp 53 



meetings, sorting mail, taking incoming phone calls, and traf- 
ficking electronic messages through Micro-Courier and Ac- 
cess in, Apple's time-sharing network. 

"I'm on the Apple III almost 40 percent of the day. It saves 
so much time and it's very easy to use. I'm learning new things 
all the time." 

Before she came to work at Apple eight months ago. Car- 
ver knew nothing about computers. A native of San Jose, Carver 
had gfrown weary of secretarial Jobs that involve routines and 
procedures that eventually get stale. Apple, with its spectacu- 
lar growth and energetic pace, is far from dull and routine yet. 

In keeping with a sometime tradition for new employees. 
Carver unpacked and assembled her Apple III the second 
week on the job. Demythologizing the computer is a good train- 
ing procedure that starts with this preliminary introduction. 

Besides using their own computers, Apple incorporates 
their own software wherever possible. Carver uses Apple Writ- 
er III, Mail List Manager, and VisiCalc III and is just learning 
Apple III Business Graphics. 

Generally, Carver has had little trouble adapting to the 
technology, but if something is not clear, she doesn't have far 
to go to find help. The combination of Apple's easy-to-use prod- 
ucts and employee training makes incorporating relatively un- 
trained newcomers into the company a simple thing. 

"They made me feel like part of the team right from the be- 
ginning," explains the now veteran Carver. 

Carver's boss, Rob Campbell, is an example of a manager 
using the computer for purposes that normally would have 
been part of a secretary's job. Instead of dictating memos, 
Campbell writes them up on Apple Writer and gives the disk to 
Carver. It saves both the bosses and the associates time. 

Other area associates in the personal computer systems di- 
vision building praise the Apple. Lynn McCleery, Ken Gil- 
bert's associate, proclaims happily: "No retyping of memos!" 

Where Legal Eagles Dare. The legal department of Apple 
holes up on the second floor of Bandley Six. They use Apples 
for word processing and telecommunications. 

Audrey Keltner is area associate for David Kopf , an asso- 
ciate counsel. She calls the Apple "a glorified tjrpewriter," but 
admits after a spell, "that's probably an understatement." 
Keltner started working at Apple March 1, this year, and she 
had had no previous experience with microcomputers. "I 
hadn't even seen one." 

Contracts, letters, agreements, guidelines, and manuals 
(procedures for dealers) are all composed on the Apple. The 
bosses probably use them as much as the associates. 

Jackie Johnson, area associate for Dan Wendln, another 
associate counsel, puts it like this: "The computer has really 
broken down the barrier between the chiefs and the Indians." 

Johnson has been at Apple ten months and works exclu- 
sively on a III. Her boss does all his own typing and "frees me 
to do other things. There is very little of the deadly repetitive 
work usually done by a secretary." 

When a company is growing at a healthy pace, fast and 
painless training of new employees is of paramount impor- 
tance. The promise of computer technology in the office no 
longer has to raise fears of employees losing their heads out of 
fnistration. 

Where the Big Boys Are. Inc. Magazine (May 1982) rated 
Apple Computer number one on their list of the 100 fastest 
growing publicly held companies. In the last five years, Apple 
showed an increase in sales of 43,154 percent. The runner-up, 
Electro-Biology (Fairfield, N.J.) , posted an increase in sales of 
11,184 percent. 

The end of fiscal 1982 may see Apple in the Fortune 500. 
With sales in excess of $450 million expected this year, the pro- 
duction department has its work cut out. Many business tasks 
cry out for a personal computer, but the bigger the business, 
the bigger the demands. 

Located somewhere in Bandley One are four DEC 1170 
mainframe computers, diligently hauling in the mass of data 
from Apple's manufacturing sites. 

Apple has three main manufacturing plants, two of them 
overseas. The biggest one, in Dallas, with more than 600 em- 



ployees, makes all the Apple lis for the domestic and Asian 
markets, Apple Ills, and disk drives. The plant in Singapore 
concentrates on circuit boards, while the plant in Ireland has 
been making Apple lis and is just starting Ills. 

Keeping track of the production effort is the function of the 
manufacturing and materiel planning department. Manufac- 
turing systems manager Mike Jamison uses an Apple III, Visi- 
Calc, and Access III to wrestle the information to the mat. 

"The DEC is too impersonal. A user cannot manipulate 
data in a large system like this because it's not in the right 
format." 

Providing exact information on the overall production is the 
ultimate goal of Jamison's department. Many smaller tasks 
are incorporated within this larger effort. Chief among these is 
the daily production schedule but there is also inventory, bill 
schedules, the purchasing master schedule, traffic, and 
forecasting. 

The production schedule is downloaded to the specific sites 
through the DEC. In the same way, figures on the cost of build- 
ing product, component failures, inventory levels, labor re- 
ports, and efficiency reports are sent to Cupertino. 

With the up-to-date information coming in on the DEC, 
Jamison and his co-workers can make work in progress re- 
ports. They generate real time inventories. Labor data and 
yield data help to organize the production schedule. 

The MRP, short for materiel requirement plan, shows how 
much materiel needs to be ordered at the beginning of each 
month. Running all weekend, the DEC handles the actual 
MRP, but the Apple III with VisiCalc offers the opportunity for 
quick and dirty "what if?" calculations. 

Besides VisiCalc, Jamison uses Magic Window for word 
processing, and Apple's Apple III Btisiness Graphics for mak- 




Tcri Carocr 

Pcoonal Computer ^v^tcm^ Di\7i^ion 



ing charts and diagrams. The latter he says is "really great." 

Jamison, a former materiels manager at Texas Instru- 
ments, was one of the first eighteen people hired on at Apple's 
Dallas plant. He left two months ago to come to Cupertino. He 
prefers the III over the II because it can act as a terminal in 
addition to being a personal computer. 

Needless to say, Jamison decries the lack of game paddles 
for the III. A big fan of computer games, Jamison often leaves 
the world of materiels and manufacturing far behind when he 
gets home to his own Apple. 

Where Taxes Never Set on the Empire. Combining a large 
computer system with personal computers as work stations is 
a good way to outfit large information-handling departments. 
Apple's accounting department uses the DEC system in much 
the same way as materiels and manufacturing. Accounting in- 
formation from many locations comes to Cupertino, where it is

then processed on Apples. 

Making a lot of money means paying a lot of taxes. Prepar- 
ing taxes for a large corporation usually entails a small army 
of irritable clerks battling a mountain of paperwork. 

The tax department at Apple is barely a year old. Before it 
was set up, taxes were sent to an outside accounting firm. 

Joe Forgy is manager of Tax Compliance and Linda Villar- 
real is a tax accountant. Together they work with tax director 
Mike Rashkin and a small staff in Bandley One preparing the 
quarterly and yearly tax reports and returns. 

Apple is actually comprised of twenty corporations spread 
out over the world. They are all part of Apple Computer Incor- 
porated, but for legal purposes, the corporations are treated as 
separate entities. Each corporation has its own taxes and tax 
laws, depending on where it's located. 

Every year state and local taxes have to be filed for each 
Apple company. Then there are the taxes for Apple Computer 
altogether. This is just the beginning; it gets much, much more 
complicated. 

The Apple III and VisiCalc make the labor of tax compli- 
ance not quite such an uphill battle. It still takes four people 
working full-time, but not fifteen. Forgy's previous job in- 
volved a tax department with just such a number of 
employees. 

Each quarter's tax provision involves numerous financial 
statements, and when it comes to the closing process, num- 
bers can change fast and frequently. VisiCalc allows for far 
more, flexibility in this process. You just drop a number in its 
proper spot and the program changes all the other numbers to 
reflect the new one. 

In the old days, if there was a last minute change in the con- 
solidated profit total, for instance, it would mean manually ad- 




mikG Jamison 

manuFacturing ^y^tcm^ manager 

justing every calculation — a matter of days. Now a change like 
this takes only a matter of hours. 

Last minute changes are not the only thing VisiCalc is good 
for. In the area of forecasting and planning, it allows for a 
much larger degree of decision making. 

"With the analytical functions built into the program you 
find more people using brain power instead of pencil push- 
ing," explains Forgy. 

Forgy and Villarreal use VisiCalc for forecasting — project- 
ing what the taxes for next year will be like. They can take in- 
to account property, sales, payroll, and more subtle factors 
that effect the outcome. 

Time is important to the tax department and electronic 
mail has helped to speed up the process a great deal. Each di- 
vision of Apple sends its tax information to Cupertino in a fast- 
er and more reliable fashion than the U.S. Postal Service. 



"When you're trying to figure out the labyrinth of sales tax 
for different states and you have a deadline of a couple of days, 
there is no time to wait for intercompany mail." 

Filing state taxes involves calculations concerning appor- 
tionment factors, taking into account special increases or de- 
creases in the tax rate. By the time you get to deductions, the 
whole job seems like a colossal headache. 

A veteran of past tax wars, Forgy is very pleased with how 
the department performs and has nothing but good words for 
the computer. 

"If people would learn to use this tool, with a format that 
never changes like VisiCalc, you would see a lot of tax depart- 
ments in big companies cut in half." 

Enjoying the Company of Computers. A common charac- 
teristic of Apple the company and Apple the computer keeps

popping up — friendliness. The offices look a little bland, but the 
atmosphere and oft-touted esprit de corps more than make up 
for the landscape. 

If new employees are what Terry Carver defines as "really 
motivated and energetic," they'll discover the environment 
challenging as well as friendly. At Apple the company it's easy 
to get people to listen to new ideas. 

Mark Vermilion started working in Apple's public rela- 
tions department a little over two months ago. He's never used 
an Apple II, but he's taken to the III fast enough. Before this 
job. Vermilion had only had some brief experience in word 
processing. 

Writer and editor of technical publicity is Vermilion's main 
occupation; he also contributes to Apple's monthly employee 
newspaper. Vermilion has ideas for improving the public rela- 
tions' clipping department, and interested ears have turned his 
way. 

Apple's public relations agency. Regis McKenna, among 
their other toils, collects all the stories and mentions of Apple 
and competitors printed in newspapers and magazines. A clip- 
ping service in Arizona was hired by McKenna to do the enor- 
mous task of flipping through mountains of periodicals, both 
foreign and domestic. 

The clippings are sent to Regis McKenna where they're Xe- 
roxed and then sent over to Apple. Once they're at Apple, the 
clippings have to be routed to the proper managers, supervi- 
sors, and executives. The whole process can take up to eight 
weeks and is somewhat inefficient. 

There are already ten to fifteen newspapers available on 
telecommunications networks like the Source and Compu- 
Serve. Soon there should be hundreds, in addition to maga- 
zines and even books. An electronic clipping service would pull 
those items relating to Apple Computer and put them in 
storage. 

With an intelligent photocopier it would be possible to digi- 




mark \7Grmilion 

Technical publicity 



tize articles from magazines and send them over modem to 
any Apple employee who should desire such a thing. A manag- 
er in Dallas could call up with a request and, in a matter of 
minutes, he would have the whole article, more or less how it 
looked when originally published. 

Vermilion's grand scheme would include a catalog of em- 
ployees on disk that would indicate what kinds of clippings go 
to each one. When items came in they would be coded and a 
program would automatically send them to all the right 
people. 

None of this has happened yet, but Vermilion is very 



T A L 1^ JUNE 1982 

pleased with the response he's gotten from Apple. With 3,100 
employees, some are bound to be unsatisfied. Most are like 
Vermilion, excited and happy. 

The public relations department on the whole uses Apples 
for many things. The process of putting out a press release 
alone is usually complicated enough to warrant a headache or 
two. The PR department writes up the initial copy which is 
sent to the department that it concerns for verification. The 
finished release is sent to Regis McKenna, who'll use it as 
background data for dealing with the media. 

McKenna has recently been outfitted with Apples, modem, 
and Micro-Courier to speed up the process. What could take al- 
most a week of physically routing paper, now takes a day or 
less. 

Renee Olson, manager of community affairs and internal 
communication, as well as a writer of technical publicity, says 
that without the Apple her work would take twenty times as 
long. 

Olson's boss, manager of consumer programs Phil Roybal, 
uses Apple III Business Graphics and VisiCalc to track bud- 
gets. Everywhere you look. Apples are lurking. 

Where There Are Sounds of Silence. Building a large com- 
pany involves a myriad of details, some of which must come 
later than others. Fairly crucial parts of the company orga- 
nism are often undernourished until the most important parts 
are healthy. 

Information is the major commodity of the new age and Ap- 
ple exists because it's in the business of information handling. A 
central knowledge-gathering organ for use by all Apple em- 
ployees will become increasingly important in the hectic years 
ahead. 

About six months ago Apple hired on Manlca Ertel as the 
corporate librarian. They gave her an office and told her to 
start putting together a collection of computer books and 
periodicals. Ertel has a masters degree in library science and 
has organized libraries for several large companies, including

Paper? Ah, We Don't Need No Stinking Paper. The actual 
exchange of materials with other libraries goes on in the usual 
fashion, by U.S. mail. The day will come, hopefully soon, when 
the complete magazine article or book can be easily obtained 
directly from a remote location. Ertel dreams of the day when 
there will be no paper in the library. Everything will be gotten 
through and stored in the computer. 

Ertel and Macek keep a list on Apple Writer of Apple em- 
ployees who regularly request certain magazines. When the 
latest issue of, say, Call-A.P.P.L.E. comes in, the list is polled 
for all the requests. The interested employees are then sent a 
Photostated copy of the table of contents. 

Journals are not often circulated out of the library, but a 
phone call or letter to the library gamers Photostated copies of 
specific articles. This whole process could benefit from elec-

"At Memorex it was very slow at the beginning. I had to 
shop for customers. At Apple it's been a different thing alto- 
gether. People here are information oriented. They're already 
familiar with on-line data services and are capable of having a 
dialogue with an information system." 

Apples are used in the library for just about everything but 
putting the books on the shelf. Robotics may fix that in a decade or 
so. 

With the help of Datalog, an electronic card catalog pro- 
gram, the Apple III hooked up to Profile takes the place of a 
traditional card catalog. Circulation records are kept up-to- 
date using Datalog as well. 

It takes a matter of seconds to determine who has checked 
out a particular book or periodical, when it is due, and how

much it costs to replace. Lists containing the total amount of 
books circulating and who has them can be generated easily. 

With Access III, Ertel and library technical assistant 
Rosanne Macek make interlibrary loans to and from thou- 
sands of other libraries. Stanford and Lockheed offer database 
services that include catalogs from many collections across 
the country. Books can be looked for by author, title, subject

tronic mail. With Access III and Micro-Courier there would be 
a lot less phone-calling and photocopying. 

Macek works with Personal Filing System to keep track of 
purchasing and book orders. Libraries have to keep on budget 
like everybody else. It is important to determine how best to 
spend your money before you actually spend it. 

Located temporarily in the building affectionately called 
Big Bub, the library is a mile or so from the main hub of ac- 
tivity at Apple. This means fewer people are dropping by to 
browse in person, but all the other services are booming. 
Sometime soon the library will move over to the Bandley Two; 
Ertel "can't wait to get back to civilization." 

Electronic mail is used for sending short library messages. 
It's a funny thing, but according to Ertel, there is some lazi- 
ness on the part of some Apple employees. "They forget to 
check their mail boxes." The whole idea is so new that even 
people working in a high-tech company are not used to it yet." 

One thing that Ertel would like to see happen, but she is not 
sure just when that might be, is a collection of software. At this 
point, there isn't even a centralized collection of Apple's own 
software. The employee store offers Apple software at cost, in 
conjunction with the loan-to-own-program, but the store is a 
good half hoiir away by car from Cupertino. 

A software collection and getting actual articles on-line 
from other libraries are the two main improvements that Ertel 
would like to see. For the moment, the Ubrary at Apple is grow- 
ing, striving to meet the information needs of an growing in- 
formation company. 

Where Beautiful Downtown Cupertino Presents. Every big 
company should have a library and every big company should 
have a newspaper. Apple has its house organ; it's called Appie 
Times. No one has mentioned a radio station yet, but let's not 



be hasty. 

In the April issue of Apple Times there is an article about 
the personal computer systems (PCS) division publications de- 
partment. These are the folks that write software manuals and 
they use Apples all through the process. 

According to the article, manuals are written in four stages 
starting with the document design. Project members review 
the first, or "alpha" draft of the manual and their comments 
may affect the product itself as well as the second, or "beta" 
draft of the documentation. 

Selected individuals and outside companies review the be- 
ta draft. Once again, comments bring about a few changes that 
the writer incorporates into the final draft. This final draft is 
checked thoroughly by an editor in the PCS division publica- 
tions department. 

Manuals start out as Pascal text files, each containing all or 
part of a chapter. The files are run through Apple's text for- 
matting program Script. This prints all the files as one contin- 
uous draft with space for illustrations, page numbers, and cor- 
rectly positioned section titles. The completed manual is 
printed out on a Qume printer, sent to graphics for paste-up, 
and finally to a local printer. 

Try as you might, there's no denying hindsight. Products 
often go through corrections and changes once they're on the 
market. The manual update group uses the Apple III and Ac- 
cess III to tap the mainframes and produce addenda, errata 
sheets, and other revisions. 

Typesetting is accomplished with a Compugraphlc ma- 
chine that accepts Pascal text files. Formatting commands 
imbedded in the text instruct the Compugraphlc 's typesetting 
activities. It saves time in proofreading because the process 
uses the author's diskette files rather than re-keyboarded 
copy. 

The Apple Times is produced in this fashion. Editor Judy 
Ann Christensen uses Apple Writer to compose articles and 
then converts them to Pascal. After that the Compugraphlc 
machine does its stuff. 



Christensen works at home one or two days a month and 
works odd hours at Apple, whenever the writing mood strikes. 
"You'd be surprised at the number of people still here at 11 
p.m." 

Although she really wanted to be a freelance writer, Chris- 
tensen found Apple "a better deal." Nevertheless, she writes 
an occasional article for an outside magazine and truly appre- 
ciates the generosity of Apple. Bonuses, in the guise of "au- 
thor incentive," are given to any employee who is published. 

"What I got from Apple was about four times what the 
magazine paid me." 

Where the Sphinx Keeps Its Secrets. It's safe to say that Ap- 
ple's current product line will not dominate the office equip- 
ment market of the future. That's current product line. 

A perfectly normal-looking biiilding is the home of future 
products. Few people hear about what goes on in there ; indus- 
trial espionage is not a casual threat. 

We haven't delved into hardware and software develop- 
ment and how Apple uses Apples in these areas. Rest assured, 
they're used, but how and for what purpose must remain a 
mystery. 

Not terribly surprising is the fact that Apple uses Apples all 
throughout the company. It's good advertising to practice what 
you preach. 

The surprising thing is how well the technology works when 
put through such rigorous tests. The Apple III, in particular, is 
depended on for so many things. Apple is a smoothly-run com- 
pany and their own products are a major reason why. 

The uncertain economic climate of the future makes con- 
ducting business even more of a gamble than usual. Increas- 
ing office productivity must occur if American companies are 
going to survive against foreign competition and the high cost 
of survival itself. 

Each company's Promised Land may or may not have an 
Apple computer in it. Nonetheless, there's at least one compa- 
ny that uses them a lot and has found them reliable tools of the 
information age. n 

ASSEMBLY LINES: 



THE BOOK 




For months we've been telling you Roger Wagner's Assembly Lines: The Book is great. 
We've been telling you it'll make your Apple's 6502 jump up, spit in the air, and dance 
around like James Brown. 

But don't take our word for it. The author himself in the introduction soys it more 
eloquently than we ever could. 

"This book does not attempt to cover every aspect of machine language program- 
ming. It does, however, provide the necessary information and guidance to allow even 
a somewhat inexperienced person to learn machine language in a minimum of time. 
You should find the text and examples quite readable, without being overwhelmed by 
technical jargon or too much material being presented at once." 

Loops, branches, COUT, paddles, addressing modes, the stack, shift operators, logi- 
cal operators: Wagner covers them all in Assembly Lines: The Book. 

$19.95 gets you more than 270 pages of graphs, listings, and exercises. Written in a 
style Wagner hod fifteen months to polish in the pages of Soffaik, Assembly Lines: The 
Book is a must for anyone serious about learning machine language programming on 
the Apple II.

SOFICARD 
Symposium 

by Greg TSbbetts 



Welcome to the Symposium for June. After your expe- 
rience with ED.COM last month in the alteration of the source 
file for Digital Research's program DUMP.ASM, you are 
ready to put that work to use by assembling the program with 
ASM.COM, the subject of this month's column. Those of you 
who have not had the opportunity to work in assembly lan- 
guage may not have a clear grasp of just what these terms 
mean, so we'll take a few paragraphs to cover the basics. 

Most of you know that the heart of a microcomputer is its 
microprocessor. It is this unit that performs most of the work 
in the system. Although there are many such processors, the 
three of concern to us are the 6502, the Apple's primary pro- 
cessor; the Z-80, the processor used on the SoftCard; and the 
8080, the processor CP/M was written to run on and for which 
the standard CP/M utilities were designed. The fact that the Z- 
80 was designed to execute code written for the 8080 is the rea- 
son that many CP/M products are still distributed in 8080 form, 
since that way they will be compatible with systems having ei- 
ther processor. 

Each processor is designed by its manufacturer to recog- 
nize and respond to a certain set of numeric codes. Each of 
these codes corresponds to a specific instruction or operation; 
consequently, the set of codes for a processor is called its in- 
struction set. By arranging the instructions in various ways we 
can create programs that cause the processor to perform use- 
ful functions. Since these programs are made up of the nu- 
meric instruction codes executed by the machine, the pro- 
grams are said to be written in machine language and are 
sometimes called machine code or object code. 

Although the processor responds to these numeric codes, 
we humans need something much more descriptive. While it is 
possible for us to program using only numbers, a set of char- 
acter representations or words that sound like the operation 
they describe make life much simpler. Such words in the field 
of assembly language are called mnemonics. The 8080 mne- 
monics JNZ, for Jump if condition is Non-Zero, and SCF, for Set 
Carry Flag, for example, are far easier to remember and use 
than the hexadecimal numbers C2 and 37. 

Each microprocessor manufacturer publishes a list of in- 
struction mnemonics corresponding to the processor's in- 
struction set. Volume I of the SoftCard manual contains a list 
of the Intel 8080 mnemonics, along with brief descriptions of 
the operations performed. Obviously, though, some method of 
translation is needed to create the numeric machine instruc- 
tions from the mnemonics. This is where the special utility pro- 
grams called assemblers come in, performing this translation 
in a process called assembly. 

The other primary function of assemblers is to allow the 
substitution of names — called labels or symbols — for actual ad- 
dresses and data during the creation of a source file. This is a 
critical facility, since a great many machine instructions ref- 
erence memory locations in their execution, whether to load or 
store data from or to the address, to jump to an address, or to 
perform some operation on the data at an address. Without this 
substitution feature, all of the address references and other in- 
formation would have to be figured out by hand before typing 
in the program since many, if not most, are within the pro- 



I Ill 



gram itself. Also, once completed, a progfram would have to be 
extensively rewritten if even a single instruction were added or 
if the starting address were changed. 

An assembler source file is said to be completely relocat- 
able, since when you change the address that tells the assem- 
bler where to start the program, the assembler will calculate 
the addresses of the various labels and install them wherever 
they are later referenced. In the same way that the instruc- 
tions and features of Basic go together to form the Basic lan- 
guage, the mnemonics and features of assemblers go together 
to form assembly language. And just as with Basic, which 
comes in many varieties, there are many kinds of assemblers, 
each with greater or fewer features and different ways of han- 
dling the same essential function. 

Nearly all assemblers operate in a similar manner; they 
act on a text file (called the source file) that contains mne- 
monic instructions, labels, and symbols to produce an object 
code file that is executable by the processor. Different assem- 
blers carry out this process somewhat differently — some in a 
series of stages that use special linking or loading programs — 
but the general principles are the same. Although some pseudo 
or mini assemblers require typing in the mnemonics and ac- 
tual addresses directly into the memory locations at which 
they will run (as with the A option of DDT.COM) , suffice it to 
say that a true assembler deals in files and has label and sym- 
bol substitution capabilities. 

There is one other factor all assemblers share ; it is the use 
of pseudo-ops. The term pseudo-op, which is derived from the 
fact that processor instructions are often called op-codes, re- 
fers to mnemonics that are actually directives to the assem- 
bler itself, rather than processor instructions. Pseudo-ops are 
used in cases where something must be done that does not in- 
volve the processor, such as having the assembler place data 
into a program to be used by the program at run time, or tell- 
ing the assembler where in memory you wish a program to 
run. Typically, the number of pseudo-ops is in proportion to the 
versatility of the assembler itself. The statements, then, that 
comprise a specific assembler's version of assembly language 
are made up of the processor op-codes and the assembler pseu- 
do-ops. A description of the allowed ASM pseudo-ops follows: 

ORG xxxx Sets start address op-codes or data that follow to xxxx. 
END xxxx Indicates program end. If xxxx present, it indicates that the first 
instruction of the program is at xxxx. 
yyyy EQU xxxx Used to set a label or symbol yyyy to value xxxx. Once defined, 

yyyy may not be redefined to a new value, 
yyyy SET xxxx Has same function as EQU but unlike EQU, yyyy may be rede- 
fined later in the program with another SET. 
IF X Begin conditional assembly, that is, test value or expression x. If 

true, assemble the op-codes that follow until ENDIF encountered. If 
false, ignore same statements. 
ENDIF End conditional assembly. 

DB X Define byte(s) x. x may be numbers, symbols or ASCII data in 

quotes. Values corresponding to x will be placed in memory. Any 
number of values may follow separated by commas. 

DW X Define word(s) x. Same as DB, except two byte values. 

DS X Define x bytes of space. 

With the exception of the conditional assembly capability, it 
would be hard to find an assembler that did not Include the

pseudo-ops just described, since they are probably the mini- 
mum number needed to make the assembler a useful tool. In 
actuality, though, if you're just starting out in assembly lan- 
guage, a simpler assembler like ASM is best, since it allows 
you to do almost everything without adding the confusion of the 
extra bells and whistles. The discussion of ASM found in Vol- 
ume I of the SoftCard manual is brief, but gives a good over- 
view of the terminology used in assembly language and of the 
function of ASM under certain stated conditions. It is recom- 
mended that you familiarize yourself with this section and the 
instruction-set description before proceeding. A tutorial-type 
text on 8080 programming would be of value to you as well. 

ASM.COM is a relocating 8080 assembler that uses Intel 
mnemonics and produces an intermediate file in the Intel hex 
format that is then converted to object code with a loader 
called L0AD.COM. The machine instructions it generates will 
be executable on the SoftCard Z80, but since it is an 8080 as- 
sembler, it will not be able to take advantage of any of the ex- 
tra Z80 features. For that reason, you can assume that you are 
dealing with an 8080 environment, and in addition to the 8080 
op-codes, you will be limited to the following registers and in- 
ternal processor structure. 

To simplify matters, there are only seven discrete parts to 
the processor we will discuss. They are: The accumulator [A]; 
The flag byte [FB]; The program counter [PC]; The stack 
pointer [SP] ; The HL register pair [HL] ; The DE register pair 
[DE]; The BC register pair [BC]. In order, their characteris- 
tics follow: 

[A] This unit is an eight-bit register. It is where one of the 
operands used in any arithmetic or logical operation must re- 
side and where the result of that operation will be placed. Free 
movement of eight-bit values may be made between [A] and 
any other general purpose register or memory location, and 
values not exceeding eight bits may be placed into it directly 
(called immediate moves) . 

[FB] This unit is an eight-bit register that does not contain 
data per se, but rather consists of eight single-bit flag^ (only 
five are actually defined) that change based on the operation 
just completed by the processor. Typically, operations per- 
formed in [A] affect the flags based on the result. The flags are 
sign, zero, aiur., carry, parity, and carry. The only two we're 
concerned with are zero and carry. If, after an operation af- 
fecting it, the result left in [A] is 00, then the zero flag is set to 1 ; 
if not, then the zero flag is reset to 0. Note that it is not affected 
by load operations. The carry flag is used during arithmetic 
operations to indicate overflow of binary calculations into the 
ninth bit position (borrow and carry) . It is also used in rotate 
instructions (where all bits in [A] are shifted left or right) to 
hold the bit that is shifted out and to supply the bit to be shifted 
in. [A] and [FB] from a sixteen-bit unit called the processor 
status word [PSW]. 

[PC] This sixteen-bit unit contains the memory address of 
the next instruction to be fetched and executed by the proces- 
sor. Based on the length of the instruction (predefined by the 
manufacturer) , it is incremented to where the next instruction 
should be each time the current instruction is completed. With 
a few exceptions, it is not directly accessible to the program- 
mer. 

[SP] This sixteen-bit unit contains the memory address of 
the processor's next stack location. The stack is where regis- 
ter data, return addresses, and such are stored when there is 
need to preserve them during subsequent operations. [PC] is 
stored there, for example, when calls to subroutines are made, 
so that at the end of the subroutine, a return instruction will 
pull the old [PC] contents out of the stack and place them back 
in [PC]. Execution will then continue where it left off. Although 
[SP] cannot be said to be a general purpose register, its con- 
tents are under the control of the programmer so the stack can 
be relocated to a different area if desired. All other register 
contents, including those of [PSW], can be placed on the stack 
using PUSH instructions and retrieved using POP instruc- 
tions. 

[HL] This sixteen-bit unit is a general purpose sixteen-bit 
register which can also be treated as two eight-bit registers — 



[H] and [L]. Operations done between registers are much fast- 
er and shorter than between registers and memory locations, 
and therefore movement of data between registers is prefer- 
able. Also, since addresses are always sixteen-bit numbers, us- 
ing the sixteen-bit register instructions is preferable when ad- 
dresses must be calculated or otherwise manipulated. 

[DE] This sixteen-bit unit is functionally the same as [HL], 
with the exception that it cannot be used for certain kinds of 
load operations. Those are not of interest to us here. 

[BC] This sixteen-bit unit is functionally the same as [DE]. 

For our purposes, the description just given, though incom- 
lete, is sufficient. Now that we have defined the basics and you 
have familiarized yourself with the ASM documentation, we 
can begin to examine what we did last month in our modifica- 
tions to DUMP. ASM. We said that we would functionally 
change the program in three ways : we would make it recog- 
nize whether it was in a forty or an eighty column environ- 
ment and format its output accordingly ; we would cause it to 
separate the address from the data with a colon ; and we would 
cause two blank lines to be printed to separate 128-byte rec- 
ords. 

The first change, forty versus eighty columns, is by far the 
largest and most complex change; we'll examine it first. In 
this and our other changes, refer to the listing shown in figure 
1. Line numbers referenced will be those running down the left 
margin. Note the preceding 0 and trailing H whenever we spec- 
ify a hexadecimal number in the column. This is the normal 
notation with 8080/Z80 assemblers to specify hexadecimal 
numbers and it's a good idea to get used to it. Most assemblers 
default to decimal for numeric constants and require an ex- 
plicit H for hex and B for binary if you wish to input in those 
forms. The preceding 0 is needed because when he numbers 
have A,B,C,D,E, or F as the first digit, the assembler needs a 
way to determine whether it is a number or a label. 

DUMP'S normal operation is to open the named file, read in 
its contents and then take each numeric byte and translate it 
into two ASCII characters to be output to the screen. DUMP 
also keeps track of the relative address of the byte (beginning at 
OOOOH) and prints this address every sixteen bytes. The prob- 
lem with DUMP for the Apple is that many SoftCard owners 
still use their forty-column Apple screen, and since sixteen dis- 
played bytes (32 characters plus spaces plus addresses) ex- 
ceeds forty characters, the output wraps around and gets hard 
to read. 

To correct this problem, we first need to determine wheth- 
er a terminal or eighty-column board is installed in the Apple. 
This is made easier by the fact that SoftCard CP/M requires 
such devices to be in slot 3 and only slot 3. As discussed in pre- 
vious columns, SoftCard maintains a slot-type table in the I/O 
Configuration Block. The value of the card in a particular slot 
can be found at 0F3B8H + slot number, or 0F3BBH for slot 3, 
and will be one greater than the type number found on page 1-2 
of Volume I of the SoftCard manual. Since, for the purposes of 
this program, we can assume that any serial card, com card, 
or newer type-6 firmware card in slot three is an eighty-col- 
umn device, we really only need to exclude values of 00, (no 
card), or 05 (Apple parallel printer card). Once the presence 
or absence of a card is determined, we need program state- 
ments to test the environment for the number of columns and 
then, if it is forty, break the output of bytes when that line's 
byte count reaches eight. At that point, we will output a Car- 
riage Return/Linefeed (CRLF) sequence and also print suffi- 
cient spaces so that we start the second eight bytes immedi- 
ately under the first. 

Implementing this first step requires that we examine the 
slot-types table and set up a data location within the program 
(called a flag) that will be set to OOH if forty columns, or OFFH 
if eighty columns when execution begins. It will be easier if we 
can refer to the flags as labels or symbols, so we will define the 
label SLT3 to be equal to 0F3BBH using the EQU pseudo-op in 
line 16 and set up the flag location with the label FLAG using 
the DS pseudo-op in line 247. Now we can use SLT3 and FLAG 
in future instructions to reference these addresses. We will do 
this now in lines 52 through 60 where we examine the slot type 



table and set up the FLAG data area. These nine instructions 
perform the following logical sequence of operations. 

1. LDA SLT 3 [A] is loaded from memory location SLT3. 

2. ORA A A logical OR is done between the value in [A] 
and itself. This has no effect on that value since any binary 
number OR'd with an equal binary number results in no 
change. It is used here because ORA affects the zero flag in 
[FB). If the value is 00. then the zero flag will be set. 

3. JZ COL40 This op-code causes a jump to the indicated 
label (line 57) if the zero flag is set, i.e., no card in slot 3. 

4. SUI 5 This instruction subtracts 5 from the value in [A]. 
The result will set or reset the zero bit based on the result. 
Since we wish to do forty-column output only if the value in 
SLT3 is 00 or 05, this instruction tests the remaining case. 

5. JNZ ONWRD This op-code causes a jump to the indi- 
cated label (line 59 if the zero flag is not set. If the value was 
not 05, the result will be nonzero and the jump will occur. 

6. MVI A.O This instruction, with the label COL40:, is 
where we go if we have a forty-column environment. Here we 
load [A] with 00, since MVI A,0 stands for MoVe Immediate 00 
into [A]. 

7. DB 1 This pseudo-op places an OlH into memory at this 
point in the program. Its purpose is to install the numeric op- 
code for LXI B into the program without defining the two bytes 
which would have to follow if we used the LXI B mnemonic, a 
sixteen-bit load of [BC] with the two bytes that follow. As such It 
is a programming "trick" and should probably not be used 
here. However, it is a way to save space and is mentioned only 
for that possible value. Its effect in this case is to load the next 
two bytes (which form instruction #8 below) as data into [BC] 
rather than execute them as an instruction. Effectively, this is 
a way to skip over them with a single byte rather than using a 
separate jump instruction that takes three bytes. 

8. MVI A,OFFH This two byte instruction, with the label 
ONWRD:, loads [A] with OFFH, indicating an eighty-column 
device in slot 3. It is this instruction that gets skipped by the 
LXI B above if we were in forty columns and already loaded 
[A] with 00. 

9. STAFLAG This op-code STores the contents of [A] in the 
data location FLAG, and sets our flag location to either 00 for 
forty or OFFH for eighty columns. 

Now that we've set up our flag, we can check it at any time 
during program execution to see what our environment is. We 
now go on to make the modifications to perform forty-column 
output if required. We do this starting at line 76 and proceed- 
ing for seventeen instructions through line 92. Originally, the 
DUMP program at this point checked the address counter 
([HL] — high-order byte in [H], low in [L]) to see if sixteen 
bytes had been printed. If not, a jump to the label NONUM: at 
line 108 was performed and execution continued outputting the 
next byte. If sixteen bytes had been printed (i.e., the low four 
bits of register [L] = OOOOB) , then a new address was printed on 
a new line and the process continued. We need to also test for 
eight bits printed, so we'll continue to test for the low four bits 
being 0, but this time we'll branch to the new address code if it 
is zero, rather than branching over the new address code if it is 
not. We'll then put our test for the eighth hyte printed immedi- 
ately after that test and if so, perform our own line break. If 
not, we'll simply proceed to NONUM: as normal. The pro- 
gram flow is as follows. 

1. JZ SKIP The instruction before this leaves the low four 
bits of [L] in [A] and affects the zero flag based on their con- 
tents. 'This op-code then caxises a jump to SKIP: (line 94) if 
the zero flag is set, meaning we've printed sixteen bytes. 

2. MOV C,A This op-code MOVes the contents of [A] into 
[C] and is done to save them while we use [A] in the next phase. 

3. LDA FLAG Here we load [A] with our forty/eighty-col- 
umn flag. 

4. ORA A We now OR it to affect the zero flag. 

5. JNZ NONUM If the zero flag is not set here, then we 
are in eighty-column mode and therefore should go on to 
NONUM: (line 108) to continue printing all sixteen bytes on a 
single line. 

6. MOV A,C If we get here, then we are in forty-column 



mode and must apply our eight-bytes-printed test. This op-codc 
moves the contents of [C] into [A], putting the original value i 
back. 

7. CPI 08H This instruction, meaning ComPare Immedi- 
ate the contents of [A] with the value following (eight in this 
case), essentially subtracts eight from [A], affecting the zero 
flag; but, unlike SUI, does not store the result in [A], thereby 
preserving it. Since [A] still contains the low four bits of [L] and 
is a count of the number of bytes printed, the zero flag will be 
set if we have printed eight. 

8. JNZ NONUM If the zero flag is not set, then we need to 
continue printing, and so should jump to NONUM: (line 108). 

9. CALL CRLF If we are here, then we have printed eight 
bytes and need to output a CRLF sequence. This instruction 
will cause a jump to the label CRLF: (line 143) , but also put the 
address following it on the stack so that when the CRLF rou- 
tine finishes, the RETurn instruction will cause us to continue 
at instruction ten below (line 85) . 

10. PUSH H This op-code causes the contents of [HL] to be 
placed on the stack, saving the address, while we use [HL]. 

11. MVI L,5 This MoVe Immediate instruction places a 
value of 5 in [L] as a counter for printing five spaces, to line up 
the second eight bytes with the first, i.e., past the address and 
colon. 

12. MVI A,' ' This instruction at label PRSPC: moves the 
value of an ASCII space (the character between the quotes) 
into [A] so that we can print it. 

13. CALL PCHAR This instruction calls the PCHAR: sub- 
routine (line 135) that prints the character in [A] and returns. 

14. DCR L This op-code DeCRements the contents of [L] re- 
ducing the space counter by one and sets the zero flag if 0. 

15. JNZ PRSPC If the counter's nonzero, we jump to 
PRSPC: (line 87) and continue printing spaces. 

16. POP H This op-code retrieves the original contents of 
[HL] now that we are through using [L] as a counter. 

17. JMP NONUM Since we are now ready to continue 
printing the remainder of the sixteen bytes (having finished 
breaking the line) , this instruction causes a jump to NONUM: 
(line 108) , skipping the code which prints a new address (at la- 
bel SKIP:). 

This completes the modifications for oior first functional 
change and the program will now deal with a forty-column en- 
vironment. Our next step will be to Install the change that 
prints the colon after the address. This is done with two in- 
structions at lines 106 and 107 as follows: 

1. MVI A,':' This instruction does a MoVe Immediate of 
the ASCII value for colon into [A]. 

2. CALL PCHAR This is a call to the print-character sub- 
routine that prints the value in [A] to the screen. 

These two instructions are inserted at the end of the print 
address code so that each time the address is printed, they too 
will be executed. 

Our final functional change involves printing two blank 
lines after the printing of each 128 bytes. To do this we will 
have to install code to test the address low-order hyie to see if it 
is 00 or 80H, since this byte increments from 00 to 7FH for the 
first 128 bytes and from 80H to OFFH for the second. If we are 
at a 128-byte boundary, we will do two CRLF sequences prior 
to printing the normal CRLF and the address. The easiest 
place to implement the test is at the subroutine CRLF: that 
prints the CRLF sequence at the end of each line. The test com- 
prises five new instructions that are placed ahead of the nor- 
mal CRLF: code at lines 143 through 147. We will leave the 
CRLF: label in front of the test so that it is executed every time 
the subroutine is called and will create a new label CRLFl : at 
the old code so that we can call it ourselves from within our 
new code. The instructions are as follows: 

1. MOV A,L This op-code MOVes the contents of [L] (the 
low order address byte) into [A] so we can test its value. 

2. ORA A This op-code is performed this time not to set the 
zero flag, but to clear the carry flag to 0, which it always does. 
This is to prepare for the next instruction. 

3. RAL This op-code has the effect of shifting every bit in 
[A] 1 position left. The leftmost bit goes into the carry flag and 



JUNE 1982 



63 



the contents of the carry flag go into the rightmost bit of [A]. 
The effect here is that if the value in [A] is either 80H or 00, this 
will produce 00 in [A]. This is due to the fact that since OOH is 
OOOOOOOOB and 80H is lOOOOOOOB, shifting one bit left will pro- 
duce OOOOOOOOB, providing the carry flag was 0 when the shift 
was done. Now the reason for the OR A earlier to zero the car- 
ry flag becomes clear. 

4. ORA A This op-code will now set the zero flag if [A] con- 
tains 00, meaning that [A] was originally 00 or 80H. Any other 
value would have left (1) bits in [A] after the rotate. 

5. JZ P2 This instruction causes a jump to P2 : (line 156) to 
print the extra CRLFs, if the zero bit is set. If not, execution 
continues at CRLFl: immediately after this instruction to 
print a single CRLF as it did before. 

This completes the test and the only modification remain- 
ing is the addition of code to print the extra two CRLFs. Since 
the old CRLF code was a subroutine called by the main pro- 
gram, the RET op-code at the end of it caused program control 
to return to the main program when the CRLF was printed. 
Now our new test code checks for whether one or three CRLFs 
need to be printed. If one, the old CRLF code is executed just 
like it used to be. If three, then we need to execute this code 
three times. We do this by treating the old CRLF code as a sub- 
routine of our new code. This is done with three instructions at 
lines 156, 157, and 158 by simply calling the old CRLF code 
(now CRLFl : ) twice for the extra CRLFs and then Anally do- 
ing a jump to that same code to print the normal CRLF. The 
last instruction is a jump so that the RET at the end of CRLFl : 
will return to the main program instead of our P2: subroutine. 
The same thing could have been done by calling the code three 
times and putting a RET at the end of P2 : , but this would have 
taken an extra byte. 

Now that all modifications have been made, we are ready 
to run the source file through ASM and create our HEX and 
PRN files. The command structure for ASM is very simple and 
easy to use. There are only two forms of the command: 

ASM filename, or 

ASM filename. parms, where parms are the assembly pa- 
rameters. 



The first form will assemble a file on the logged drive of the 
name filename. ASM and create two tiles, filename. HEX and 
filename. PRN. The .HEX file is the object code in a special 
structure called Intel hex format. It is this file that is later used 
with LOAD to create the actual object code in a .COM file. The 
.PRN file is a listing file containing the source code, the ad- 
dresses, and object code, as well as error codes for lines that 
generate errors. Note that you cannot assemble a file that does 
not have a .ASM file extension, since any other extension you 
place after the filename will be treated as parameters. 

The parameters allowed with ASM.COM are also very sim- 
ple. These three characters represent the parameters for the 
source file, the .HEX file, and the .PRN file in that order. They 
can be drive designators (for SoftCard CP/M these are Umited 
to A through F) , in which case they are the drive to get the 
source file from and the drive to write the .HEX and .PRN flies 
to, respectively. In the case of the .HEX file. It can also be the 
letter Z which will cause the .HEX file not to be generated. 
There are two special characters for the .PRN file — Z, which 
suppresses the .PRN file the same as it does for the .HEX file, 
and X which causes the .PRN file to be sent to the terminal 
rather than to a disk file. You should note that the ASM com- 
mand scanner will read parameters until it encounters a 
space, at which time it will assume it has them all. For this 
reason the parameters AZ will process normally — source file 
taken from A:, .HEX file suppressed, and .PRN file on the 
logged drive. A Z, however, will take the source from A: but 
will not suppress the .PRN file. This is because it never saw the 
Z, due to the space between it and the A. 

Errors during assembly resiilt in a single-letter error code 
and in the line containing the error being printed on the 
screen. These error codes are listed on pages 3-114 and 3-115 of 
the SoftCard manual, with the exception of the error code S, 
which was left out of both Microsoft's documentation and early 
Digital Research ASM manuals as well. The S means sjTitax 
error and results from misspelled op-codes, MVO instead of 
MOV, for instance, or from bad characters in the source file. 

Once you have assembled the DUMP. ASM program, you 
can now use LOAD.COM to convert the DUMP. HEX file to an 



mm or ptjObos

LOAD DUMP. Note that there must be a DUMP. HEX file on 
the logged disk or you must preface the name DUMP by the 
drive letter that the file is on, as in LOAD B:DUMP. Once 
LOAD has finished saving the new .COM file, try running it. 
The format for DUMP is: DUMP filename. ext 

If you encounter problems, go back and check your work 
against the listing in this column and reassemble. Remember, 
just because there are no errors during assembly is no gfuar- 
antee the program will do what you want.

FORTHE APPLE 



Learn How to Operate the 
Apple II Plus on your own 
computer ... at your own 
convenience . . . with 
this easy-to-use, audio 
mini-course. 

Imagine having a personal tutor 
"talk you through" the practical 
operations of an Apple II Plus 
computer. In just 3 "hands on" 
training sessions of one or two 
hours each, you'll learn how to: 

• Use each special key and 
essential command 

• Load and run programs 

• Save programs and data 

• Copy programs and diskettes 

• Protect programs 

• Modify programs 

• Use your computer as a super 
calculator 

• And much more! 

No Programming Required. You 

don't need to be a programmer to 
operate a computer, any more than 
you need to know how to design a 
car to drive one. 

Our purpose is to put you in the 
driver's seat of your Apple computer 
so that you can confidently use exist- 
ing programs . . . enter your own data 
. . . organize your files . . . and pro- 
tect them. If you later decide to take 
up programming, you'll have the 
necessary background for doing so. 

Teach Yourself. Train Otiiers. 

How to Operate the Apple II Plus is 
designed for the first-time computer 
user. No technical knowledge is 
assumed. Perfect for training others: 
Staff . . . colleagues . . . clients . . . 
customers . . . students . . . family. 
Use it again and again. 

Wliy Audio Instruction? Simple. 
It's human. It's interactive. It's multi- 
sensory. It's patient. It's inexpensive. 
And it works! 

FlipTrack® Training Tapes deliver 
carefully sequenced instruction in a 
relaxed, conversational manner. You 
concentrate on the screen and key- 
board, not a book. You learn at your 
own pace, trying every command and 
observing the results. 



The FlipTrack® Difference. Best of 
all, our patented FlipTrack® cassette 
format can adjust 
to a variety of 
special inter- 
ests and con- 
figurations. 
Optional in- 
struction is 
available at a 
flip of the tape 
for users 




with color 
video, a 
printer, a 
second disk 

drive, or game controllers. 

You save time and avoid confusion 
by learning just the procedures that 
relate to your system, or listening to 
just the topics that interest you. With 
FlipTrack® Training Tapes, you choose 
whether to follow a "full" track or a

Six months ago we started this column with a detailed look 
at what goes on "under the hood" of an Apple II. For the most 
part, you had to accept this description on faith unless you are 
one of the few who thoroughly understands the Apple's sche- 
matic diagrams and firmware listings. 

This month we will delve a little deeper into what makes the 
Apple tick. To aid in our investigation, we will present two 
hardware devices that can be used to strip away some of the 
mystery behind the computer. One of these devices is known as 
the Applethrottle. The complete schematic is included here for 
those who may wish to build their own. 

The Applethrottle can be used to slow down or stop the oper- 
ation of the cpu. This makes it possible to watch the computer 
work in slow motion. What normally takes place in the wink of 
an eye can now be examined in all of its detail. 

To enable us to watch even closer, we can add a display 
board such as the one available from John Bell Engineering. 
This board contains a series of lamps that constantly monitor 
the address and data buses. By slowing the computer down to 
almost a standstill, we can actually watch the cpu executing a 
program — fetching instructions, loading and storing data, per- 
forming branches and jumps, and so on. Even experienced 
hardware and software experts are sure to find this quite in- 



teresting. 

Whoa . . . Apple ! Since the Apple is constantly performing 
between two hundred thousand and five hundred thousand op- 
erations per second, it is normally impossible to watch how the 
computer functions. It is possible, however, to build a device 
which will slow down the computer to a human pace. This is 
done by controlling the ReaDY line of the 6502. When this line is 
brought low, the cpu will halt after it finishes its current read 
or write operation. It will then just sit there and wait until the 
RDY line goes high again. This capability of a microprocessor 
is generally used when the cpu is connected to slow memory 
devices. On the Apple II, this signal is normally held high. Al- 
though the RDY line is available on all of the I/O slots, it is 
very rarely used by other peripheral boards. We can use it, 
however, to build a handy tool for understanding how the com- 
puter works. 

Figure 1 shows the schematic diagfram of the Apple- 
throttle. At the top are two blocks labelled Ul and U2. These 
blocks represent two ICs which are known as 555 timer chips. 
Although Ul and U2 are both 555s, they are connected in slight- 
ly different ways to perform different functions. Ul is con- 
figured as an oscillator; that is, it puts out a continuous stream 
of pulses.

Figure 2. 

Possible waveforms at the output of U2. Overall ob- 
served speed of the computer depends upon the duty cy- 
cle of this signal which is the ratio of on -time to off- 
time. 



The frequency of these pulses (how many per second) is de- 
termined by the external resistance of paddle 1. The output of 
Ul (at pin 3) is fed into U2 which is set up as a "one-shot" mon- 
ostable circuit. This means that for every pulse coming in from 
Ul, U2 will put out a pulse of its own. 

The width of this pulse is variable and depends upon the set- 
ting of paddle 0. Furthermore, there is another signal coming 
into U2 at its reset pin. Whenever this signal is low it forces 
the output of U2 low. When the Applethrottle is engaged, the 
output of U2 will control the state of the Apple's cpu. When U2 
is high, the cpu will run at full speed. When U2 is low, the cpu 
will stop. 

The overall observed speed of the computer will depend up- 
on how often the cpu is running versus how often it is stopped. 
Figure 2 shows how the various controls affect the waveform 
at U2's output and thus the computer's operation. The ratio of 
on to off time is known as the duty cycle of the waveform. Al- 
though both paddles can be used to vary the speed over a wide 
range, paddle 0 can be replaced by a fixed resistor for simpler 
operation. 

On/off control of the Applethrottle is taken care of by U3 
and U4 which provide a collection of NAND gates. To follow 
the logic of this circuit, remember that both inputs of a NAND 
gate must be high for its output to go low. Two of these gates 
(the ones on the right) are cross connected to form an RS (Re- 
set/Set) latch. The output at U4 pin 6 will go low when the in- 
put at U4 pin 1 goes low. The output will then remain low until a 
low signal is sent into U4 pin 5. The inputs to this latch are 
basically derived from the two push-button inputs. Therefore, 
pressing the button on paddle 1 will engage the slow motion 
mode, while pressing the button on paddle 0 will restore nor- 
mal speed operation. 

Two other signals are worth mentioning. The reset signal 
from the Apple bus is also fed into the control circuit to make 
sure that the Applethrottle is turned off whenever a reset is 
performed. Another output from the slow switch (button 
1) is fed into U2. This causes the cpu to halt whenever button 1 
is held down. R2 is a pull-down resistor to ensure that the 
Applethrottle is turned off when no paddles are connected. 

Unfortunately, the output of U2 cannot be fed directly onto 
the Apple's bus because of a timing requirement of the 6502. 
The specifications of this cpu require that the RDY signal 
change only during the phase one clock time. This means that 
the pulses coming out of U2 must be synchronized with the 
Apple's system clock. This is the job of U5, which consists of 
two D-type flip-flops. The first section is used to control the out- 
put to the cpu via the preset signal (pin 10) . When this pin is 



high, it allows the variable pulse signal from U2 to pass 
through to the cpu. When the pin goes low (notice the small cir- 
cle at pin 10 indicating that this is an active low input) , the pre- 
set action causes the output to remain high regardless of the 
variable pulse signal. This allows the computer to operate in a 
normal fashion, that is, at full speed. The second half of U5 
clocks the final output to the Apple bus at the trailing edge of 
the phase zero clock. This satisfies the timing requirements of 
the 6502. Finally, the ReaDY output is connected through a di- 
ode to present only an active low signal. This is necessary so 
that other boards connected to the bus can pull the RDY line 
low. 

Building an Applethrottle. You can build your own Apple- 
throttle using the schematic in figure 1. Start with a blank 
"prototyping board," available from Apple and other sources. 
Install the various components and connect them using point- 
to-point wiring. It is highly recommended that you use sockets 
for all of the ICs. For simpler operation, start with the fixed re- 
sistor in place of paddle 0. Of course, if you've never picked up 
a soldering iron before, you may wish to purchase an as- 
sembled unit from the manufacturer. 

Initial Checkout. The Applethrottle requires a set of game 
paddles for its operation. These paddles plug directly into a 
socket on the Applethrottle. If you want to slow down games or 
other programs that also use paddles, you will need another set 
of paddles to plug into the Apple game I/O socket. After con- 
necting the paddles to the Applethrottle, turn off the computer 
and remove the cover. The Applethrottle can now be inserted 
into any slot. Slot 7 is recommended since it is most likely to be 
empty and because it will allow the paddles to be easily 
changed from the same I/O connector to the Applethrottle. 
Dress the cable through one of the rear cutouts and then re- 
place the cover. 

Turn on the computer and type call —151 if necessary to get 
into the Apple Monitor. If the computer seems dead or does not 
operate properly when it is turned on, remove the Apple-

throttle and check for any construction mlstakeB, solder 
shorts, bad connections, and so on. After getting Into the Mon- 
itor you can check normal operation of the computer by tjrping 
EOOOL and viewing the disassembled listing. Ji your paddles 
are not labeled, identify paddle 1 as follows: 

While holding down the push button on one paddle, hit the 
reset key. If the computer beeps as usual, repeat using the 
other push button. The button which prevents a normal reset is 
button 1. This button can be labeled "slow/stop." Momentar- 
ily press the other button to restore normal operation (this but- 
ton can be labeled "normal"). 

Next rotate paddle 1 to Its midrange position and momen- 
tarily press button 1. Type L and hit retiom. Note that the list- 
ing is now slower and its speed can be varied by the paddle set- 
ting. The listing can also be stopped at any time by pressing, 
and holding, button 1. Press button 0 to restore normal speed 
operation. 

Using the Applethrottle. The Applethrottle can be operated 
at any time to slow down or stop the computer. When engaged, 
all computer functions except memory refresh and video gen- 
eration are affected. Thus the Applethrottle can be used in ma- 
chine language, Basic, Pascal, and so on. It may be called up- 
on during the list, trace, or run of any program. At slow 
speeds, the video display produces a rolling effect each time a 
new line of text is printed. This provides a perfect example of 
how the Applethrottle can be used to probe the workings of the 
computer. 

When the Apple is listing out a long program, it appears as 
if it is scanning one long sheet of paper from top to bottom. 
New text continually appears at the bottom of the screen while 
the existing lines seem to glide up the screen until they dis- 
appear at the top. This function of the video display Is referred 
to as scrolling and you've probably come to take It for granted. 
But if you stop to think about it, this Is not such a simple task. 
Every time a new line is to be displayed at the bottom of the 
screen, the lowest twenty-three lines must each be moved up 
one line. Due to the Apple's memory-mapped video design, this 



amounts to moving 920 characters (23X40) and calculating 
new base addresses forty-six times. Fortunately, the speedy 
cpu can perform all this in a fraction of a second so we see a 
rather smooth moving display. 

But when the Applethrottle Is turned on, the cpu can be 
slowed down to the point where this ordinary task of scrolling 
now takes several seconds or more to complete. It then be- 
comes obvious what actually happens every time a new line Is 
printed. Watching in slow motion, you can see the cpu rewrit- 
ing each line, one at a time, from the top of the screen down. 
Since the information on the top line Is no longer needed, it Is 
replaced by the characters on the second line. The text from 
the third line is then copied onto the second line and so on. It Is 
also interesting to note that the copying Is done from right to 
left. This process continues until the bottom line is reached. 
This line is then changed to all blanks to erase the previous in- 
formation. Finally the new text is printed at the bottom of the 
screen. 

After watching the cpu perform this operation, you should 
have a good g^rasp of what is involved in printing text to the 
screen. If you have a working knowledge of assembly lan- 
guage, or especially if you're trjring to develop such skill, you 
can now look at the software routine that actually is responsi- 
ble for what you saw. The scroll routine can be found at loca- 
tion $FC70 in the Apple's Monitor. It Is actually part of the com- 
plete video out routine, VIDOUT, which begins at location 
$FBFD. Taking this back one more step, we find that VID- 
OUT is usually called by the Apple's character output routine, 
COUT at $FDED. Study the Apple Monitor listing to see If you 
can follow the assembly language routine that scrolls the 
screen. By understanding the software and being able to fol- 
low It through In slow motion, you can begin to gain a better un- 
derstanding of how the Apple works. 

One of the best features of the Applethrottle is that it re- 
quires no software and can be activated or deactivated at any 
time. Therefore Its uses are almost limitless. You can use it to 
slow down or stop Applesoft program listings (no more typing 
speed= over and over again) . Of course, it also does the same 
for Integer Basic and even gives you stoplist without the Auto- 
start ROM. By adding a toggle switch in parallel with button 1, 
you can also have a "freeze" control. This would be great when 
you're playing a game and get interrupted. Just flip the switch 
and put the computer on hold while you take care of other 
things. Some games have such a feature built Into their pro- 
gram, but this technique will work for any program. 

Speaking of games, have you ever wondered how a partic- 
ular program produces those spectacular graphics on the hi- 
res screen? Well, pop on the Applethrottle and watch the 
figures being drawn In slow motion. The ultimate gaming use 
for the Applethrottle is to slow down reaction-type games, 
making them much easier to play. This has accounted for at 
least one unbelievable score In Snogglel No doubt you will 
come up with many more uses for the Applethrottle. 

Because the Applethrottle slows down the overall oper- 
ation of the computer, certain time-sensitive operations will 
not work properly with the throttle engaged. Specifically, cas- 
sette and disk I/O should not be performed when the Apple- 
throttle is on. No harm will be done but an error message will 
(eventually) be printed. Other real-time software routines 
such as a serial printer driver (including the Apple High-Speed 
Serial Interface Card, for example) may not function at sub- 
normal speeds. Thus you should return the computer to nor- 
mal speed before any of these operations are performed. 

Another problem can arise when the Applethrottle is set for 
very slow speed and you are typing at the keyboard. Since the 
keyboard input routine is slowed down along with everjrthing 
else. It Is very easy to type too fast, causing the computer to 
miss one or more keystrokes. To avoid this, you may wish to 
return to normal speed, enter from the keyboard, and then re- 
activate the Applethrottle before hitting return. Remember, 
the Applethrottle will always disengage whenever the reset 
key Is pressed or if there are no paddles connected to It.

even deeper into the internal workings of the Apple can be ac- 
complished with the display board from John Bell Engineer- 
ing. This board contains sixteen LEDs to monitor the address 
bus and eight more for the data bus. These give a constant 
readout on what information is present on their respective 
buses. The board also has a three-position switch which can 
start, stop, or single-step the cpu. Under normal operation the 
LEDs flash on and off so rapidly that they appear to be on all 
the time. But when slowed down or stopped by the switch on 
the display board, they begin to reveal the true nature of how 
data is transferred on the buses. 

Before going any further, we must point out that our evalu- 
ation board required two modifications to make it work. It 
seems that the original design of this board contained a couple 
of major flaws. Nevertheless, it turns out that both problems 
can be easily solved with a few simple wiring changes and the 
addition of one diode. The first correction involves the opera- 
tion of the run/stop switch. Originally this switch was al- 
lowed to control the 6502 RDY line asynchronously, that is, 
without regard for the system clock phase as previously de- 
scribed. This, of course, had the disastrous effect that half the 
time the switch was operated the computer would hang up. 
Fortunately, by moving the switch signal to a different input 
of the same IC, we can make it act synchronously. The other 
problem was that the RDY output from the display board 
came directly from a TTL logic device. This does not comply 
with the Apple bus requirements that this signal be driven by an 
open collector or active low circuit. This means that any given 
peripheral board can pull the line low when needed, but should 
otherwise not interfere with the signal. The display board's 
TTL signal with its active high would prevent other boards 
from controlling the RDY line. Again the fix is simple — add a 
diode in series with the control line. These changes are shown 
in figure 3. 

The manufacturer stated that the boards currently being 
sold have these corrections. For those of you that may have an 
older board (and probably couldn't figure out why it didn't 
work) we suggest you perform the following modifications. Be- 
sides the ability to solder, all you need is one small signal di- 
ode {1N914 variety) , a sharp knife, and some small gauge wire 
such as is used for wire-wrapping. 

1. Start by cutting two traces. The first is on the component 
side of the board and starts at the right side of R28, going down- 
ward toward and under IC6. Using an Exacto knife or similar 
tool, cut this trace cleanly so that there is no longer any con- 
nection. The other trace to be cut is on the back side of the 
board. It is the short one between pins 10 and 12 of IC6. 

2. Using some small gauge wire, connect pins 4 and 12 of 
IC6. Then connect pin 10 to the right side (the left side when

looking from the back) of R28 that was isolated in the previous 
step. 

3. To add the diode, locate the trace that goes to pin 21 of the 
edge connector. Follow it up to where it meets a hole in the 
board, flip it over, and note that this trace continues to pin 5 of 
IC6. Somewhere between the hole and pin 5, cut the trace. Then 
connect the diode to the same two points ; the cathode goes to 
pin 5, the anode to the hole. That's it! 

Using the Display Board. As an example of how to use the 
display board, we will step through one of the shortest, yet by 
far the most frequently executed, routines in the Apple Moni- 
tor — ^the keyboard input routine. This routine is located at 
$FD1B and is labeled KEYIN in the Monitor listings. When- 
ever the computer is waiting for you to type something in on 
the keyboard, this routine is being executed over and over 
again. Aside from getting data from the keyboard, this routine 
also performs one other task. It is constantly incrementing a 
two-byte counter in RAM which can be used as a random num- 
ber generator. 

Figure 4 shows the assembly language code for this routine. 
To follow this routine as it is being executed by the 6502, turn 
off the Apple and plug in the display board. Set the switch to 
RUN and then turn on the computer. You do not need to boot 
DOS, so if your drive starts spinning, just hit reset to stop it. 
Now move the switch on the display board to STOP (or use the . 
Applethrottle) . The computer will have stopped somewhere in 
the KEYIN routine. Activate the single-step switch as many 
times as necessary until the address bus shows $FD1B. This is 
the beginning of the routine and the data bus should read $E6, 
which is the contents of that byte in the Monitor ROM. 

As you continue to single step through the program, you 
should get results similar to what's shown in figure 5. After 
pressing the switch twelve times (or possibly fourteen) , you 
should be back to address $FD1B. This sequence will continue 
to loop around unless you press a key on the keyboard. Note 
that the data in location $4E can be anything but that each time 
through the loop it goes up by one. Also note that if you stop 
with address $C000 on the bus, the data LEDs will be arbi-

TASC The Applesof tCompiler. 
It turns your Apple into 
a power tool. 



Step up to speed. TASC, the Applesoft Compiler, 
converts a standard Applesoft BASIC progrann 
into super-fast machine code. By 
increasing program execution speed 
up to 20 times, Microsoft gives 
you a power tool for Applesoft 
BASIC programming. 
Highest capacity available. 
TASC will compile and run 
larger programs than any 
other Applesoft Compiler. As a 
disk-based system, it doesn't 
require the simultaneous pres- 
ence of compiler and program 
in memory. The memory you save 
allows you to compile significantly 
bigger programs. 

Power without bulk. Code expansion of up to 100% 
severely restricts other compilers. TASC's special 
code compression schemes typically limit code 
expansion to only 25%. You'll really appreciate that 
with complex programs or programs that utilize 
Apple's hi-res graphic pages. 
More BASIC power. TASC's powerful new 
commands increase Applesoft BASIC programming 
capability. Chain with COMMON allows compiled 
programs to share variables, so a main menu 

'Applesoft IS a trademark of Apple Computer Inc. 




supports several programs in a 
single runtime environment. 
TASC's True Integer Arithmetic 
and Integer FOR... NEXT 
capabilities maximize the execu- 
tion speed of compiled programs. 
TASC's near total compatibility 

with Applesoft speeds compil- 
ation of existing programs 
with little or no modification. 
What about mistakes? You 
perfect your programs inter- 
actively with Applesoft. If some- 
thing does slip by TASC recovers 
from errors discovered in compilation 
and traps all runtime errors. It even permits 
graceful interruptions during compilation.

trary. If you now type on the keyboard, the ASCII represen- 
tation of each key pressed will appear on the LEDs. The high- 
est-order lamp, D7, will also be lit. This bit is used to flag the 
cpu that a key has been pressed. 

If you take a close look at the results in figure 5, you should 
be able to follow the cpu as it performs its monotonous task. 
With each step, the 6502 puts out the contents of its program 
counter onto the address bus. This indicates where the cpu ex- 
pects to find the next byte of its program. The data at this lo- 
cation is read into the cpu and, assuming it is the first byte of 
an instruction, is interpreted as the op-code for that in- 
struction. In the case of location $FD1B, this data is $E6 which 
is the op-code for the INCrement zero page memory in- 
struction. 

The actual location to be incremented is found in the sec- 
ond byte of the instruction, which is fetched next. At $FD1C 
we read in a $4E, which is the desired location as shown in 
source listing (the $4E shows up in the object code listing in the 
third column ; it is referred to in the source code by the label 
RNDL) . The next address put out by the cpu will be $4E with 
one plus the old contents of this location appearing on the data 
bus. This new value is then written into location $4E and the 
cpu moves on to fetch the next instruction from $FD1D. Here it 
finds a $D0 followed by a $02, which stands for Branch if Not 
Equal (to zero) ahead two bytes. There is only a one in two 
hundred and fifty-six chance that this branch will not be taken. 
Therefore, our sample results show this branch as being taken. 

But wait, you say! The next memory reference is to $FD1F. 
That is the beginning of the next instruction which the cpu has 
just decided to skip past. It turns out that there is a very good 
reason for this mysterious action which brings up one of the 
finer points about the 6502. What you are witnessing is called 
pipelining and it refers to the architecture of a cpu that allows 
it to sort of think ahead. 

In the case of our branch instruction, the 6502 must check 
its internal flags to determine whether or not to perform the 
branch. While it is doing this, it is also possible to put out the 
next sequential address to start reading the next byte of code. 
Therefore, if the 6502 decides that the branch is not to be taken, 
it already has started to execute the next instruction — no 
wasted time here! If on the other hand, the branch is to be 
taken, then the 6502 must calculate the new address to place in 
the program counter. During this time, the next sequential 
byte is again being read. However, this time the byte is ignored 
since the next instruction must now be fetched from the new lo- 
cation. 

Figures 6,7, and 8 illustrate the possible branching actions 
on a cpu cycle-lDy-cycle basis. If you are interested in such de- 
tailed analysis of how the 6502 works, consult the 6500 hard- 
ware and software manuals such as put out by Synertek. They 
are highly technical but they reveal these subtle points about 
the 6502 's operation. In case you think that this is all ac- 
ademic, there are many times when you may have to figure 
out exactly how many machine cycles a particular routine will 
take. Moving a program, even one that is completely relocat- 
able, can have surprising results if relative branches now start

crossing page boundaries for example. Even knowing that a 
branch instruction executes faster if the branch is not taken 
can be useful in writing speed intensive routines. 

Teaming the Applethrottle and Display Board. The dis- 
play board currently being sold still has some trouble in the 
single-stepping mode. One way to get around these problems is 
to use the Applethrottle to slowly step the cpu. This adds the 
convenience of variable speed and remote operation through 
the paddle controls. Unfortunately, even at its slowest setting, 
the Applethrottle allows the computer to execute many in- 
structions per second. The LEDs on the display board still 
flicker too fast to watch. Adding a 22 MFD capacitor across C3 
on the Applethrottle extends its range down to about one in- 
struction per second. Note that this is roughly three hundred 
thousand times slower than normal. At this rate, the scrolling 
operation previously described would take nearly four hours to 
complete. 

By combining the Applethrottle and the display board, 
there are many other secrets that can be discovered. For ex- 
ample, if you see something really interesting in a program 
that you have, it might be nice to examine the code that per- 
forms it. If the program is in machine language, you can use 
the Apple's built-in disassembler to view it. But how do you 
know where to look? You might have some clue as to what the 
code looks like (for example, if it involves the speaker, key- 
board, screen, DOS, and so on, you could look for references to 
their corresponding addresses) , but you would still have to run 
through the entire listing. This might take several passes and 
lots of time, and you still might not locate it. There Is a better 
way however. Just plug in the Applethrottle and display board 
and run the program. When the routine of interest starts exe-

AKIMATIOK Specialist 
GRAPHICS Specialist 
GRAPHICS ^ A?iIMATIOH Designer 



BACKGROUND 

I have been with On-Line Systems for almost two years and have dealt with the entire process 
of graphics development and animation. I would lil^e to share what I have learned with you. 

My experience with programming games has given me insights into how the APPLE wor\s. 
My animation is smooth, and flic\er -free. It's also fast (faster than any graphics package now 
on the market). I can help you ma\e arcade games and educational products that can truly he 
called ''State of the Art". 

If your interest is in color graphics, I'm the one for you. I can offer you twenty-one beautiful 
colors that can paint your screen in seconds. If you've seen the Hi'Res pictures from TIME 
Z07\[£, you've seen my wor\. 

You will find me indispensable in many areas. If you want to create a Hi-Res graphics screen 
on your Apple ■ no problem! I have many different ways of doing so and even coloring it in. 
But have you noticed how boring a screen that stands still is? My true forte shows through 
when you want your screen to come to life. Even Applesoft programmers will he able to use me 
to create arcade style animation in minutes, painlessly. I have over six different \inds of animation 
for you and even save you the bother of creating any shapes or tables I might need. T^ow that 
I've created your background, drawn your spaceships and got them moving, how about collisions! 
How do you \^ow when a missile stri\es a spaceship! A[o problem! I'll let you ]{now. And let's 
not forget my abilities as an educator. Read my documentation and I'll show you things you 
never thought you'd see. 

I also bring with me a large toolbox. I have the editing tools to customize fonts and a zoom lens 
to do precise dot-hy-dot editing. Many of my tools can he used in everyday situations to build 
bar graphs, draw charts or simply doodle on the Hi-Res screen. 

I will wor}{ on the 48K APPLE II/ 11+ with at least one dis\ drive. You can see my wor\ at 
your local computer store, or contact me at OJ^-LITsiE SYSTEMS.

ng, just stop the computer or slow-step it. One glance at the 
jlay board will tell you what address in memory is being 
cuted. This should be close enough for you to find the be- 
ling of the routine later with the disassembler, 
rhe Apple 11 Display Board is available from John Bell En- 
tering for $49.95, assembled. As a kit, the cost is $42.95. The 
e board alone can be purchased for $25.95. 
%pple II Extender Board. Another handy tool for working 
1 Apple hardware is an extender board. This is simply a 
ill board that brings out, or extends, the peripheral con- 
tor inside the computer. This makes it possible to connect 
equipment to various parts of a peripheral board without 
rference from other boards in adjacent slots. It can also be 

1 to raise up the display board for easier viewing, 
^yone who works on complex, modular electronic sys- 
is knows the value of an extender board. The Apple II is no 
eption. Of course, an extender board is only used when ex- 
imenting with or repairing a peripheral card. The extender 
rd pictured sells for $12.95 and is available from John Bell 
jineering. 

Mill Update. Last November we reported on the Pascal 
ed-Up Kit from Stellation Two. This product, in conjunction 
h the Mill 6809 processor board, offered significant speed 
)rovement for Pascal programs. However, we found that 

of our benchmark test programs actually ran slower after 
ailing the speed-up patches. This led to the discovery that 

mathematical functions were still being performed by the 
)le's 6502 instead of the 6809. 

Since that time, we have received an additional package 
ch is referred to as the Floating Point Update for the Speed- 
Kit. This transfers almost all of the computing power over 
le 6809 leaving the 6502 to handle the input/output functions. 
V the full power of the coprocessor can be utilized. Unfor- 
itely, the two processors still alternate control — ^they do not 
rate simultaneously. 

To test the speed improvement, we ran the same bench- 
rk which calculated the squares of 10,000 numbers. The re- 
s from the previous test revealed that this program would 

2 47.8 seconds to complete with standard Apple Pascal, 
ling the speed-up kit increased the time to 54.0 seconds, 
jr installing the floating point patches, however, this pro- 
m ran in 27.8 seconds. That's over 40 percent faster, which 
uite impressive! 

As an interesting aside, we wrote a program in Applesoft to 
omplish the same task. In Applesoft this calculation takes 
ost forty-four seconds. While one of the Applesoft compilers 
Id be used to speed this up, they would not offer much im- 
irement to thiis program since it mostly Involves mathe- 
;ical calculations. All of the Applesoft compilers rely on the 
le 6502 math routines in ROM that are used by the inter- 
ter. Thus the compiled program performs number-crunch- 
at almost the same speed as the noncompiled program, 
[nstalllng the Floating Point Update is quite easy. All the 
essary changes are made by executing one program on the 
AL: diskette. Like the rest of the Speed-Up Kit, the im- 
ved capabilities are immediately available. There is no 
d to change any existing source or code files to make use of 
Speed-Up. Another sample program is also included on the 
I. This program makes extensive use of the floating point 
tines and shows a 51 percent improvement over the un- 
iified Pascal. Speed increases of up to 80 percent have been 
Drted with this package. The Floating Point Upgrade sells 
$35. 

Also just announced for the Mill is the OS-9 operating 
•.em with Basic-09. This should greatly enhance the power 
le Mill while providing a superior operating system for the 
»le II. Watch this column for a complete review of this 
em in the near future.

Richard hach- 



On ^owen 
Apples, and freedom 




bp Melissa hAilich 



He swallowed, knowing that if his wings unfolded at that 
speed he'd be bloivn into a million tiny shreds of seagull. But 
the speed was power and the speed was joy and the speed was 
pure beauty. 

Richard Bach, Jonathan Livingston Seagull 



THE SEA chops and the water swells, and 
the gulls play there as they've always done, 
oblivious to fame and metaphor. Diving for a 
fish, swooping toward the sun, a shriek here 
at a crow there, up again, down again — 
T splash! 

In the holy land of publishing there was once a little book that 
wasn't supposed to make it at all, but instead It made quite a splash. 
Several major conglomerates, none too wisely, had already shaken 
their heads no and sent rejection slips to Its author, a virtual un- 
known named Richard Bach. It was finally published in 1970, and 
then this strange book, whose main character was a talking bird, 
proceeded to break nearly all sales records in publishing history. 

Jonathan Livingston Seagull delivers a simple and empowering 
message that people needed to hear. It is the story of an independent 
seagull who decides to go beyond the ordinary limits and normal 
abilities the feathered and beaked society has dictated, because Jon- 
athan knows he can do it. 

Apparently, people still want to believe in the rebellious seagull. 
Ten years later, a multitude of devoted fans seeking a hero, literary 
scholars seeking a symbol, and disillusioned mystics seeking an an- 
swer are still trying to catch up with Bach because of Jonathan and 



n^/t/i photographs Ma^io McGurk 



because of several of the other books he's recently written. 

The author now lives on a secret Island somewhere in the 
Northern Hemisphere, a postcard type of place where the sea- 
gulls haven't yet become tourist attractions. Some of the local 
islanders say Jonathan actually lives there. Others say Bach is 
a magic man and that he is Jonathan. Still others are trying to 
find out who Bach is, what Bach is, and can Bach really do any- 
thing he wants to do? 

"Richard isn't home," said his wife when she answered the 
telephone one day at their seaside home. "He's out flying." 

Maybe this man can do everything. Was he out there right 
now flapping his arms with his feathered friends over the 
breakers? It was too embarrassing even to ask, but perhaps 
Bach would return the call if he ever came down. 

Richard Bach is a man not easily bound into convention, a 
man who is ready to take off at a moment's notice, either on a 
wild idea or into the wild blue yonder. Flying, whether in an 
airplane or by way of a bird, is a metaphor for freedom and in- 
dependence Bach frequently uses in his writing. 

Grease and cantankerous engines are there too. Nothing by 
Chance, A Gift of Wings, and Illusions: Adventures of a Reluc- 
tant Messiah are all about airplanes some say. Bach is as ethe- 
real and philosophical and metaphysical as any modem-day 
author can be, but he is also fascinated by machines, believing 
they can be a tool to help people attain power. 

It was a combination of this practical and intuitive side that 
lured him into a computer store one day in 1979. It just hap- 
pened to be a computer store where Apples were sold. 

Stormy Seas. "NO! NO APPLE!!" protested his wife, 
Leslie Parrish-Bach. They were living in a small trailer at the 
time, already cramped wall-to-wall with books, plants, and a 
stereo system. "There has got to be a limit." 

"But I knew," said an undaunted Bach, "that behind those 
beautiful blue eyes was a marvelous sense of organization. 
Where I liked the computer for its sort of gadgetry aspect, I 
knew she would like it for its enormous power of organiza- 
tion — of ordering the sea of information that was storming 
about us." 

Five minutes in the store was all it took. 

"Okay, Richard. You can have your computer." It was, Les- 
lie recalled later, so "instantly obvious" what it could do. 

So they shoved things in their trailer off to one side, and 
Leslie sat down in front of the brand new Apple for fourteen 
hours straight the first day. The second day was the same and 
so was the third day and the fourth. ... 

"And Richard never got to play with it," she said. 

"That's right," he said. 



Finally, after moping around for several days, Bach pro- 
posed to his wife: 

"Gee, Leslie, do you think I could buy some computer 

time?" 

Behind her intelligent blue eyes was also a strong sense of 
compassion, so the couple returned to the computer store, 
shoved more things aside in their trailer, and Bach was finally 
able to take off with his own Apple. Jonathan would have been 
proud. 

Life in an Electronic Nutshell. Very swiftly the Bachs real- 
ized that their lives had changed dramatically with those com- 
puters. 

"It feels like being a cyborg, doesn't it?" Richard says, lik- 
ing the idea. "Suddenly you've got these technological append- 
ages that help you know what you want to know and learn the 
things you want to learn." 

But with all the wonderful rainbow of things came the ter- 
ror only a computerist could appreciate. 

"An I/O error." That's all he says and the happy lunch-time 
conversation goes dead. 

"You talk to anybody on the street and you say you've got 
an I/O error and they say who cares? So what?" 

How well the Bachs know I/O errors, and they have a 
beaut of a story that should go down in the I/O error hall of 
fame. 

It happened on a deadline, of course, as they always do. The 
Bachs were intensely involved in a struggle with the Bureau of 
Land Management, which was trying to cut down a forest of 
trees in a wilderness area. The environmentalists were charg- 
ing that the proposed project was illegal. The BLM said prove 
it. They had thirty days. 

With the Bachs on their side, the environmentalists dug up 
every bit of forestry information out there : rules and reg^ula- 
tions governing the protection of wildlands ; scientific surveys 
documenting the trees in forests the BLM had previously 
sheared that had never regrown; as well as legal precedents in 
case they had to go to court. 

The computers at this time proved an invaluable weapon 
for the cause. The Bachs were storing and organizing all their 
information and evidence on a database. They were able to 
contact a computerized information search service and get 
more facts and figures than they abready had. Then they were 
able to compile all this into readable copy using the Apple 
Writer word processor. 

But in the heat of the night, about a week before the federal 
government's imposed deadline, their faithful computer went 
input kaput I and the Bachs were faced with that all-too-famil- 



More power, speed, and flexibility for the money than any

Poems Are Made by Fools on Computers. Give up? 
Never! ! ! The Bachs probably cried a little, and then perhaps 
Richard took a walk and pondered the meaning of life. But 
they got back in their chairs, and then, side by side, for a week 
straight, twenty-two hours a day, going to bed at three a.m., 
waking up at five a.m., the Bachs redid what had been lost, 
met their deadline, and so far, a small group of people have 




kept the Bureau of Land Management from chopping down the 
trees in that forest. 

Still to this day there is some confusion about what happen- 
ed to their computer that dark and stormy night, and they 
strongly doubt a BLM agent pulled the plug. Although they still 
have a way to go in this battle, the environmentalists are re- 
ceiving some respectful attention from a few state officials 
who are finally beginning to understand their side— that the 
trees won't grow back. 

"We want to try to communicate that to them and work it 
out in a reasonable way before we have to get involved in some 
major confrontation," said Leslie. "We have literally thou- 
sands of pages of legal documents showing the forests won't 
grow back for at least three hundred years. And we want to ap- 
peal to them first as reasonable human beings." 

Without the computers, the environmentalists would have 
never been able to compile the documentation so quickly and 
organize it so well. Even now after moving far, far away from 
that forest, the Bachs can still keep in touch with their conser- 
vationist friends by modem. 

And that is why this couple, who are so down-to-earth con- 
cerned with the land, are so taken with a hunk of plastic and 
electrical cords and metal chips. It is, they say, a way to bring 
information and power and other abilities that were once 
strictly the domain of large corporations and big money into 



the hands of individuals who can use them intelligently. 

The electronic connection— this is something people dream 
about and intuitively seek, said Bach. 

"I want to be connected to a network of people around the 
world who share my thoughts and ideas. I want to be able to, at 
any hour of the night or day, write some kind of communi- 
cation or respond to some kind of idea that's come in on that 
special humming, silver web that stretches between us elec- 
tronically." 

The future hummed 
and glowed with promise. 

—J.L.S. 

At that point in the book, Jonathan Seagull had really 
learned to fly: the loop, the slow roll, the inverted spin, the gull 
bunt, the pinwheel. Likewise, Apple computer showed people 
that we can tie their computers into a modem, "and sure 
enough," said Bach, "networks began springing up like spider 
webs in a haunted house. 

"It's a delightfully haunted place this whole country is slow- 
ly becoming with these lines being cast one to another. That is 
an intensely magnetic element that is appealing to a great 
many of us." 

The portion of the population without computers is net- 
working now with telephones, said Bach. He cited The 
Aquarian Conspiracy by Marilyn Ferguson, a kind of bible 
for new age thinkers which highlights the networking taking 
place among those interested in social change. Mlcrocomput- 
erists are coming into contact through The Source, Micronet, 
the Sourdough Network in Alaska, and all the other bulletin 
boards and networks in this country. 

"As all these bits of information come together, you see the 
power we the people have," noted Leslie. "The computer links 
us together." 

Bach said he would like to live in a society where people are 
pursuing the things they most want to do, and he doesn't mean 
this as a vague, philosophical discourse. He is talking about 
computer programming, aircraft mechanics, writing books, 
starting a business; each person has a special dream buried 
somewhere, maybe since childhood, and probably it's about 
time for that dream to be realized. 

"Are you doing right now what you really want to do more 
than anything else in the world? If your answer is no, stop 
doing it, and hurl yourself into what you most want to do." 

But what about money, Mr. Jonathan Livingston Seagull 
Bach? 

Somewhere, right now, tied to a dock, is a beautiful little 
boat waiting for a person who loves the sea. And even if you 
haven't a cent in the world. Bach said, you can still go to that 
dock and pick out the boat you most want to sail or own. 

"So you say to whomever is around there, 'Do you mind if I 
just stand here and look at this beautiful ship?' And that per- 
son, if they have anything to do with boats, and they do be- 
cause they've been brought there by that same kind of love, 
will see, without knowing it, themselves in you. 'Svire, go ahead 
and look,' they say. 

"But you're back the next day and you say, 'Would it be all 
right, and I'm not asking any pay at all, if I could just polish 
some of this brass. I see a little ojddation, but it's such a beau- 
tiful little boat, and I won't charge you a thing. I just want to 
touch it.' 

"And the owner of the boat, or whomever, thinks you're 
some kind of nut, and tells you to get lost. 

"But you're back the next day, and you've brought your 
own rag, and you ask if you could just wipe the saltwater off a 
rail. And after demonstrating an attitude, a love for this boat 
which is something in common, you've created a bridge and 
then they'll say: 'If you're going to hang around here, here's a 
chamois, and all right, do all the teak, and I'll buy you Ivinch.' 

"And you get to know this person a little bit, and you're 
back the next day and you have hurled yourself into the area of 
your love— the area that then comes towards you. The boat

TheNewAIO-H. 

Another winner from the folks who invented 
multi-function Apfde interfaces. 



SSM is still ahead of the game 
when it comes to the Apple IIJ*^ 
Choose from any of four operating 
modes. And you're assured of flexi- 
bility at a price that spells big 
savings. 

Check out why SSM spells 
success: 

THE NEW SERIAL/PARAL- 
LEL AIO-II: this new fuU-function 
serial and parallel interface for the 
Apple II gives you true simulta- 
neous operation. It's totally trans- 
parent to the user; there's no soft- 
ware to write, and no need to 
modify your computer. Advanced 
design techniques overcome the 
need for "phantom" slot assign- 
ments and related software com- 
patibility concerns. 

The AIO-II™ appears to applica- 
tion software as either an Apple 
communications card or paraUel 
printer card. You don't have to 
worry about special setup require- 
ments. Hassle-free, user-oriented 
AIO-II design permits easy selec- 
tion of four functions: serial modem, 
serial terminal/printer, parallel Cen- 
tronics printer, and general-purpose 



parallel. On-board firmware provides 
all necessary drivers in a single 
package. Optional cables support 
Centronics-compatible printers and 
others. 

You can remain in the game, too, 
with either our Serial ASIO™ or 
Parallel APIO™ boards-if low 
cost, single function's your style. 
Our ASIO connects your Apple to 
a modem with an optional terminal 
routine, or to a terminal/printer 
without modifying the cable. It 




gives you standard RS-232 interface 
with complete handshaking. And 
selectable rates from 110 to 9600 
baud. The APIO parallel interface 
supports general-purpose I/O and 
all popular Centronics-compatible 
printers, including Epson, IDS, 
Okidata, Anadex, and others. 

All our game-winning boards are 
designed to make your Apple more 
productive. Optional software sup- 
port is available for Apple Pascal 
and Microsoft CPIM™ 

Whether you're an OEM or end 
user, we can deliver any quantity 
you specify. Fast. For the latest 
word on any of these interface 
boards, or our newly enhanced 
A488™ (the industry's highest per- 
formance IEEE-488 controller), see 
your local dealer, or caU us today.

reaches out to take you, till the time comes when they say, 
'Well, we're shipping out to Papeete,' so you offer to help in any 
way you can, and then you find yourself in the middle of the 
South Pacific, surrounded by the ocean you love. But you have 
to take that difficult first step. 

"The most difficult thing we'll ever have to do is find that 
love," said Bach. "But find it, and the rest will be difficult and 
very happy. Find what you want to do more than anything, and 
all you have to do is hurl yourself towards it." 



All of us know this but have learned to ignore our yearn- 
ings, according to Bach. Very few children in the school 
system say they want to grow up and lead a meaningless life. A 
child's future is usually brimming with all kinds of exciting 
plans. But it is impressed upon them, against their intuition, 
that ail-too familiar warning: "You can't always do what you 
want to do." 

"It's a lie," said Bach. "You can always do what you want 
to do, but you hear just the opposite over and over and over and 
over until you are hypnotized. Isn't that what hypnotism is? 

"We can get de-hypnotized. Just ask yourself that utterly 
simple question : What do I want to be doing? and stop ignor- 
ing the answer." 

Everything and nothing will then get in the way. In Bach's 
early days of aviation, when he wanted to be flying his own air- 
plane more than anything else, his problem was money. So he 
had the bill collectors repossess his car instead of his biplane. 
Bach's case was unusual though; it is usually fear and not fi- 
nances that is the major roadblock on the way to a dream. 

"If you're frightened of the unknown, there is something so 
deliciously satisfjring in what is familiar. Even though it's 
boredom, even though it's as dull as slate, a good number of 
people would rather be able to count on that than take a chance 
on something different." 

Bach told the story of a woman he once met who complain- 
ed bitterly about her life in the Bronx — how she couldn't stand 
the muggings, the murders, and the fear of going out at night. 
So he suggested she move, someplace like rural Wyoming, 
where she would have the wind and the sky instead of the smog 
and the dark, dangerous alleys. 

The woman pondered this at length, and then finally an- 
swered something to the effect that: "I'm more afraid of what 
I don't know than I hate what I do know." 

"It's that fear of the unknown — and that woman put her fin-

Mind Your 
Busines 

BV PETEk OLIYIERI 





Aren't you glad June is here? Of course, those of us who 
have suffered through a long, cold winter are probably some- 
what biased in favor of the summer season. 

If you've been around awhile, you may recognize the sig- 
nificance the month of June holds for me. It marks my first an- 
niversary with Softalk — yes, I've been Minding Your Business 
for a year now. No cards or letters, please. Just keep reading. 

The Marathon. If you attended the West Ctoast Computer 
Faire in San Francisco in March, or have attended a similar 
event during your tenure as an Apple owner, you were prob- 
ably struck (and perhaps a bit overwhelmed) by the number 
and variety of products available to you. It can be very diffi- 
cult to sort out all the different options, packages, and attach- 
ments that can fit your Apple, especially after having 
wandered through an exhibit hall that's overflowing with possi- 
bilities. New users — people who are contemplating a small 
business system or a home computer set-up — may find them- 
selves in a particularly difficult position as they attempt to sort 
out all the options and keep track of all the products available 
to them. If these folks were computers, surely they would suf- 
fer from a system-overload error message at a show such as 
this one. 

It is wonderful indeed that so much is available to present 
and prospective Apple owners, but it also means that new 
microcomputer enthusiasts face an avalanche of information 
that they may not have the skill/experience to digest, evalu- 
ate, and interpret. One function of this column in the months to 
come will be as a vehicle for organizing and explaining some of 
this material. 

Business User Group. Happily, many of you have sent notes 
expressing your interest in our Business User Group (. . . do 
you realize that the acronym for this group is BUG. . .? oh 
well) . Judging from the letters received so far, we are on our 
way to establishing an information exchange that should prove 
very worthwhile. 

Gary Griffis of Concord, Massachusetts writes in about 
some freelance consulting he's been doing with small busi- 
nesses and savings banks. He'd had several years' experience 
with DEC, so it was not surprising that he was excited about 
acquiring his Apple last October. Since then, he has success- 
fully installed six other Apples in client locations, and has been 
involved in such applications as planning, word processing, 
mailing lists, and a variety of banking applications, including 
safe deposit accounting, loan tracking, and so on. In addition, 
he expects to be involved in networking Apples fairly soon. 

Griffis has shared this information as a means of letting the 
group know about some of his interests and some of his frus- 
trations. His biggest problem concerns evaluating software 
prior to specifying it to a particular client. In trying to select a 
word processor, for example, he found it difficult to get good 
information. He purchased the Executive Secretary, but now 
feels that this was a mistake. On the other hand, he is quite 
pleased with SuperText and recommends it highly. Griffis al- 
so makes the point that the decision about the product mix of 
word processor, eighty-column card, database management 
system, printer, and DIF program interface is not an easy one. 
He also mentions the difficulty a user can experience when a 
package does all that its advertising claims but, because of nu- 
merous disk accesses, takes too long to do it. 

Griffis offers some miscellaneous personal observations as 
well. The Apple Serial Interface card does not work well with 
the NEC Spinwriter. The Prometheus CPS card is not helpful if 



you are going to be doing graphics on a Spinwriter. The M & R 
Fan is a less optimal choice. A better one is the R. H. Super 
Fan II. In addition, Griffis recommends the following pack- 
ages and products: Sensible Software's Apple Speller, the Vi- 
dex Enhancer II, Saturn Systems VC-Expand and RAM 
boards (essential if you're doing VisiCalc spreadsheets), the 
Keyboard Company's Numeric Key Pad, and an Epson MX- 
100 dot matrix printer. 

Another reader, Byron Klrkwood from Dallas, Texas, 
writes about DB Master. There's a lot that Klrkwood likes 
about the program, but he also wants to share with other user 
group members some observations about Its use. He finds the 
requirement to use two or three disks for storage and informa- 
tion about a particular file — no matter how small it is — a bit 
cumbersome and feels that the backup procedure could be im- 
proved. He also feels that the documentation is not the best. 

Klrkwood has had some experience with High Technolo- 
gy's Information Master. He found it to be a pretty decent 
database package but did not choose to pay the additional $35 
to upgrade his version to a newer one. In this case as well, 
Kirkwood feels that the documentation is not at all well done. 

The kinds of comments represented by the above para- 
graphs can serve us all well. We need to share with one an- 
other. Of course, these remarks represent the opinions of sin- 
gle users. Some vendors may find this annoying, but it can be

very valuable to share with one another our good and bad ex- 
periences. Each of us is sophisticated enough to take what is 
said with the proverbial grain of salt. What is good for one per- 
son may be bad for another. We are all responsible for our own 
decisions. With this in mind, we will print opposing views from 
other group members or even from the vendors themselves, so 
join in. 

User Profiles. Question: What do blackjack, nonverbal 
communication, football, and the state of Missouri have in 
common? Answer: Ken Cooper. 

Cooper and his company (Ken Cooper Communications) 
are located in Ellisville, Missouri. Cooper's system consists of 
a 64K Apple n, two disk drives, an Epson MX-SOPT, the SUP 
'r* TERM eighty-column board, and a BMC CRT. He uses the 
CCA Data Management System for keeping track of promo- 
tional appearances for his business, maintaining customer 
name and address files, and (as a hobby) keeping a file of 
real/stage names of famous personalities. 

Since Cooper does quite a lot of writing (more on this later) , 
he has Superscribe II. He uses it to write articles, prepare book 
manuscripts, and send out newsletters to his clients. Since he 
has some programming knowledge, he has developed some 
applications in Basic and in Pascal. He also uses VisiCalc. 
What for? Well, Cooper is the author of The World's Greatest 
Blackjack Book (Doubleday) and Pro Football Apples, which 
handicaps pro football games using the Apple. Both of Coo- 
per's books contain information generated on his Apple. He is al- 
so the author of The World's Greatest Blackjack Program, 
which runs on the Apple. Oh, yes. Cooper has also written and

eral boxes of reference material to and from the job. In addi- 
tion, there was a significant typing requirement that often in- 
volved the hiring of expensive temporary help. 

With the introduction of the Apple, the logistical effort has 
been reduced to simply selecting the appropriate disks and 
packing the computer in its carrying case. The clerical costs 
have decreased by more than 75 percent. Eckwall uses com- 
mercially available software for all his company's applica- 
tions, and is quite satisfied with Microtelegram, Magic Win- 
dow, APM, and VisiCalc. 

New Crop of Products. Marathon Microsystems, Inc. 
(Evanston, IL) ; has gathered, tested, and now offers a large 
variety of farm software, including accounting packages for 
farmers who are doing single or double entry bookkeeping. 
These systems write checks, maintain multiple bank bal- 
ances, and direct the farmer to the appropriate IRS schedule 
at tax time. 

Two of the packages they offer, Ag-Finance and Farm- 
plan, are designed specifically for use in managing a farm. Ag- 
Finance (Countryside Data) requires 64K, while Farmplan 
(Farmplan Computer Systems) requires 48K. Both programs 
call for two disk drives. Included are systems for herd man- 
agement, nutrition planning, and managing feed-lot opera- 
tions, to name a few. If your recent harvest included an Apple, 
or soon will, consider requesting more information from MMI. 
They're a good source of information about available soft- 
ware. Since they act as agent for a variety of vendors, they are 
in the position to recommend the right system for the prospec- 
tive user. 

Product Review. Dakin5 Corporation (developers of The 
Controller and The Analyser) now have another product de- 
signed for the small business. The Depreciation Planner is a 
complete asset management system that keeps track of de- 
preciable assets for income tax purposes. It calculates de- 
preciation automatically for each asset and this creates 
models to determine the effects that different depreciation 
methods will have on a particular asset. While the progfram is 
certainly likely to interest users of The Controller (it can auto- 
matically post to The Controller) , it can be used as a stand- 
alone program as well. 

This new package is quite complete. It consists of program 
disks, data disks, and backup copies (eight disks in all) ; plenty 
of specially designed disk labels, a practice workbook that takes 
the user through a sample application, and a thorough user 
guide. 

The package includes the following programs: 

1. The Asset Manager — allows you to add, change, and re- 
tire assets. 

2. Depreciation Modeling — allows you to experiment with 
different methods of doing depreciation. 

3. The Asset Register— ^rovi^es you with a printed list of 
all assets and their depreciation status, presented in a variety 
of formats. 

4. The Retirement Master — lists all assets that have been 
retired in the current month and current year. (A distribution 
journal that shows what accounts are affected by the retire- 
ment of the asset is also printed.) 

5. The Depreciation Register — prints a list of depreciable 
assets and a distribution journal. 

6. The Investment Tax Credit module — prints a list of all 
items that are potentially eligible for an investment tax credit. 

7. A close-month routine — allows users of The Controller 
to post any appropriate transactions to their master files. It al- 
so provides for a formal "month closing" within the Deprecia- 
tion Planner packages. 

8. Startup — a program that takes the new user through 
the process of starting up The Depreciation Planner for the 
first time. 

9. A customizing features module — allows you to tailor the 
package to the requirements of your own particular business. 

10. Utilities — provides you with the means of making back- 
up disks. 

It's possible to have up to 750 assets retained at any one 
time and to save up to ten depreciation models on each data

disk. The dollar amount used can be up to ten digits in length, 
with two of these digits being the decimal portion of the 
number. 

The user guide is printed on quality stock using a typeface 
that is easy on the eyes, and is clearly indexed and organized. 
Each chapter begins with a highlighted inset that indicates 
what program should be used. The reader will find actual 
screen illustrations — enlarged so they can be easily under- 
stood — in each chapter. The appendices begin with a section on 
setting up the hardware you may have connected to your sys- 
tem, along with summaries on data entry, editing, trouble- 
shooting, and interpreting error messages. A list of the calcu- 
lations that are used to do the depreciation calculations is in- 
cluded, along with a glossary of terms. 

In sum. The Depreciation Planner is well documented, easy 
to use, and quite thorough in its coverage of the depreciation 
process. Even if you don't have The Controller, you may want 
to take a look at this asset manager. 

Resource C)omer. We recently came across a couple of ref- 
erences that some of you may find useful. They are Your 
Small Business Computer by Donald Shaw (Van Nostrand 
Reinhold Company) and A Layman's Guide to Installing a 
Small Business Computer by Jack Bender (Petrocelli Books) . 
Both books are easy to read and provide useful checklists to 
use in evaluating your reqmrements for a small business com- 
puter. There are not yet a lot of books in this area, so it's diffi- 
cult to rate these two in terms of their competition, but as more 
candidates enter the field we'll be arriving at a list of the best 
books and references available on particular topics. 

Updates. Remember Olivieri's Inquisition? Well, what 
seems like two million (probably closer to three or four thou- 
sand) replies have come in so far. Analysis is underway and 
the results will be shared with all of you eventually via this col- 
umn. If you haven't sent yours in, why not take a minute to do 
just that. Your opinions are important. 



While we're on the subject of opinions, a note came in from 
Michael Decker of Chicago who justifiably objected to a 
sweeping statement in a previous column about Softalk being 
the only definitive Apple resource. He is, of course, quite cor- 
rect — my enthusiasm got the best of me. As Decker points out, 
Nibble and Apple Orchard are also excellent resources for the 
Apple owner, as is Call-A.P.P.L.E. These publications often 
provide program listings, utilities, and technical information; 
all deserve the Apple owner's attention. 

It's important for you to get as wide an exposure to other 
people's opinions as possible, so take a look also at one of the 
Open Discussion letters in the April Softalk (page 10) . It gives a 
reader response to a Mind Your Business evaluation of Spec- 
trum Software's products. 

Coming Up. In future columns you'll be seeing a profile and 
review of the Apple III, a review of word processing packages, 
a review of mailing list packages, and a review of graphics 
packages. Each of these reviews is in various stages of devel- 
opment already. In the case of the reviews of word processing 
packages, mailing list packages, and graphics packages, 
we're waiting to share the information until we can give you 
comprehensive reviews of a number of packages. This is pref- 
erable to reviewing, say, one word processing package one 
month and two others several months later, since it gives you a 
better basis for comparison. 

Thanks again for reading along. Here's hoping you were ly- 
ing somewhere at the seashore, soaking up sun's rays and 
listening to the surf crash against the sand. Until next time, 
take care. JM

disk subsystem for tfie Apple lis. 

THE THIRD ACE— A70 

The A70 is the price/capacity alternative. 
At over a quarter million bytes per drive, the A70 
has the capacity of two Disk lis or on eight-inch 
floppy, but costs only slightly more than a single 
Disk II. One A70 supports a DOS file as large as 
270K, a CP/M file up to 254K, and 560 blocks 
in Pascal.

THE BASIC 



91 




ByWm.V R. Smith 



Back in the early days, before the disk drive, Apple II pro- 
grammers and enthusiasts had to save and load their pro- 
grams from cassette tape. The average library consisted of fif- 
ty to one hundred cassettes with information recorded on both 
sides or, in the case of a low-budget library, a small number of 
ninety-minute cassettes with dozens of programs recorded on 
each side. 

No matter which type of cassette system (the low-budget 
method or the multiple-cassette method) was being used, it 
was still up to the user to write down program names, cassette 
designations, and locations on the cassettes where programs 
were to be found. 

The availability of the floppy disk drive proved to be a god- 
send to those with cassette libraries. Not only was this new 
storage medium faster, it also maintained an up-to-date direc- 
tory (or catalog) of the files the disk contained. It was now 
easy to print the catalog of each disk to paper and then attach 
the paper to the disk. Within a short time the multiple cassette 
library was transformed into a multiple disk library. 

The disk operating system (DOS) was amazing. It would 
load, save, and maintain program and data information with 
uncanny accuracy and speed. The operator could view the 
catalog at any time with a few simple keystrokes. But it wasn't 
very long after cassette users became familiar with the Apple 
disk system that a serious handicap was discovered. Unfortu- 
nately, there wasn't a simple method for a Basic program to 
access the disk's file names in the directory. Unless you had in- 
timate knowledge of how the disk worked, it was near to im- 
possible to view a disk catalog for the occurrence of a certain 
file (data or program) . 

Subsequently, several utilities were created that partially 
dealt with this problem. The majority of these routines would 
issue a catalog command, extract the file names from the vid- 
eo screen, and convert the names to Basic string variables. In 
fact, one of the first programs supplied in Basic Solution con- 
tained a routine of this sort. However, this way of proceeding 
had proved to have an immediate flaw: If the (isk catalog was 
larger than one page, the first file names in the list would be 
scrolled off the top of the screen and therefore lost to view. 

The real solution to the problem requires leaving the do- 
main of Basic and handling a little bit of machine language, 
thus extracting disk file name information to be used by a Ba- 
sic program. To begin this task, you must first understand how 
information is stored on the Apple disk and learn the locations 
of the handy routines in the disk operating system that will 
help you extract the catalog information. 

To understand how information is stored on the disk, let's 
look at a disk for a moment. A disk is basically a round, flat, 
plastic circle coated with magnetic material (very much like 
cassette tape, but resembling somewhat a phonograph rec- 
ord) . Information must be organized on this disk in a physical 
manner. 

It was decided to store the information in tracks surround- 
ing the disk center, very much like the grooves of a record. 
But, unlike the grooves of a record, which start on the outside 



and slowly spiral inward, each disk track starts a certain dis- 
tance from the center, travels around the disk, and meets itself 
at the exact place that it started. This concentric track, or ring, 
could be treated like a strip of magnetic tape where data could 
be saved and loaded as the disk spun under the recording head. 
A disk can have a number of rings depending upon the size of 
the recording head and various other magnetic properties. The 
DOS programmers selected thirty-five rings spaced at an ap- 
propriate distance to prevent crosstalk or interference from 
other rings. 

It turns out that, at the speed the disk is traveling, almost 
4K of information can be stored on each ring. This is a lot of 
data to be handled at one time by a program attempting to 
read or write information. Apple decided to break each one of 
these rings into smaller sections called sectors. Those of you 
who've been with the Apple a while, may remember the thir- 
teen-sector DOS. The current disk operating system contains 
sixteen sectors on each one of these tracks and each sector con- 
tains 256 pieces or bytes of information. Each sector is now

Station Master 

for the Apple 11' or Apple II Plus 

Computer Station has long been known for its graphic developments for 
the Appple Computer. The Dithertizer ll^*^ is a video digitizer board which 
loads the hi-res screen with a video camera. Combined Enhanced Graphics 
Software (CEGS) dumps the contents of the hi res screen onto paper for a 
large variety of printers by means of low-cost software package. 

We now introduce the Station Mastcr^'*^ The Station Master is a uni- 
versal parallel card with the added capability of being able to put the hi res

normal or expanded size, picture or plot, and horizontal positioning. 

The Station Master card is supplied with printer cable so you just plug in 
and go. We also include a diskette with practice pictures and plots as well as 
drivers for use with Visiplot^'^ 

The Station Master offers compatibility with BASIC. Pascal 11. CP/M 
and application software. The documentation includes helpful information 
for first-time users about hi-res graphics and how to use the board with pro- 
grams such as Applcwriter™. Apple Plot'^'^, Visicalc^M and Visiplot™

Nothing in my back- 
ground prepared me for 
the necessity of having 
to write my own soft- 
ware for my Apple III. 

When I was a pilot on 
the Mississippi River, I 
always knew where I 
was, where I'd been, and 
where I was going. Not so 
when I'm in the middle of 
a program. 

Observing jumping 
frogs in California and 
the quaint customs of the 
Sandwich Islanders were 
not good training grounds 
for coping with hex 
numbers. 

Now I have the Pro- 
gram Writer/Reporter 
from Vital Information. 
Just by answering ques- 
tions on the screen, I can 
develop interactive pro- 
grams that perform most 
of the information proc- 
essing I require. 

In fact, I was just 
showing Jim how much 
fun it can be, and now 
he's taken over the whole 
show, giving me enough 
time to write this 
testimonial. 

Your obedient servant, 

S. Clemens

**About The Dvorak Simplified Kieyboard 

The "Qwerty" arrangement that we are all accustomed to was scientifically designed to be as inefficient as possible, to prevent keyjams on the first typewriters of the 
1870's. Sheer inertia has kept that arrangement in use to this day, even though in 1 932, professor A. Dvorak invented (and patented) a new arrangement that makes 
sense. The most often used keys are on the "home" row, and the strongest fingers get most of the work.

Entering Tfext... Easier Than a Typewriter 

Enter text quickly and a few commands does it all. As 
on a typewriter, you access upper case letters with the 
SHIFT key But Format-II is smarter than a typewriter 
since there is no need to press RETURN at the end of 
each line, Format-II wraps text from line to line for you. 



Effortless Formatting 



FORMAT TEXT MODE IDENTIFIED

Line: 19 [60] Position : 38 



FORMAT-II turns your Apple II into a 
powerful and effective word processor. If you 
are not familiar witfi computers or, for that 
matter, with word processors, do not worry. 

The Apple and FORMAT-il behave iil<e a 
typewriter in some ways, but instead of 
printing directly on your paper, your typing stores 
information directly in the computer memory. 
Once it's in the memory, it can be displayed 
on the screen and, more importantly, it can be 
edited, reorganized, or fed out to a printer. 
Furthermore, the information - your text - can 
be stored away safely on a floppy disk. ■

The most important peripheral for your 

Apple II. 





JUST CLIPS ON. 
NO MOUNTING OR 
HARDWARE REQUIRED. 

COLOR MATCHED TO 
APPLE II. 



For Cooling 



As soon as you move to 64K RAM or 
80 columns you need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral cards 
generate more heat. In addition, the cards 
block any natural air flow through the Apple 
II creating high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the cards and 
the computer itself. 

SYSTEM SAVER provides correct 
cooling. An efficient, quiet fan draws fresh 
air across the mother board, over the power 
supply and out the side ventilation slots. 




For Line Surge 
Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides essential 
protection to hardware and data from 
dangerous, power surges and spikes. 

By connecting the Apple II power 
input through the SYSTEM SAVER, power 
is controlled in two ways: 1) Dangerous 
voltage spikes are clipped off at a safe 130 
volt RMS level. 2) High frequency noise is 
smoothed out before reaching the Apple II. 




For Operating 
Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two switched 
power outlets. As shown in the diagram, 
the SYSTEM SAVER efficiently organizes 
your system so that one convenient, front 
mounted power switch controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple II, monitor and printer. The 
heavy duty switch has a pilot light to alert 
when system is on. You'll never use the 
Apple power switch again!

AGAIli WrrHOOT HARDWARE! 




AND WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR 
NEW WAYS TO SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY. 




SCREEN WRITER II is, frankly, the kind of word processor you would have 
developed for yourself if you were a programmer: strict^ professional in its features, 
yet simple enough for even a beginner. And that's where we started. 

Sure, SCREEN WRITER gives you boldface, underline, global search/replace and form letter capabilities. Of course, it 
lets you eliminate the boredom of retyping redundant text. Certainly, it lets you generate up to four indices, has complete 
formatting capability as well as full editing of any DOS 3.3 text or binaiy (including APPLESOFT programs) . . . and many 
other wanted features. 

That's enough to make SCREEN WRITER a veiy good value in word processors. But, we wanted to make it the best 
value. And we did . . . by eliminating the need for you to spend hundreds of dollars extra for supportive hardware! SCREEN 
WRITER is the only word processor to offer true software based lower case, a 70 column screen and printer spooling'^ which 
allows you to edit while printing, for more efficiency. 

With these extra, money-saving features at no extra charge, we think you'll agree, SCREEN WRITER is the best value in 
word processors today. And it's yours at $ 1 29.95. WAIT! It becomes an even better value if you buy our SCREEN WRITER 
PROFESSIONAL package. Then you get the SCREEN WRITER and our $99.95 DIC TIO NARY (described on the opposite 
page) for just $199.95! 

*Printer spooling feature only available for the following printer interface cards: APPLE parallel, SSM AIO parallel or serial, EPSON APL, Centronics parallel 
and the Grappler. SCREEN WRITER II runs on any 48K APPLE Il/ll Plus with DOS 3.3, and is available now at your local computer store, or directly from . . .

Saves you from creative speling 



No matter how good your 
Apple's word processor, the 
user is human. So, the odds are 
that spelling mistakes will 
occur in almost every letter, 
document, or proposal. Many 
errors will be caused by those 
who never won a spelling-bee 
and are addicted to 'creative' 
spelling. . .while others will be 
due to keystroke 'typos'. Either 
way, spelling errors can be em- 
barrassing to you — to your 
image — to your business. 



DIC-TIO-NARY 
solves the spelling 
problem for you, 
and does it at com- 
puter speed, easily 
and almost effort- 
lessly. How easily, 
how effortlessly? 
Well, with DIC- 
TIO-NARY you 
have the option to 
correct a word 
immediately . . . 

right at the time you're doing the spelling check. No 
waiting necessary. And if, by chance, you don't know 
the correct spelling of the word, you can go into the 
wordbook right then and there and have it displayed for 
you! (Ask for these features on competitive programs, 
no matter their price, and see how fast they change the 
subject.) We think you'll find that for helpfulness our 
DIC-TIO-NARY is on par with having your favorite 
English teacher or even Mr. Webster at your elbow! 

words, words, words 

The DIC-TIO-NARY starts you off with more words 
than you'll probably ever need: 25,000 of the words used 
most often. Plus it lets you add 3000 words of your own 
choosing, so you can customize it to your specific 
needs. (By making back-up "wordbooks" you could 
have many additional lists of 3000 words!) 

how it works 

In simplest form, the DIC-TIO-NARY races through 
your document at a 2+ page-per-minute speed. It looks 
at every word in your text. At the same time it compares 
each word with those in its 28,000 wordbook . . . checking 
for any misspelling. When it catches a goof, you get to 
see the word as it was used in your text, on the screen. 
The DIC-TIO-NARY then asks how you want that par- 
ticular word handled. 













^^^^^^^ 











choices, choices 

The DIC-TIO-NARY will dis- 
play for you any word not listed 
in its wordbook and any mis- 
spelled word. It then offers you 
a choice of word-editing op- 
tions. For example: You may 
decide to ignore the word. You 
may have it marked in your text 
and/ or on the printout, for later 
identification, correction or 
replacement. You may have the 
word automatically added to 
your wordbook. Or, you may 
immediately correct the spell- 
ing (using the 
wordbook for ver- 
ification, if de- 
sired) . . . and all 
1. occurrences of 

that word will 
automatically be 
corrected through- 
out your text, keep- 
ing the original 
capitalizations or 
lower case letters! 



extras, extras 

For ease of use, for efficiency and true proofreading 
effectiveness the DIC-TIO-NARY provides you with 
many other useful goodies. You may add or delete in- 
dividual words from the wordbook ... or do the same 
with an entire list of words. You may have any portion 
of the wordbook listed, and may search it even while 
processing documents. When you add it up, you'll find 
you can't get our total combination of features in any 
other spelling program at any price. 

All in all our DIC-TIO-NARY may well be the most 
valuable and useful program since the little red school- 
house disappeared. Yet, you can enjoy all its benefits 
for only $99.95. If you ljuy our special Screen Writer 
Professional, you get the $129.95 SCREEN WRITER II 
word processor described on the left, plus The DIC-TIO- 
NARY, at the package price of $199.95. Be creative! Save 
$29.95! 

DIC-TIO-NARY works with Screen Writer II, Super- 
Scribe II, Apple Pie and Apple Writer. Requires 48K 
Apple II or 11+ with DOS 3.3. Available at your local 
computer store or directly from . . .

VersaForm. By Joseph Landau. A tight, bug-free program is a 
thing of beauty and a joy forever. On the other hand, when the 
program is one as complex and multifaceted as VersaForm, 
it's a bane to a reviewer's existence. 

The complexity of VersaForm presents only one set of 
problems. How to describe it raises yet another. Michael 
Moon, the PR tub thumper tor VersaForm , heralds it as a new 
genre of software and he may be right. He's a veteran — if any- 
one in this young industry can be called that — of the electron- 
ics industry and should be in a position to recognize new genres 
when he trips over them. 

But saying that VersaForm is a new genre leaves volumes 
unsaid. If we can't fall back on comfortable labels like "word 
processor" or "database" to describe a program, how do we 
communicate what we've seen? 

First of all, VersaForm is a business program, pure and 
simple. If your computer is in your home, you need Versa- 
Form about as badly as a Bedouin needs a fishing license. 
However, if your computer is in your office, you'll have Versa- 
Form or an entirely new and expensive computer system be- 
fore the end of the decade to do the work that VersaForm does. 

Applied Software Technology labels the program a busi- 
ness forms processor, and that will do as a launching pad for 
lack of a better place to start. 

VersaForm computerizes all your business forms. No 
matter what they are. No matter how varied. No matter what 
size. No matter what complexity. No matter what purpose. 
Any form that you now fill out regularly in the course of the 
business day can be done by VersaForm. 

Sales order forms? VersaForm them. Inventory lists? 
VersaForm them. Purchasing orders? VersaForm. Literally 
any business form can now be stored and printed out on your 
Apple. Rumor has it that the next generation of business mi- 
cros will be oriented computers to automate clerical work. Ap- 
ple owners don't need to wait; they can do it now. 

You might best understand VersaForm by imagining DB 
Master, Apple Writer, MatheMagic, and a good print-using 
program all thrown in a jumble. What would come out would 
be remarkably like VersaForm. 

Certainly there are elements of databases in the program. 
After all, it must store the data that it puts on the forms and re- 
port on that data in myriad ways. Likewise keying in the data 
requires a word processor of at least minimal sophistication. 
VersaForm also includes a calculator and some of the most so- 
phisticated print-formatting routines around. 

VersaForm will allow you to electronically duplicate your 
paper forms, fill in the data, and print it out line for line to your 
paper form. The resulting file can be used to generate other re- 
ports, such as tracking customers over their credit limits, 
back-ordered line items, or to make any other investigation in- 
to your business that might be useful. 

The form development module provides the user with 
powerful controls over the input of data. The user may require 
entry for given fields and may even establish check sums to en- 
sure accuracy of data. 

VersaForm has the capacity to provide ninety-nine look-up 



tables, each holding ninety-nine variables, for automatic en- 
try into your forms. Define a field as requiring a look-up table 
and the computer will provide the data according to the mne- 
monics you design. 

Full arithmetic extension and columnar totals can be user 
defined. 

Applied Software Technology merits several lashes with 
something slightly more painful than a wet noodle for its back- 
up policies. Backups must be purchased. This antiquated poli- 
cy deserves the scorn and derision of all serious users. No seri- 
ous application should be entrusted to one floppy disk. Mag- 
netic media is fragile and floppy magnetic even more so. En- 
lightened publishers are either providing the backup with the 
initial package or sending it free upon receipt of a warranty 
card. For business use, backups are not a privilege, they are a 
right and a necessity. 

One note of warning: VersaForm, after it's been set up, is aa 
user friendly as the next program. But no software this power- 
ful is trivial to use, and that's true of VersaForm. Don't expect to 
boot it and be running in five minutes. This is a complicated 
program that requires your full attention to use it properly. 

But once you've come to grips with the complexities of the 
setup, you'll have one of the most useful tools your business 
could desire.

Labyrinth. By Scott Schram with Doug Carlston. A new game 
similar to Crossfire? Only more difficult? That was just 
enough to spark the high-score gleam in the eyes of the Softalk 
staff when Labyrinth arrived in the game review room. 

The moniker. Labyrinth, suggests a myriad of confusing, 
complicated passageways, which is exactly true, but at first 
glance the maze seems quite harmless. Ah, but wait till you 
see what happens when the game is activated. . . . 

What seemed innocent now begins to unfurl. Walls start to 
move, while nondescript, alien protectors appear one by one in 
the square abyss in the middle of the screen, plotting their 
strategy and checking their ammunition supply before mov- 
ing into the network of cryptic arteries. 

And you are the crusading expeditioner, on a mission to 
rescue as many long-lost adventurers as you can, who are im- 
prisoned in the dark, cavernous mines of historic Prince Ju- 
lian. (Remember him from the ancient backward city of Euqu- 
bud, on the ol' Mississippi?) 

Again, as in Crossfire, keyboard letters J and L direct 
movement horizontally, I and K control vertical travel. The 
left-hand keys ESDF are delegated to shooting "zappers" at 
the guardian attackers. At times, this is relatively easy. Shoot- 
ing downward, though, seems to take more coordination and 
skill, but that can be mastered — through the appetite of ac- 
complishment — the more you play. 

The real challenge lies in being aware of your surround- 
ings — places to dart in and out of — keeping your eye on the aUen 
attackers and especially on the constantly shifting waUs. Even 
though they provide a temporary hideout, that doesn't mean 
those ahens aren't going to be hot on your trail, because their 
superior sense of perception tells them which wall is going to 
move first. So tactically speaking, you should build a small 
reserve of your own shots to blast 'em away once you're ex-

The keyboard response is not quite as fast as the pro-

sure if you get zapped unexpectedly. But conversely, Laby- 
rinth displays a well thought-out game plan that is absolutely 
deserving of merit to designers Scott Schram and Doug Carl- 
ston. The animation is smooth and each level progresses with 
variation in both speed and pattern that provides endless hours 
of competition, stimulation, and enjoyment. ^np

Bag of Tricks. By Don Worth and Pieter Lechner. It is becom- 
ing apparent that whenever these gentlemen collaborate, the 
results will have a real significance for the computer commu- 
nity. Bag of Tricks is no exception. This bag contains a disk 
with four binary programs that are massive expansions of list- 
ings printed in their previous brain child, Beneath Apple DOS. 
Each program is intended to assist the user in some aspect of 
disk manipulation, error detection, and recovery. Each of the 
programs is introduced with step-by-step tutorials that make 
the operation easy to understand. 

One of the programs is called Trax. It is able to read the 
raw data as it is actually written on the disk. In itself, this is of 
academic interest to all but the very experienced user. The 
prime function of Trax is to locate damaged sectors and to es- 
tablish whether the damage is in the sector formatting or data. 

Trax will read the entire track you specify. It will detect 
and advise the location of any abnormalities and display the 
entire address field together with the prologue and epilogue of 
each sector in that track. With another keystroke, it is possible 
to review the entire track exactly as it was read from the disk. 

The next utility is Init. While its operation is similar to the 
standard DOS init command, it differs in several significant 
ways. It can be directed to operate on one or more specified 
tracks and, where possible, to leave intact the readable data it 
finds. Init can also change the sector skewing on a track-by- 
track basis. Skewing is the order in which the sectors are writ- 
ten on a track. In DOS 3.3 this skewing is most efficient for fast 
booting but not for bload or load operations. Using Init to re- 
skew tracks 3 through 34 (nonDOS tracks) , a time reduction of 
up to 45 percent can be gained. This will introduce no compati- 
bility problems. 

Perhaps the most impressive utility of the four is Zap. With 
Zap, the contents of any sector on a disk can be read, altered, 
moved, or erased. Only a few of the more than fifty com- 
mands must be learned to start using Zap. 

After a specified sector is read, the display will show a line 
of status information, such as track and sector read. The main 
body of the screen is occupied by a complete hex display of the 
sector contents and its ASCII equivalent. Any part of this dis- 
play can be changed, using either hex representation or 
English. If a specific file is of interest (whether it be binary, 
data or random access), that file can be opened, sector-by- 
sector. 

Zap will search for a specified string either in an open file or 
on the entire disk if no file is open. There are sixteen sector-size 
buffers available ; these can be filled as desired. Another fea- 
ture is a built-in calculator. If a question mark and a hex or 
decimal number is entered, Zap will return both the hex and 
decimal values. 

Zap will accept and save user-defined macro commands. 
These are strings of commands invoked by a single assigned 
name. There are several useful macros already saved on the 
disk. Additionally, Zap will accept up to ten labels. 

Some of the handy capabilities you get with Zap are finding 
and changing the address and length values of a binary file, 
making changes in DOS directly on the disk, examining or 
changing random text files, and copying Pascal files to DOS. 
Practically anything that appears on the screen can be print- 
ed and there is also a command that enables the user to print 
notes on the output. 

While Zap is clearly the most powerful of the four pro- 



grams, Fixcat seems to be the most nearly magical. It will 
check the catalog and file pointers for integrity, produce a de- 
tailed report of the disk contents, detect and correct errors in 
the VTOC and catalog, delete DOS tracks for other uses, and 
search the disk for lost files and recover them. 

One of the measures of a top quality product is its flexibili- 
ty. Bag of Tricks will boot in any slot and operate on a floppy 
disk in either drive of any slot. If you are interested in what's 
on your disks, or how to change it, or what to do when the 
dreaded I/O error appears while you are reading your most 
valuable database disk, you'll appreciate having Bag of 
Tricks. Since this package would be a bargain at anything un- 
der $100, it is difficult to understand why It is retailing for 
$39.95. Better not to ask questions, just take advantage. You 
can't go wrong. JH

Time Zone. By Roberta Williams. Time Zone Is so different in 
depth and scope from any other computer game, it prompts 
the coining of a new term : the microepic. Written by Roberta 
Williams over a fourteen month period, this gfigantic pro- 
gram contains more than twelve hundred hl-res pictures. 
When first done, it actually filled twenty-two disks, but through 
the development of innovative new algorithms, the entire mi- 
croepic has been crammed into six disks, double-sided. The 
thirty-nine separate scenarios span historic events and loca- 
tions from fighting dinosaurs in 400 million B.C. to battling on 
an alien planet in 4082 A.D. 

Billed by On-Line as the "ultimate adventure," Time Zone 
is definitely not for the novice or intermediate level adven- 
turer. Even a veteran expert will be constantly challenged by 
the complexity and interweaving of the different strands of the 
game. Only with great skill, and some luck, will the deeper 
secrets of the game be revealed. Deadly, impassable, traps 
abound. Each scenario (time zone) is a puzzle in Itself. Some 
scenarios are diabolically deceptive dead-ends, while most 
scenarios, when solved, yield treasures or tools. These treas- 
ures and tools are used, or traded for even more useful Items, 
in other zones. 

Finally, when all the other time zones are completely 
solved and all the right items gathered, the assault on the alien 
planet of Neburon can begin. This last scenario is so intricate 
that it resides on two disk sides by itself. On-Line is estimating 
that Time Zone will require from six months to a year for most 
people to solve, making its $99.95 price one of the best bar- 
gains of 1982. 

Take heart, though: the game is difficult, not Impossible. 
Well-seasoned logic and accurate mapping skills will enable 
the intrepid time traveler to advance through the game. Be- 
cause of the large number of scenarios, anytime you get stump- 
ed at one place, there are a myriad number of alternate puz- 
zles to try. You can never get bored! Roberta Williams has 
checked for historical inaccuracies and designed the game so 
that, unlike many other adventure games, the solution to each 
puzzle is not dependent on exact phrasing. This is certainly 
very refreshing after the latest wave of games that use the 
obscurer sections of a thesaurus as a crutch to provide diffi- 
culty. 

Time Zone is not for everyone, but, for the people who do 
seek the "ultimate" in adventure games, it will stand as a sym- 
bol, Uke the winning of an Olympic gold medal, for many years 
to come. liliA

Gold Rush. By Michael Berlyn with Harry Wilker. The Old 
West is the setting for Gold Rush, a lively, new video game that 
gives you a chance to outwit an assortment of desperadoes 
who're aiming to kill you and to steal your gold. 

As the game starts, a train drops a gold prospector on the 
edge of a western frontier. Your mission: To guide the prospec- 
tor to caches of gold in the badlands and to take each one to 



JUNE 1982 



117 



mining cars waiting on the other side. You pick up the gold by 
running over it. 

To get the gold, you'll find yourself maneuvering through 
Indian territory, racing around a fort, and dodging between 
trees and mountains. You must evade an Indian on the lookout 
for interlopers, a treacherous soldier, a killer grizzly, and a 
bothersome, but innocuous, gold bug — officially known as a 
claim jumper. 

When the gold bug collides with you, it will merely steal 
your gold ; the others will take one of your three lives without 
thinking twice about it. Although you can travel up, down, left, 
and right, the pursuers have an edge: They can also move 
diagonally, cutting you off. 

Each time you safely transport eight caches of gold, you get 
a bonus round in which you have sixty seconds to deliver four 
more gold caches to the mining cars, with a gang of thieving 
gold bugs hot on your trail. If you're successful, you receive an 
extra life. 

You can get extra points by picking up shovels, picks, and 
balance scales that appear on the screen. As the game pro- 
gresses, more attackers will join in the chase, reducing your 
chances of getting out alive. 

After playing maze games that confine you to running in- 
side narrow corridors, it's refreshing to play a game like Gold 
Rush, which lets you roam more freely around the screen. 

Tricky maneuvering is required to keep you moving 
smoothly, especially as you try to circumvent some of the 
mountains and trees. The program's authors have created a 
fun and challenging game, giving you freedom of movement 
beyond that of maze games. HS

Lemmings. By Dan Thompson. Your town is being overrun by 
lemmings, those hapless rodents whose fate it is to be inexo- 
rably drawn to suicidal leaps over the cliffs and into the sea. 

Why, then, should you be concerned with their prolifera- 
tion, knowing that they themselves are bound to take care of 
the problem? To be sure, they need only reach a density of six- 
teen in this town to be overcome by that fatal yearning; at that 
point all activity stops and the lemmings do their thing. When 
they do, you lose. 

Not so well-known about lemmingps — possibly because it 
may not be so — is their propensity for swift and frequent pro- 
creation. Sirius's lemmings (and isn't it appropriate that this 
game about output should be from the most prolific of game 
publishers?) have only to pass a lemming of the opposite sex 
on the street to find themselves in the family way (it can hap- 
pen to either partner, in a new high in liberation), gestation 
lasts the merest fraction of a second, and maturity besets the 
infant equally rapidly. 

Your job is to prevent this lascivious activity and thus save 
your town from the lemmings. The town is made up of rectan- 
gular buildings laid out on a Crosshatch. Each has doors on all 
sides. You must lock a pair of lemmings into each house and, 
of course, the pair must match — girl with girl, boy with boy 
(assuming those are the varieties lemmings use) — so that no 
new lemmings will arrive. 

When you have filled every house with fruitless lemmings, 
you have succeeded on that level and can move on to try a 
more persistent, more prolific invasion. There are eight levels 
in all; once you've cleared eight, you move on to eight all over 
again. 

You are not without aid — nor is that the extent of your prob- 
lems. Aid comes in the uniform of the SPCA. This gentle or-

ganization devotes itself to neutering the lemmings you deliver 
to its truck and practicing euthanasia on lemmings who've be- 
come senile. In this strange world, lemmings may become se- 
nile at any age; this is an immediately obvious trait; and an 
encounter with a senile lemming is lethal. 

The danger of running into senile lemmings becomes more 
acute as you reach higher levels. Baby lemmings can turn se- 
nile as they mature, or one of two lemmings traveling togeth- 
er can turn, thus masked by the healthy creature. 

Lemmings requires more than simple coordination; 
strategy becomes important on the higher levels. There is no 
way to stem the onslaught on levels 6 and above by filling each 
house in a merely methodical manner. Closing all four doors 
takes time, and up there, there is no time. You'll have to be in- 
ventive and fast. 

Hi-res animation and color in Lemmings is excellent and 
smooth; sound is weird and doubly adjustable— either lower 
volume or off. Enjoyable cartoons reward your achievement 
every few levels. 

Lemmings is playable with keyboard, paddles, or joystick. 
The keyboard works excellently for this game, which uses AZ 
and the arrow keys for the four directions. Catching and drop- 
ping lemmings takes only a tap on the space bar. 

To go back to the original point, what's the point? Is your 
job to save the town from an overpopulation of lemmings? But 
if the lemmings overpopulate, they run and jump in the sea, 
taking care of the problem much more efficiently than you 
can. Is your job to save the lemmings? You're a heck of a 
savior if salvation means segregation, sterilization, and pre- 
mature senility. 

Oh, weU, it sure beats becoming an eyeball and chasing 
snakes. 

Senseless as it is. Lemmings is an enjoyable, challenging 
game that holds up through much play time. Along with 
Bandits, it is the best of Sirius's recent home-arcade offerings.

First Class Mail. By Bob Schoenburg and Steve Pollack. 
Here's a pair of authors who may be software's answer to 
Irving Wallace. Wallace is the bestselling author who hears the 
murmuring of general populace and caters to their desires. 
Bob Schoenburg and Steve Pollack seem to have the same 
trait. 

Consider. 

The pair brought out Home Money Minder, a perfectly re- 
spectable home finance package. Then they listened to the 
user feedback. The result was Home Accountant, one of the 
phenomenal success stories of the first half of 1982. 

Around the same time Home Money Minder hit, the team 
also tested the market with The Mailroom. Mailroom never 
was the success of HMM, but the authors used the same tech- 
nique — listen to the users and incorporate all the good ideas. 
The result is First Class Mail — a program that, incredibly 
enough, manages to live up to its double-entendre name. 

All of the above is not to accuse Schoenburg and Pollack of 
putting out the programming equivalent of stalking-horses to 
do their market research for them. Their original efforts do 
stand on their own merit. They just pale next to the sequels. 

First Class Mail is so well thought out and so easy to use 
that other publishers who call their programs "user friendly" 
should bow their heads in shame. 

Softalk got an early release of the program sans documen- 
tation. Yet a rank computer illiterate was able to apply the pro- 
gram to two separate uses with relatively little trouble. This is 
high praise indeed : that a novice operator could use a power- 
ful program with no more than the screen menus. 

The program allows for twelve fields, clearly more than the 
traditional name and address of a mailing label. The Implica- 
tion is that the software can be put to other innovative uses as 
well. The built-in ability to sort and filter on any field or com- 
bination thereof enhances the chances that users will find 



multiple applications for the program. 

Continental Software will actually be publishing four ver- 
sions of the program. The one already in release is for the Ap- 
ple II using floppy disks. A hard-disk version will follow. Both 
versions are pending for the Apple III as well, awaiting the de- 
velopment of a rapid binary sort subroutine.

base applications. ART

Apventure to Atlantis. By Robert Clardy. Ah, the neat, trim 
lines of another Bob Clardy adventure. No calculation of the 
odds of fist connecting with chin based on the actuarial num- 
bers for wisdom, charisma, good looks, ad nauseum. Here you 
don't get constant percentage readouts on how soon you are go- 
ing to be killed or the rate at which you are dying. Just world- 
spanning, monster-stomping, fate-of-all-mankind-in-the-bal- 
ance, meat-and-potatoes adventure fantasy. 

In truth, the classical adventure elements are present in At- 
lantis to a greater degree than in Odyssey: The Compleat Ap- 
venture, its direct ancestor. But Clardy has incorporated those 
elements into the basic charm of his unique and unmistakable 
programming style. 

At first look, the game is very similar to Odyssey. This Is, in 
fact, a sequel. Having completed your quest to gain the Orb of 
Power, you have now ascended to the throne of Lapour (if you 
didn't complete the quest, just pretend) . Atlantis, stronghold of 
science gone mad, is busy putting down a lot of bad techno-kar- 
ma on the pastoral spirituality of Lapour, causing disruptions 
in the magical fabric of your domain (with a tip of the hat to 
Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea Trilogy). Your mission, should you 
choose to accept it, is to make the Lost Continent get lost. Per- 
manently. 

Emphasis here, far more than in Odyssey, is on the 
magical. Gone are those simple pleasures of bartering for sup- 
plies, having to feed a barbarian horde, getting kicked out of a 
hermit's hovel due to lack of funds, and starving to death in the 
swamp. There are, however, consolations. You get to select an 
entourage of sorcerer's apprentices, based on their alignment, 
wisdom, spell capacity, and other personal qualities, all dis- 
cernible in advance. TTiis done, the game expands to embrace 
room exploring, maze wandering, and some fair arcade ac- 
tion, as well. 

This is a gamer-friendly adventure-fantasy. It is not pos- 
sible to get killed unless you are sincerely bent upon your own 
destruction. Inveterate gamers may consider this unfair: an 
impurity in the stern adventurer's code. It must be said, how- 
ever, that when you're veering about with a damaged direc- 
tion controller after an encounter with an Atlantean ship, pray- 
ing for an island, then sighting one but being unable to land, 
then slipping gently beneath the waves with your full comple- 
ment of wizards and hard- won spells, you are suddenly able to 
see much that is good in an option to take a fifty-point penalty 
in lieu of death. 

This is not to say that you can step through the scenario in 
one sitting, completely at ease. Even with a selection of zero 
reaction time, Atlantean patrols will do unkind things to you 
unless you do unto them first. On Atlantis, a sort of Etch-a- 
Sketch function maps out the terrain behind you, but your sur- 
roundings become more confusing as they become clearer, At- 
lantis being in reality a giant invisible maze. (Of the "hazards" 
on Atlantis referred to in the documentation, this one is to your 
blood pressure.) 

A game this big, varied, and downright agreeable must 
have its limitations. Much of the artistry of Atlantis is In the 
concealment of the wires and mirrors that make the game 
seem larger than it really is and facilitate the flow from 
wizard-recruiting mode to ocean voyage/arcade mode to 
room-exploration mode. Saving on an Island will save the 
wizards, their spells, and your own character, but you will re- 
turn to find your Inventory empty. Likewise, objects will not 
travel with you from Island to island. Thus, you couldn't "take

such as an accounting package or a word processing system, or a 
coni|>rehensi\e data base management program. This does not 
mean that store personnel do not want to give you the best service 
possible; it's just that it is an almost impossible task. If you pur- 
chase sttftware through the mail, the risks that you a.s.sume. 
w ithout a reliable guide to as.sist you should be apparent. 

Other pitfalls aw ait the uninformed buyer. For instance, in Ux) 
man\ cases you cannot b> the appearance of the package w hether 
the program retiuires Integer Basic or Applesoft Basic or whether 
it needs 16. 32 or 48K of RAM. It is also often difficult to tell 
w hen you purchase a jirogram on tape whether it can be trans- 
ferred to disk or. if a disk program is purchased, whether it can 
he copied or not. 

Another area that can present problems to the buyer is the 
similarity of software, A well-stocked computer store may 
possibly offer fi\e different word processing packages, four 
assemblers, ten different adventure type games and/or several 
mail list programs, (the choices seem endless); all of which have 
obvious ad\ antages and disadvantages as well as different prices. 

The goal of "The Book" is to eliminate as many of these poten- 
tial problem areas for the software buyer as possible, 

W e w elcome any comments or criticisms from readers that will 
help us in reaching this goal. '*

shovel," go elsewhere, then come back later to dig one of your 
guys out of the avalanche you left him under. It's now or never. 
You are limited to five wizards and warriors, and your war- 
riors mostly stand around with nothing to do (it's a wizard's 
world) . 

What the game does do is as impressive as what it seems to 
do. The search of the island castles is a complete program in it- 
self, as are the other major modes, each with a significant re- 
ward upon completion. On Atlantis, you cut away from the full 
map to a scene of what you have actually encountered at a 
given point of interest — a quantum leap over Odyssey. The ini- 
tial ingenuity required to get off Lapour is ingenious, indeed; 
probably too much so for most. In these efforts, and many sub- 
sequent ones, the official hint sheet is a nice courtesy. 

If the earthy delights of Odyssey have here receded into the 
background, such is the nature of an evolving culture. We must 
go forward, concerning ourselves with higher things. Atlantis 
is a worthy successor to its progenitor; preserving many of the 
original's noblest achievements and adding refinements that 
in turn promise even greater things in future Apventures. A(

Apple Machine Language. By Don Inman and Kurt Inman. 
True or false: 1) Of the two or three hundred thousand Apple 
owners, only two have mastered machine language and 
they're both named Steve. 2) Since there's so much canned 
software available, the only command you need to know is 
PR#6 (and maybe a little Basic), and certainly you don't need 
any machine language. 

Answers: 1) False. 2) False. Try this little experiment. Type 
call 65385. The cursor should change to an asterisk to show that 
you're in the monitor, that your Apple is not thinking in Ba- 
sic at the moment but rather will accept orders only in hexa- 
decimal numbers. Now type 300: (that's the number 300 fol- 
lowed by a colon) . Then type 20 (space) 58 (space) FC (space) 
60. What you have done is to tell the computer to store in 



memory location number 300 (hex) the number 20 (hex) , the 
number 58 in location 301, the number FC in 302 and the num- 
ber 60 in 303. 

These are the numerical codes that clear the screen. They 
are the same as the command home in Applesoft. Now return 
to Basic by typing OG (zero G) . Type call 768 (this is the deci- 
mal equivalent of 300 hex, which is necessary because Basic 
can handle only decimal notation directly) . The screen should 
clear. What you've actually done is to goto (code 20) the sub- 
routine located in memory location FC58 (yes, it's backward), 
which is the home subroutine, and then return (code 60). 

Now purposely make a mistake. Type call 65385 to return to 
the monitor. Now type 300:02 which transposes the first two 
digits in location 300. Now type OG and then call 768, your sys- 
tem should hang and require a reset. No matter what words 
you type in Basic, all commands must be translated into num- 
bers, and each different number has a different meaning. 
That's why, when you accidentally type HIME instead of 
HOME, the Apple won't try to figure out what you meant but 
instead gives you an error message and forces you to correct 
the mistake. Precision is paramount. That lesson alone prob- 
ably makes it worthwhile to learn a little machine language 
even though you never intend to become a programmer. 

While it is difficult to remember each of the numbers that 
contains an Apple instruction, machine language is concep- 
tually quite easy. Learning it is made much easier by a bridge 
between Basic and machine language the authors have de- 
veloped that they call a Basic Operating System (BOS) . In the 
first two chapters, the book develops a Basic program that lets 
you poke hex numerical commands into decimal memory lo- 
cations so that you can concentrate on learning machine lan- 
guage commands without worrying about the conversion from 
decimal to hex. For example, as mentioned above, 20 hex (32 
decimal) means the same as goto. The machine language 
command A9 (which happens to be the hex number whose 
decimal equivalent is 25) tells the computer to store the num- 
ber that follows it into a storage register called the accumula-

tor. Using BOS. the newcomer to machine language quickly 
learns to treat 20 and A9 as commands meaning groto and store 
in accumulator, and can forget the fact that they also happen to 
be hex numbers that he would count on his fingers and toes as 
32 and 25. 

Having created this aid, Inman and Inman, very slowly and 
with lots of repetition in the early chapters, show the reader 
how to draw lo-res pictures in machine language using only a 
few two-character commands. Next they turn the Apple into 
an electric organ that will play up to 255 different tones through 
the built-in speaker. This one requires only 26 bjrtes of 
memory. 

After combining the graphics and music programs, the au- 
thors abandon BOS, which has served its purpose, and show 
the reader how to enter machine language codes directly from 
the monitor (as we did above). They then cover more difficult 
exercises including machine langxiage arithmetic. 

It's a very useful little book. Because its organization is well 
thought out, it works well as a self-teaching text. You won't be- 
come a polished machine language programmer from it — only 
lots of practice can do that — but you will be able to write small 
programs in machine language. Perhaps even more impor- 
tant, you will have a much better understanding of how your 
Apple really works. It requires Applesoft either in ROM (as in 
an Apple II Plus) or on a plug-in card; this will be sufficient for 
the first ten chapters. The last two chapters cover the mini-aa- 
semtjler, which is not available for the plus versions, and thus 
require an Apple II with Integer Basic in ROM and Applesoft 
on the plug-in card. (UL

Gin Rummy. By Art Carpet. It's not clear that the Apple mar- 
ket has much room in it for such sedentary entertainment ac- 
tivities as card playing. Instead, the emphasis seems to be on 
fast-moving, colorful arcade-style games. 

But any gin rummy player with a nickel or so left after his 
purchases of Labyrinth and Bandits will find nothing but pure 
pleasure in this latest offering from Art Carpet — his first un- 
der the DataMost imprimatur. 

Rummy actually offers the player a choice of three 
games — gin rummy, knock rummy, or an obscure version 
called one-meld in which most gin strategy is reversed. 

Apple as a rummy opponent is clever enough to cast out 
bait for a card he's looking for, but has a tendency to speculate 
a little too much to be a topnotch opponent. Nevertheless, he's 
a formidable opponent in that he'll knock early and catch a hu- 
man unawares with tons of unmatched tens remaining if the 
human doesn't pay attention. 

As interesting and fun a pastime as Rummy certainly is, 
this is a package equally as interesting for its lessons about the 
marketplace. Rummy is illustrative of the virtue of perse- 
verance on the part of Carpet and of forbearance on the part 
of the marketplace. 

Gin Rummy is actually Carpet's third program. His first, 
Cribbage, was published by Rainbow. While a creditable en- 
try, it was overwhelmed by the flashier Hi-Res Cribbage of 
Warren Schwader. But the experience gave Carpet a taste for 
the market and he next delivered Solitaire, a four-game pack- 
age under his own Computek label. Solitaire was leagues 
ahead of Cribbage in graphics and programming technique, 
but proved that one-man companies these days have a much 
tougher row to hoe than those of a couple of years ago. 

This time all the elements seem to be as favorable as they 
can get. Carpet has delivered his best effort to date and linked

Assembler Teacher. By John Fairfield. This program would 
seem to offer to do something wonderful: Turn your Apple into 
a teaching machine, and teach you assembly language the 
easy way! That's a lovely idea, and quite practical — some- 
body ought to write such a program, but this program isn't it. 

"That's unfortunate, because the author knows what he's 
talking about and explains it clearly and pleasantly. He could 
probably have written an excellent textbook on the subject, but 
instead has created a very weak teaching machine. And that's 
not the worst of it. 

The main problem with this program if you're trying to 
learn assembly language is that it doesn't go far enough. It in- 
troduces a few concepts — binary and hex numbers, memory 
addresses, and a memory map — but it doesn't tell you much 
about them. Then you're referred to the teacher's manual, 
where a subroutine from the program is analyzed in detail, 
just as it would be in a textbook. Then you're sent back to the 
Apple, where the program tells you something about the five 
addressing modes of the 6502 (immediate, indirect, indexed, 
and so on), and demonstrates the compare instruction and 
some of the branch instructions. 

Then you come to Lesson K, which begins: "There is a 
whole lot left to learn. Your next step is to get a good assembly 
language text . . . The texts have many good example pro- 
grams. Type them in and step them through so you under- 
stand exactly what they're doing." It offers a few more re- 
marks like that, and then it ends. 

If you take a moment to reread the introduction to the 
teacher's manual you'll come upon the following statement: 
"When Assembler Teacher is finished with you, you will not be 
a good assembly language programmer, but you will be over 
the learning barrier and fully equipped to fend for yourself 
from that point on." (Italics ours.) 

Well then, let's consider the program as a machine-as- 
sisted introduction to assembly language. Is it useful in that 
form? 

Not really. The program does modify your Apple into a kind 
of teaching device — but instead of an interactive teaching ma- 
chine, what you get is more like an obsolete filmstrip projec- 
tor. All the program does is present the text material of the 
course, one page (screenful) at a time. The so-called teaching 
program is no more than a textbook on disk. In fact, it's rather 
less. It turns out to be harder to read, and much harder to learn 
from, than a regular paper textbook. 

When you read a textbook, your eye tends to skip around. 
You reread the paragraph you just finished to make sure it's 
clear; you check the previous paragraph to see how it ties in; 
maybe you skip ahead to see where the author is going next. 
All of this involves rehearsing the information you've just ac- 
quired, as a psychologist would call it, and it's often a neces- 
sary step if you're going to understand what you're reading — 
let alone to learn from it. 

You can't do any of that with Assembler Teacher. 

And forget about going back for another look at the last 
screenful you read: the only control options you get, in text 
mode, are "Hit C to continue, Q to quit." To review the pre- 
vious page, you have to type Q; then call the lesson back, 
which will restart it at the beginning; then use C to page 
through it, until you reach the place you want to review. 

Rather than assisting learning, this program interferes 
with learning! 

The utility routines that come with the system are conveni- 
ent and do what they're supposed to, but you don't really need 
them. 



The Apple Mini-Assembler, for example — standard on In- 
teger Basic Apples, but omitted from Applesoft II units (you 
may have it in your system already) — does little more than look 
up the machine codes for the mnemonics you enter (such as 
LDA, STA, JMP, and so on), and store them in successive 
memory locations. That's nice, but if you write your programs 
out on paper first — and you'd better, or Murphy'U get you! — 
you can look up those numbers yourself easily enough. Then 
you can enter them, just as easily, through the Monitor (stand- 
ard on both Applesoft and Integer systems) . This is a bit more 
work than with the Mini-Assembler — but the practice you get 
will teach you the language faster: and that's why you're here, 
isn't it? 

There's also a routine to display an input byte in five for- 
mats (binary, hex, positive integer, signed integer, and ASCII 
character) , which is clever but actually no easier than looking 
them up on a chart — and you already have such charts in your 
Apple books. 

A memory map routine, that displays what kind of infor- 
mation is stored in each page of your Apple's memory, could 
have been very useful if only the author had told us how it 
makes its decisions so we would know how far to trust it ; but no 
such information is included. 

And finally, there's the teacher's manual. It's excellent, as 
far as it goes; but the only part that really teaches you any- 
thing is the analysis of a subroutine from the program, which 
is only five pages long. 

Will this program help you learn assembly language? Well, 
in order to follow it faithfully, you must get a good book and 
teach yourself from that. So think of it this way: if you are 
motivated to learn from a book, get one and do so! It's more 
fun than you might think. If you are not highly motivated, this 
program probably will not help you. ID

Richard Bach 

from page 82 — 

ger on it precisely — that is what keeps people from doing what 
they really want to do. And at the same time there's somebody 
in that little town in Wyoming thinking, 'Gee, I'd like to go to 
New York City, there would be so many things for me to learn 
in New York City, but I guess I'll stay right here.' " 

Bach spent several summers barnstorming in the Mid- 
west — flying from town to town in his antique biplane and sell- 
ing rides to the farmers and their kids for three dollars. His ad- 
ventures were chronicled in Nothing by Chance, and in part, in 
Illusions: Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah. 

Flight Plan. Looking back now, Bach recalled, the "practi- 
cal" part of himself rang out loud and clear that his barn- 
storming adventure would be impossible to carry out. He told 
himself: "You're going to get yourself sued. You're going to 
land on somebody's cow. The farmer's going to come out with 
a shotgun, and your airplane's going to be impounded, and 
you're just going to be stopped cold. You can't do that. You 
can't bring 1929 into the middle of 1982. 

"I know now that that fear is nonsense," said Bach. "I know 
that the same fields that were being cultivated for hay in 1879 
are cultivated for hay today. Next year they'll be cultivated for 
corn, but the year after that they'll be cultivated for hay. 

"And hay — after they cut it — they don't mind if you land in 
the hay before it's greened-up again. 

"So use your airplane and your common sense and cour- 
tesy. Don't land in a money crop. Don't land in the hay where 
it's starting to grow young again. But if you see the mower and 
the baler go through, and they've got bales and they've left a 
little row, then come down. 

"Right next to a little town — the town can't be more than fif- 
teen hundred people, two thousand people is getting too big — 
you circle overhead. You might even go outside the town, do a 
little loop, a roll, spiral down, and land. People'll come out and 
they say, 'What's wrong? This airplane's gone crazy and it's in 
trouble.' 

"Soon as they show up you say, 'How would you like to see 
your town from the air?' And they look at you crazy, and sud- 
denly dim little sparkles come to their eyes, and they say, 'No- 
body's landed in that field for forty years, did you know that?' 

"And they bring out their scrapbooks, and sure enough, 
there's an old dusty photograph of an old airplane, landed in 
that same field. You're aware of the sense of continuity — that 
you, as a barnstormer, have been part of a tradition. 

"This is what I know now. And I filled in my yearnings with 
things I didn't imagine. I didn't imagine people would bring out 
chicken salad sandwiches. In wicker baskets. With gingham 
cloths over them! People saying: 'You've been working hard 
all day and we just thought you might want some lunch and 
some lemonade. Stop for a while and sit under the tree with us.' 

"I never would have imagined that, but it happens! It hap- 
pens for anyone who says 'I will try this thing'— whatever 
crazy thing that we most love to do." 

From that learning, according to Bach, our whole view of 
what this world is can change. "Instead of seeing steely-eyed 
farmers with shotgiins in their hands, I now see, as I look 
across the Midwest, people with their roots in the same earth I 
know. They welcome you, if you show courtesy, to land in their 
fields with the gift you have to give them." 

Every once in a while, on those barnstorming tours, some 
wistful soul would approach Bach, the pilot, with, "Gee, I wish I 
could go with you. What a life you must have ! Up over the ho- 
rizon! All that excitement!" 

And Bach, the free spirit, would answer, "Then come along. 
I can always use someone to sell tickets. Come on. Let's go. 
Right now!" 

The replies were always the same : If it weren't for my job 
... If it weren't for my mother. If it weren't for this. If it 
weren't for that. 



"I know as we sit here talking, those fields are waving with 
young hay," he said. "They are available to us if you want. 

"You don't have to have a job at a desk in an office. You can 
if you want to, but, just as easily, you can wake up in the morn- 
ing and not know where you'll end up by the afternoon. You can 
base your decision on which direction the wind is blowing." 

Bach has abandoned the hay, wicker baskets, and lemon- 
ade for the pilots who come after him. There are other things 
he wants to do now. 

"I want to explore this mystical network of the microcom- 
puter and what it has to offer. It's vastly challenging. 

"Boot a program. If somebody had said 'Boot a program' to 
me three years ago, I wouldn't have understood what it meant. 
'The disk crashed' — what do you mean — a flying saucer land- 
ed in a field?" 

In the same way. Bach knows that three years from now, he 
and Leslie will have new vocabularies, new experiences, new 
delights, and some new despairs. And from this learning, the 
author said, comes the power to affect the world in the ways 
best suited to our individual talents. 

Bach makes his contribution through his writing, but he 
wasn't always a writer. He's the veteran of a number of jobs — 
none of which he was ever able to hold more than eleven 
months: mail carrier, motion picture stunt pilot, aircraft riv- 
eter, telescope mirror maker, jewelry designer, telephone 
book deliverer, charter pilot, magazine editor, museum de- 
signer, aircraft mechanic, flight instructor, draftsman, and 
barnstormer. 

After all this job-storming, it occurred to Bach one day that 
he had actually been paid money once for a story he had writ- 
ten while still in high school. An English teacher had bribed the 
students with an "A" for anyone who would be able to publish a 
story and get paid for it that semester. 

Bach sold a story he had written about telescopes to the 
Sunday supplement of a local newspaper for $25, minus $7 the 
newspaper took out of his paycheck to cover the cost of the pic-

Would You Buy a New Car 

Without 
Driving it First? 

1 wouldn't! And I don't want to buy software I can't take a close look at 
either . 

That's the reason I've organized the FIRST LOOK COLLECTION for Apple* 
owners who have a disc drive. As a member you can make a 15% down payment 
on most software, and I'll let you evaluate it for three weeks. If you decide 
not to buy, just return the program; and your down payment will be my only 
service charge. 



I'll only send you programs 
you ask for. You never have 
to buy anything. But if you 
do decide to buy, I'll sell to 
members at low membership 
prices. 



Collectioti 



Also, I'm going to offer 
some special software bargains. 
For instance, I don't intend to 
send preview discs out over and over 
again until the oxide falls off. After a 
program has been previewed a few times, 
I'm going to sell it. 

My goal is to sell good software 
you've had a chance to take a close look 
at and you're satisfied with. I think the 
FIRST LOOK COLLECTION will stimulate 
the growth and development of high- 
quality software. 

I've talked to all the major publishers, 
and they are delighted to have us repre- 



sent them. I am stocking best- 
selling games, utilities, and 
high quality educational soft- 
ware designed for home use; 
but members will have a 
strong voice in the software 
we handle. So when you join, 
tell me the kinds of things 
you're interested in. 



In fact, list the three programs under 
$50 each you're most interested in and I'll 
let you preview two of them as part of your 
membership fee. The charter fee is only 
$45, so it's hard to lose. This membership 
fee will not only include a 15% down pay- 
ment on your first two selections, but it 
will get you my FIRST LOOK COLLECTION 
catalog chock-full of reviews and illustra- 
tions of the latest in software. 



Yes, I want to join the FIRST LOOK COLLECTION! Please 

send me a catalog and two of the three progr-ams I've listed 
for preview.

tures they had to take themselves. So with the memory of that 
success still strong, Bach added "writer" to his long list of ca- 
reers. It's turned out to be the job he's been able to hold the 
longest. 

Bach said he owes a lot to author Ray Bradbury, who took 
him under his wing and told him to write lots. Bach did and got 
lots of rejection slips, including those for Jonathan Livingston 
Seagull. 

Not Bad for a C!ollege Drop-out. Jonathan Livingston Sea- 
gull sold more than a million copies in 1972 alone, breaking all 
records since Gone With the Wind. Approximately 24 million 
copies have been sold to date. Illusions (published in 1977) and 
There's No Such Place As Far Away (1979) were also bestsell- 
ers ; Illusions stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for 
almost two years, longer than any book in history. 

"A professional writer," said Bach, "is an amateur who 
doesn't give up." 

Author Bach has several other credits to his name : He once 
beat the MIT chess computer and was told by the staff never to 
come back again ; he challenged Chou En Lai to a Ping-Pong 
match "to settle the issue" when Jonathan Livingston Seagull 
was banned from the People's Republic of China; He was 
offered an honorary doctorate at Embry Riddle Aeronautical 
University, but turned it down in favor of an honorary me- 
chanic's license; and he can also make a mean batch of pan 
bread. 

Bach has just started working on a new book, expected to 
be his longest one yet. Before he started writing on a comput- 
er. Bach said blizzards of notes and tiny scraps of paper were 
always being lost. He and Leslie now own two Apple Ills and a 
II; they needed the expanded memory of the III for the new 
book and also for the culmination of the forestry battle. 

The Bachs praise the Apple III, but in contejct — and by no 
means will they endorse the Apple III without reservations — 
especially for a person who plans to use it for book writing or 
for converting files from an Apple II. They bought it so they 



could run the Apple Writer III word processing program and, 
in the process of trying to fashion a working system out of it, 
just about threw the entire machine out the window along with 
their frustrations. 

They bought a Corvus Systems five-megabyte drive to sim- 
ulate a huge memory, and then they had worse problems. 

"How can Corvus advertise their drive for the Apple III, 
show photographs of it plugged into an Apple III word proces- 
sor, and sell it — without any way for the average user to con- 
nect it to her or his Apple III — how can Corvus do that?" 

Paul Lutus, who wrote the Apple Writer word processing 
programs and is a friend of the Bachs, was able to get the sys- 
tem running. Lutus managed, said Bach, "thanks to some 
exotic expert's knowledge of both the Corvus and the SOS." 

Since then, the Bachs were surprised one evening by a visit 
from Apple Computer's regional director for their area — sur- 
prised especially because their island is difficult to get to. 

Apple's representative went over their system carefully. 
Indeed, the Corvus problems would have to wait for Corvus; 
but the Apple problems were traced to a minor adjustment 
needed in one disk drive. The Apple rep made that fix, then dis- 
covered an as yet unencountered problem in Leslie Bach's Ap-- 
ple III. Solution? Out of his little black bag, a shiny new III to 
replace the offending one. 

Now, except for the Corvus hookup, temporarily aban- 
doned, the Bach's Apple III systems are running as so earnest- 
ly desired. 

"Our love affair with Apple?" Bach quoted. "It's on, defi- 
nitely on. They couldn't have gone to more trouble or given us 
more consideration. We're thrilled." 

Lest you're saying to yourself that Apple might do that for 
Richard Bach, but what if the problems were Joe Blow's? Be 
reminded that all Apple Ills sold before that machine's prob- 
lems were solved have been replaced by Apple with new Ills. 

No Man Is an Island. The advertising from Apple and other 
computer hardware and software companies that is sexist or

blatantly ignores women also infuriates the Bachs — especially 
Richard. 

"Apple Computer manufactures such a brilliant product. 
But to see that company discount women, put them down, turn 
them off — the stupidity of that outrages me." 

Let Richard Bach run Apple for Just one week and he prom- 
ises to institute changes that will be like a jump to light speed. 
One of his first memos would read: "Don't ignore half the 
population of this world." 

Bach said it takes much more strength to be an individual 
who happens to be a woman than it does to be an individual 
who happens to be a man. 

"Women must know themselves so well, that they'll say 
when they see one of those stupid ads, 'I know those clods are 
men, and I know they've written this to appeal to men, but I 
don't care. I need this information. I'm going to walk in this di- 
rection and I'm going to accomplish what I need to accom- 
pUsh for my own learning and for my own development as a 
human being.' " 

And, added LesUe, "We've introduced a number of hus- 
band-wife couples to the Apple, and it's always been the wom- 
an who uses it more intensely. 

"I had somebody put a computer under my nose just once. 
That's what I'd like to tell all women: Just go put it under your 
nose just once." 

The Bachs realize they have done their share of gnashing 
and fuming at the problems as well as the advertising prob- 
lems with Apple and Corvus. But at the same time they realize 
and unabashedly admit they want so badly to reach out and 
grasp the world of computing. It's been a stormy love affair, 
but it's still a love affair. 

"We have the capacity within us now, the basic ability to do 
anything. We are unlimited creatures," Bach said. He be- 
lieves people are capable now of teleporting themselves from 
place to place without using our normal modes of transporta- 



tion and communicating psychically with each other over vast 
distances and time. Though we may not be doing this as a com- 
mon practice for a few years yet, he adds, until we unlearn our 
Umits. 

"If we are in fact unlimited creatures, we do not have to 
limit ourselves and our bodies to space and time at all. How- 
ever, the computer is a mechanical step that makes it so much 
easier now, making it possible for us to be in touch with those 
people from whom we have much to learn and to whom I have 
something to give." 

Computers and modems can overcome a great many bar- 
riers to communication, he explained. It is communication that 
can bypass physical appearance and background ; instead, ev- 
erything can be referenced to spirit and intellect : What do you 
think? Why do you think it? What are your suggestions? How 
do you approach this problem? Bach even thinks nuclear war 
would be a simple problem to overcome once enough people 
with computers were in touch with each other. 

"We've always held the ancient idea that a country is de- 
fined by physical borders. This petty nationality. There are 
new boundaries now being drawn through the networks of the 
computers — what startling nations they are — electronic coun- 
tries in which citizens are citizens of shared ideals and ac- 
tions. 

"The only way you can enslave a population is to cut off 
its communication or to control it. But just the opposite is hap- 
pening today. And so I breathe a little easier for the future of 
this country, knowing networks are growing and mushroom- 
ing as they are right now." 

The only other thing left for us to do then, by the word of 
Bach, is to seek out our most impractical dreams and grab at 
those crazy little chances that will spring up unexpectedly In 
our day-to-day lives. Find a gift to give, dare the adventure, 
and the wicker baskets and lemonade will be set before us on 
our way.

ELECTRONITURE 



FURNITURE FOR ELECTRONICS 



A PERFECT SYNTHESIS OF CRAFTSMANSHIP, 
HUMAN ENGINEEREsfG, AND AESTHETICS. 




The arts and sciences have finally combin- 
ed to produce a "home" for your computer 
system. The ELECTRONITURE™ com- 
puter desk — and matching printer stand — 
are made of solid oak (a welcome choice in 
this age of metal shelving and particle 
board carpentry). Attention to detail is ob- 
vious in the gently rounded edges, the 
precision hardware, the convenient 
hideaway work surface that glides out 
above the keyboard, the invisible West 
German couplings that give the assembled 
unit rock-solid stability, and the satin 
smooth hand rubbed oil finish. 

The best of two disciplines 

TTie design of the desk is a triumph of both 
form and function. As furniture, it is a 
handsome addition to home or of- 
fice—with classic lines that complement 
any room, any decor. As a functional com- 
puter work area, it brings order and effi- 
ciency to the system, comfort and con- 
venience to the user. 

Because the desk strictly adheres to the 
principles of Humanscale™ (the most 
sophisticated and thoroughly documented 
design parameters available for meeting 



the physical needs and 
capacities of human 
Ixings), you will find that 
your keyboard, monitor, 
and disk drives are always 
at the most comfortable 
operating distance and 
within the same focal 
range. Everything falls 
"naturally to hand" — 
thanks to science, not trial 
and error. 

Overall dimensions are 
suprisingly modest: 50" 
high, 44" wide, 29'/2" deep 
(printer stand is 2 5 ¥2" high, 
24" wide, 19" deep). Yet 
because the ELECTRONL 
TURE™ desk is designed 
from the ground up for 
technological applications, it easily ac- 
comodates modular type computers such 
as Apple II or III, IBM P/C, Atari 400 or 
800, and their peripherals. The monitor 
cabinet handles monitors up to ISVi" high, 
30" wide, 16" deep. Disk drives and soft- 
ware can be placed in the cabinet beside the 
monitor. Most 80-column dot matrix 
printers can fit next to the computer, while 
larger printers can be accomodated on the 
printer stand. 

The optics, alone, make the desk well 
worth the investment. 

The oak door in front of the monitor is in- 
set with non-glare glass originally 
developed for NASA. This glass has anti- 
reflectant coatings and a neutraL density 
filter. The anti-reflective coatings minimize 
the eye fatigue associated with trying to 
focus on your monitor's display through 
ambient reflections. The neutral density 



filter maximizes character definition and 
enhances color displays— without distort- 
ing the image or the colors. The coatings 
are unaffected by temperature or humidity 
and are virtually abrasion proof.

PUT ONE OVER 
ON APPLE II. ^ 



The Apple II Support System. 



Station II. 




What happens when you put one over on Apple II? You 
make it better. Because Station II organizes, simplifies, 
protects, secures and lets you control access to your 
Apple. In other words, it makes your Apple II y our 
personal computer, 

rrS DESIGNED FOR n-GETHERNES& 

Station II is designed specifically for Apple II by 
design consultants to Apple Com- 
puter. It pulls your Apple and peri- 
pherals together into an attractive, easy- 
to-use, integrated system. 

Your Apple is free to slide in and out, so 
there's no unstacking and restacking peri- 
pherals everytime you need to get inside, 
And you can choose the distance from 
keyboard to monitor that's most com- 
fortable for you. Station II even posi- 
tions your monitor at just the right 
angle for maximum viewing 
ease. 

IT CLEARS YOUR DESK OF 
CORDS AND CABLES. 

Station II is equipped 
with three built-in power 
outlets, so the cords and 
cables that normally clutter 
your work area are tucked away neatly 
inside. Now one cord, Station II's own, 
powers your entire system. 

Apple and Apple II are registered trademarks of Apple Computer. 






THE KEY IS SECURITY 

AND CONVENIENCE. 

You're not the only one who's 
discovered the value of 
Apple II, so Station II has a key. 
And a lock. And two ways to 
secure it. Now you can slide your 
Apple inside, lock it and leave it. 
Safe and sound. It puts the clamps on 
theft, and beyond that, you control 
who gets inside your Apple and who 
doesn't. 

Your programs are safe, too. Because 
Station II has a hne voltage surge sup- 

Eressor, ready to intercept power surges 
efore they can v^pe out your program. 
What's more, the key means conven- 
j ience. With one twist 
^ of the wrist you can 
power up your entire ' 
system. Plus, you can lock 
your Apple "on" or "off." 
rr MAKES YOUR APPLE 
MORE FRUITFUL. 
That's what happens when you put 
one over on Apple II. So look for 
Station II at your computer dealer.

thing like that." 

Such a development appeals to Smith 
for the simple reason that he is a satis- 
fied Screenwriter customer. He likes the 
service, the relatively modest asking 
price, the compatibility of its command 
format with the IBM 370 and, of course, 
that soft-set character feature that has 
allowed him to process manuscripts, text 
books, presentations and course work in 
a number of languages. 

But that, as the midway barker says, 
is not all. "ScreenWriter is one of the 
only word processors that will allow you 
to have a file larger than memory," says 
Smith. "The only other one that has that 
feature is WordStar, which costs more. 
Then, too, there's the fact you don't have 
to invest in an eighty-column board, since 
Screenwriter provides both upper case 
and lower case without one." 

Smith considers the latter a particu- 
lar blessing, since it has been his experi- 
ence 80-column boards give more pain 
than relief. "They sometimes cause prob- 
lems with other programs, and you 
actually have to rewrite some of them 
when you go into the 80-column mode." 
As it is, the reinventor of the Chinese 
typewriter says he prefers to work in 40- 
column anyway, toggling over to the sys- 
tem's 70-column option whenever he 
wants to check print formats. 

A Combination of Factors. Many who 
listen to Smith's word processing saga 
eventually ask the inevitable question: If 
Chinese is so complicated, why not sub- 
stitute a simpler, Romanized alphabet? 
Advocates of Pinyin, as this streamlin- 
ing approach is called, claim it would 
modernize the language, making it easi- 
er to teach, update, and, of course, com- 
puterize. Chinese science students often 
complain that they spend more time de- 
ciphering new characters than they do 
learning their disciplines. To accommo- 
date such twentieth-century marvels as 
the computer and the robot, the Chinese 
don't so much invent a new word as re- 
combine existing characters. The Man- 
darin term for computer, for example, is 
"electric calculator." 

"The official dialect of Mandarin only 
has 418 different sounds." Smith ex- 
plains. "If you go to a Romanized system, 
it creates a problem, because you have 
no way of telling what one particular 
sound might mean. It could have many 
meanings, like the Romanized sound of 
'shr.' It can have forty of fifty different 
meanings and then when you add the four 
different tones on top of that, it creates a 
great many problems." 

As Smith and other language special- 
ists point out, the modernization of Chi- 
nese is as much a political and cultural Is- 
sue as a linguistic one. Chinese thought is 
so bound up with the characters, says 
Smith, he doubts they will ever be aban- 
doned, as Pinyin advocates within the 
ruling Chinese Communist Party have 
learned. It is customary in the West to 




think of China as a cultural monolith, but 
closer examination reveals it is anything 
but that. 

"There are five major dialect groups 
and they have more spoken differences 
than French, Spanish, and Italian," says 
Smith. What holds this nation together, 
what certifies their Chinese identity, is 
the written language. It is both their link 
with each other and the past, a past rich 



in literary classics that would be lost to 
future generations if the written lan- 
guage was debased. 

The Price of Relevance. The major 
task as Smith sees it, is raising Ameri- 
ca's language-consciousness. Foreign 
language instruction was one of the 
prime educational casualties of the 
turbulent sixties. This was a time when 
people were getting it together, getting 
relevant, and dropping language re- 
quirements in high schools and colleges. 
The economy had yet to be savaged by 
the Vietnam war, Ford had its Mustang, 
and short-sighted accountants every- 
where had their bottom lines. 

"And then, within a decade, the bot- 
tom started falling out. The world was 
becoming increasingly interdependent, 
communication satellites were rewiring 
the globe, and our leader, former presi- 
dent Jimmy Carter, was putting his foot 
in his mouth in Poland. During a state 
visit, an attempt to tell the Poles of his 
eagerness 'to learn your opinions and \m- 
derstand your desires' was rendered his- 
torical by a translation that came out, 'I 
desire the Poles carnally.' " 

Such stories might be funnier if they 
weren't so sad, betraying, as they do, 
what Smith regards as a serious educa- 
tional shortcoming. "We're facing the 
same problem the English faced when 
they were a world power, the 'I speak En- 
glish, you speak English' sort of thing. If

BV lOriATHAn MILLER 



Call it fate or opportunity seized, but Apple inventor 
Stephen Wozniak has a plane crash and a brainstorm to thank 
for his latest milestones — graduation from the University of 
California at Berkeley and a second career as a promoter of 
rock and computer fairs. 

As Wozniak tells it, he was at the controls of a private plane 
about a year ago, flying from San Jose to San Diego to collect 
the wedding rings for his then upcoming marriage. For rea- 
sons still unexplained, the craft decided to merge with Mother 
Earth just after takeoff, leaving pilot Wozniak with a busted 
tooth and a busted memory. Five weeks after the fact, the 
whiz with ROMs and RAMs realized he'd been suffering from 
amnesia. Even more surprising, it seemed to be just what the 
doctor of destiny ordered. 

Amnesia to Apple to Alias. "Things were pretty intense at 
Apple back then," the bearded Wozniak explained while din- 
ing at a Berkeley pizzeria not far from his off-campus apart- 
ment. "They had certain expectations of me and of what and 
who I am. Also, I had to read memos and go to meetings, and 
do all this stuff that was fairly easy but time consuming. I 
wasn't getting down to the problem solving I loved. 

"And then I had the plane crash. I'd been off work for five 
weeks and I said, 'Perfect! There's no way I'm going back. I'm 
taking a year off and combining it with school.' " 

Assuming the alias of Rocky Clark (he has a Siberian husky 
named Rocky and a wife with the maiden name of Clark), 
thirtyish Steve Wozniak, merry prankster of blue-box fame, re- 
turned to the school he'd dropped out of ten years earlier to 
pursue his computer passion. He didn't need a degree in com- 
puter science and electrical engineering for itself, and certain- 
ly not for career advancement, he conceded. But it would be 
nice, and certainly neat, to be able to tell your kids — he and his 
wife are expecting a child in September— that you'd gradu- 
ated from college. 

Returning to school after a ten-year absence has been an 
education for Wozniak in more ways than one. He's found it a 
lot harder than he figured; he's routinely up until two a.m. and 
sometimes all night. He's determined that academic comput- 
er instruction inhibits creative problem solving and, heresy of 
heresies, has concluded that computers are not a student's 
godsend, at least not yet. 

"The computer cost me a ton of time in school. I felt that 
since I have a computer, I have to use it, so I used the word 
processor for my homework. It was much slower using the 
computer and that's the truth, and I don't care what anyone 
says. Computers have to get a lot simpler to use." 

Computer Illiterate? According to Wozniak, the culprit is 
word processing. While his fellow classmates were finishing 
assignments by hand in a couple of hours, Wozniak was fid- 
dling around with margins, reading proofs, and making cor- 
rections, because some words had to be in bold face and some 
in red ink. 

"I went through so much using it that I would spend eight 
hours where everyone else would spend two. I get every word 
processor that comes out and no one has written one for the Ap- 
ple that's any good at all. Superscribe"— Screenwriter— 
"comes closest. Format II isn't close and Executive Secretary 
isn't close and Easy Writer is the worst and Apple Pie is un- 



usable. Nothing has been any good. Apple Writer II is not good 
even. It doesn't do what WordStar does. There are none. You 
have to go CP/M and I'm mad. Everyone of them claims to be 
so great. They're all complicated, they're hard, they don't do 
very much, and they don't work with many printers." 

If Wozniak has reservations — to put it mildly — about word 
processing, he's decidedly more upbeat in his evaluation of his 
alma mater. Ten years ago, circa the Cambodian incursion 
when Wozniak was striking snapshot poses beside smoking 
tear gas canisters, students had only one thing on their 
minds — the war. Looking back, says Wozniak, it's obvious the 
war did more than tear the country apart ; it distorted college 
educations as well. Today, swelling ranks of conservative busi- 
ness and engineering majors are positively directed toward, 
as Wozniak puts it, "earning money for life." The inspiration- 
al symbol of Berkeley in the eighties is that of paraplegics and 
quadraplegics tooling around the hilly East Bay campus in 
their Jennings motorized wheelchairs — of people, in short, get- 
ting on with the business of living. 

Changing Subject. Cory Hall, the engineering building 
where Wozniak took most of his classes this past year, looks 
very much as it did in 1970, but the instruction in computer sci- 
ence doesn't. The computers were new; now, they've become a 
part of the bureaucratic problem. 

"Back then," Wozniak explains, "they were teaching by 
saying, 'Here are some problems, find a solution.' They were 
teaching techniques that would lead you to find a solution. Now 
they're teaching the complete solution. It's not as creative as it 
used to be. A lot of good or alternative solutions get passed 
over." 

But Wozniak isn't down on education; far from it. He's an 
optimist with seemingly boundless faith in the young and in the 
self-teachability of computer technology. 

"The kids are getting so far ahead of people like me," mar- 
vels Wozniak. "When you're young, you can learn as many lan- 
guages as you're brought up with, and computer just happens 
to be one of them. It's incredible to see so many people get 
down to the instruction-set level, bit by bit, and understand it so 
thoroughly. They've learned, they've educated themselves, 
just by studying what they could and playing tricks with it." 

Computers are ideal learning machines, according to Woz- 
niak, because they give you feedback. It's the constant repeti- 
tion, the over and over, the backtracking on your own, the re- 
covering from errors. "And," he says, extrapolating uni- 
versally, "repetition seems to be the biggest factor in any- 
thing, whether it's winning the Olympics or designing a 
computer." 

An Apple for the Student. For youngsters, the problem isn't 
designing computers, it's getting their curious little hands on 
them. Which brings us to Apple's offer to give every primary 
and secondary school in the country a bright, shiny Apple, pro- 
vided Congress goes along with a modest tax bill to offset the 
giveaway partially. 

"It's more important for children to get a good education in 
elementary school, and yet that's where the least money 
goes," Wozniak stumps. "Universities get tons of donations, 
fancy computers, and all sorts of tax write-offs that don't apply 
to lower grades. And that's wrong."

Giving computers away could pay off for Apple one day. To 
Wozniak, it's merely something he likes doing. An unpreten- 
tious multimillionaire If ever there was one, Wozniak is gener- 
ous with his time and often with his money. His generosity 
and openness are evident in his development of Apples I and II. 
He built them for the problem-solving fun of it, to be shared 
with fellow hobbyists in the Silicon Valley's Home Brew Com- 
puter Club. It took the marketing insight of Steve Jobs, Woznl- 
ak's partner in pranks and computers, to see the commercial 
potential. 

"I wanted an instruction set I could play with and that's all I 
wanted," Wozniak recalls of the inception of the first Apple. 
"That meant a printed circuit board on the floor, some wires 
connected to a keyboard, and a monitor." When it came to the 
Apple II, which Wozniak also designed, he still wasn't thinking 
product, but trjing to solve another problem — putting some 
color on the machine. 

Open Roads Go Two Ways. The genesis of the I and II as 
noncommercial designs proved, ultimately, to be a commer- 
cial blessing, since it led to the opening of the Monitor pro- 
gram to would-be software peripheral designers. "We didn't 
have enough software to write a complicated operating sys- 
tem at this stage," Wozniak says. "Since there wasn't any- 
thing in existence, we had to give access to the Monitor." 
Given his hobbyist disposition, Wozniak would have liked to 
have seen the III opened through to the Monitor and all the list- 
ings given out, but several factors conspired against it — among 
them, the numerous inquiries concerning weird calls to the 
Monitor, expected by experience with the II, and a lack of in- 
terest in the system's openness on the part of potential busi- 
ness users. Having to concede compromises like this added 
much to the impetus Wozniak felt to lay back about business 
and return to school. With the degree as good as gotten, it came 
time to look ahead again. 

The Biggest Bash of All. It was last summer when Wozniak 
was tidying up academic accounts, taking time to get in touch

with himself and his ideals, that an idea occurred to him and 
wouldn't rest. Why not combine a computer fair and a musical 
festival on the order of a Woodstock — sans the drug^, of course, 
and the ripoffs and the lack of planning? Throw it on a three- 
day weekend and add activities for participation and you've 
got just the kind of wild and crazy notion that would excite the 
public imagination and dyed-in-the-wool computer hobbyists 
like himself. 

The idea soon evolved, with input from promoters and edu- 
cators, into UNUSON Corporation, founded by Wozniak last 
August to produce educational computer materials, develop a 
national data computer network, and run the fair. UNUSON 
preaches the upbeat technological gospel of the eighties that 
home and school computers can bring people together by rev- 
olutionizing the nation's information and education systems. 
Its fair in Devore, California, this Labor Day weekend, dubbed 
the Us Festival, is meant to usher in a new decade of dedica- 
tion in which computer-literate people, recalling the cadences 
of John F. Kennedy, will ask, "What's in it for us?" before ask- 
ing, "What's in it for me?" 

"I want to make it big and I'm one of the few people who 
can do it." Wozniak's excited voice rises above the pizzeria din. 
"I really don't care about the bottom line. Sure, I hope to break 
even, but it's got to be done right and it's got to be done well." 

By doing it right, Wozniak means having thirty top-name 
musical groups (rock, country western, and folk — no anti- 
social punk); attracting upward of a half- million visitors; 
providing comprehensive facilities for accommodations, in- 
cluding ample power sources and camping facilities ; and top- 
ping it all off with the biggest computer fair ever. The fair 
would feature problem-solving competitions between individ- 
uals, groups, and brands of personal computers; hardware 
and software exhibits ; and demonstrations of exciting new ap- 
plications of computer technology in communications, educa- 
tion, small business, music, and ecology. 

For hobbyist Wozniak, the paramount concern of the mo- 
ment — short of finishing his school work — is getting word of the 
festival out to computer club soulmates and other users. To 
that end, he is offering Softalk readers and other Apple owners 
the opportunity to make reservations beginning June 1, a 
month before tickets go on sale to the general public. (See the 
accompanying announcement for details.) 

Simplicity of Things To Come. A lot of calls to the Monitor 
have hummed along circuit boards since Apple's inception, but 
Stephen Wozniak remains virtually unchanged. Wiser, of 
course, but no less committed to the technological gospel that 
denies the zero sum paradigm that one man's gain is another 
man's loss.

"A lot of people tend to think that way about everything," 
says Woznlak, "but I relate to that from a different point of 
view, that there are a lot of cases of somebody doing some- 
thing really well, where everyone wins out. I'd say Apple is a 
good example of that, that technology is benefiting everyone. I 



think people get rich because they make poorer people richer." 

As to the glorious future, inventor Woznlak is playing mum. 
He's got ideas on software, hardware, and even cpus, but 
many are off-the-wall type things. "Whatever I do," he con- 
fides, "it has to feel good." What will make him feel good, and 
also sell, he strongly believes, is a product that's a whole lot 
simpler to use than anything available today. 

"Computers have to be easier. Computers aren't easy, Ap- 
ples aren't easy. They're very hard to use. It's hard to pick up a 
manual for any major word processor — command this, com- 
mand that— and that's got to change. I believe Apple's going to 
be the leader in that revolution. It's going to become so easy, 
you'll know what to do without reading the manual." 

Such breakthroughs may or may not be unveiled at the Us 
Festival, but for Steve Wozniak 1982 is looking like a very good 
year. He's turned 1981 's plane crash into wide-ranging oppor- 
tunities, and come the end of September he'll celebrate the 
birth of his first child. "I get to name the baby if it's a boy," 
says the man who's toying with Karp, Rocky, and leaning to 
Clark, as in Kent. "Like I said, I like simple solutions."

STOP 



PLAYING GAMES WITH 
YOUR RESOURCES ! 



Was financial management one of your justifications 
for purchasing an APPLE™ computer? 

Are you really managing your Tinances or just using an 
expensive calculator to help balance your checkbook(s)? 

It takes a double entry system to do the job right. Why ? 

Less than half the financial transactions necessary to 
adequately manage your resources and plan your tax 
strategy can be accomodated with single entry systems. 

How can you use a double entry system without a 
refresher course in accounting? 

You can't, if you use software that simply automates 
the way people do things by hand, . . . but, with 
The ACCOUNTANT, by Decision Support Software, 
the power of your computer is harnessed to offer you the 
advantages of an automated double entry system even if 
you don't know a debit from a credit ! 

'BEST PACKAGE EVALUATED' 
"For the home user (and perhaps in some 
less complex small business), the best package 
we evaluated was the Accountant by Decision 
Support Software." 

— Mind Your Business Dept., Softalk, Jan. 82 

Our users are equally impressed: 

"The ACCOUNTANT is not only very sophisticated 
and full of surprising features, such as automatic 
transactions and linkages to VisiCalc", but is very 
easy to use". 




The ACCOUNTANT includes 


these user oriented features: 


• 


Menu driven 




operations 


• 


Comprehensive 




prompting 


• 


User defined 




account names 


• 


User defined 




code names 


•

The ACCOUNTANT 
Finance Data Base System 

The ACCOUNTANT is a decision support tool that 
provides an individual or business with timely, accurate 
data to plan, monitor and control their finances. The 
detailed records contained in The ACCOUNTANT'S data 
base will enable you to itemize each and every legitimate 
tax deduction. DBCALC, a VisiCalc" interface, retrieves 
data from The ACCOUNTANT'S data base and creates 
a VisiCalc " file of actual and projected flnancial data 
which can be used for financial simulations and tax 
computations. 

The ACCOUNTANT requires an APPLE II 
with 48K, APPLESOFT and single or dual drives. The 
system includes a master disk and a newly released utility 
disk (both in standard DOS 3.3 format), hardware key, 
and a comprehensive, easy to follow user's guide in an 
attractive binder $129 

DBCALC (with 1040 model included) 
requires VisiCalc " $20

Tools of the Craft, Part 12 



Old Business: Last Month's Challenges. Here's hoping you 
spent at least part of this past month working on the exercises 
that were provided for your amusement. Before moving on to 
anything else, here are solutions to those problems: 

1. You were asked to rewrite the function Yes, which we de- 
veloped last time, to eliminate its dependency on Capital, an- 
other function that already dwells within your Pascal tool kit if 
you've been keeping up with the Path. This was an easy prob- 
lem (we think) ; here is one solution, which involves replacing 
the call to Capital with actual Pascal code that performs capi- 
talization : 



FUNCTION 

Yes 

:Boolean; 
(* Waits for case-independent 

'Y' or "N' response from 

console keyboard, and returns 

True as function value for 

T, False for 'N.' <RETURN> 

is taken as equivalent to "N.' 

THIS VERSION IS INDEPENDENT OF 

ANY OTHER PROCEDURE OR FUNCTION. 

VAR 
Ch 

:Char; 
BEGIN (* Yes *) 
REPEAT 
Read(Ch); 

(* AT THIS POINT, OLD VERSION INCLUDED 
THIS LINE: 
Ch := Capital(Ch); 

*) 

(* THE FOLLOV/ING CODE REPLACES THE ABOVE: *) 

IF ((Ch >= 'a') OR (Ch <= V)) 
THEN 

Ch := Chr(Ord(Ch) - Ord(a') + OrdCA')); 
IF EOLn {* <RETURN> pressed *) 
THEN 
BEGIN 

Ch := 'N'; (* V/as blank *) 

Write('N');{* Blank was echoed by Pascal *) 

END; 

UNTIL ((Ch = T) OR (Ch = "N')); 
(* Got response, now report it! *) 
CASE Ch OF 

BEGIN 



Write("es'); {* Finish "Yes" *) 
Yes := True; 

END; 

'N': 
BEGIN 

Write("o'); (* Finish "No" *) 
Yes := False; 

END; 

END (* CASE Ch *); 
V/riteLn; 
END (* Yes *); 

2. Next, you were challenged to rewrite last month's Echo- 
ASCII program so that it would cease execution not on receipt 
of an at sign (@) , as in the original version, but whenever the 
user pressed control-C. As you'll remember, the average Pas- 
cal program has only one way to determine whether or not the 
user presses control-C, and that is to read a character and 
then, if the character read is blank, to examine the value of the 
built-in function EOF. An EOF value of True at this point im- 
plies that the "blank" received by the program actually corre- 
sponds to a control-C, the "end of file" character for Apple 
Pascal's console device. Here's the new version of Echo- 
ASCII, which uses EOF to satisfy the new specification: 

PROGRAM 

EchoASCIIVersion2; 
(* Reports the ASCII Integer value of 

each character typed at the keyboard, 

until user presses control-C 

*) 

CONST 

Blank= ' '; 
VAR 

Ch 

:Char; 

BEGIN {* EchoASCIIVersion2 *) 
REPEAT 
Read(Ch); 

WriteLn(Blank, Ord(Ch)); 
UNTIL ( (Ch = Blank) AND EOF (* Confrol-C *) ); 
END (* EchoASCIIVersion2 *). 



3. F'inally, we asked the hardy reader to write a program 
that guesses, using the function Yes in an interactive dialogue, 
an integer number between 0 and 20 which the user has in 



JUNE 1982 



147 



mind. The Guess program, shown below, uses a simple strate- 
gy: It starts out by assuming that the user's number can be 
taken from the entire specified range of numbers. It then asks 
a series of carefully formulated questions. With each answer, 
the program is able to whittle the range of possible numbers 
down to about half its previous size, until the range shrinks to 
exactly one. That one remaining number should be the one 
chosen by the user, provided that the user is always honest in 
answering the program's yes or no questions. (As you'll see, 
this program recognizes, but tolerates, inconsistent or dishon- 
est users!) 

PROGRAM 
Guess; 

{* Plays a guessing game with the user; 
to see how to play, read the WriteLn 
statements in "PROCEDURE Instructions." 



CONST

LowBound, {* At any time, number cannot be less. *) 
HighBound, (* At any time, number cannot be more. *) 
MidPoint (* Of the range LowBound . . HighBound. *) 
:lnteger; 
FUNCTION 
Capital(Ch 

:Char) 

:Char; 

(* Return Ch, converted to upper case 
(capital) if Ch is lower case. 

*) 

BEGIN (* Capital *) 

Capital := Ch; (* No change unless lowercase *) 
IF ((Ch >= V) AND (Ch <= V)) 

THEN (* Ifs a lower-case letter — transform it! *) 
Capital := Chr(Ord(Ch) - OrdOo') + Ord^A')); 



(* Otherwise, it's not a lower-case letter, 
so leave it alone. 

*) 

END (* Capital *); 
FUNCTION 
Yes 

:Boolean; 
(* Waits for case-independent 

'Y' or 'N' response from 

console keyboard, and returns 

True as function value for 

T, False for ~N.' <RETURN>

must be declared prior to 
this function!

Let Us Stuff You with Apples and 
We'll Help Pay for a College Education 



Jim Ganz is a high school senior from West Hartford, Connecticut, and a Soffdisk subscriber. 

He wrote an Applesoft program called Recipe. File that stores recipes on diskette. 

Sofidiik asked subscribers to send in their favorite apple recipes. 
The result is a cookbook on diskette full of ways to prepare apples (the eating kind). 

The July issue of Softdisk will include the apple cookbook on a separate disk as a bonus. For each order received before July 1, 
1982, Softdisk will send Gonz $2.00 pocket money for college next fall. 

Help put the next Budge through college and enjoy the American way of life with the opple cookbook. 

Softdisk is an interactive monthly publication contained entirely on a two-sided floppy disk. Subscription cost is $10 for the first 
issue ordered and $5 per subsequent issue when the previous diskette is returned. 

To order, send $10 to:

Notice that this program did more than the assignment re- 
quired, letting the human player specify the upper limit, in- 
stead of fixing it at 20. Also, if you enter, compile, and run this 
program, you'll note that its guessing strategry is somewhat 
different than that implied by the "sample program output" 
that was presented as a model for you last time. The program 
that mirrors that output is less efficient and slightly more dif- 
ficult to explain than the one shown here. If you took the time to 
develop a program according to last month's model, and would 
like it verified, feel free to send a listing. Remember that your 
program need not conform to the example, a variety of cor- 
rect solutions were possible. Anyone whose Guess program dif- 
fers substantially from this one is invited to send a listing for 
verification and critique. Send all listings to Jim Merritt, in 
care of Softalk magazine. 
Advanced Input and Output: Files 

If you've succeeded in completing the last batch of exer- 
cises, then you've followed the Pascal Path to a mastery of the 
simplest input and output mechanisms offered by Apple Pas- 
cal. To be specific, you can now write programs that use the 
built-in procedures Read and ReadLn to acquire numeric and 
character data from the console keyboard, while emplojring 
Write and WriteLn to display such data on the console screen. 
Now, it's time to move ahead and learn to store data on, and 
retrieve it from, floppy disk, as well as how to move informa- 
tion between your Apple and your printer, modem, or other pe- 
ripheral devices. 

What Is a File? In all but the most exceptional cases, Apple 
Pascal programs collect input data from (and can also deposit 
output data into) objects called files. According to the classi- 
cal Pascal definition, a file is an indefinitely (but not infinite- 
ly) long sequence of data items, all of which share the same 
data type. For instance, a Pascal file might consist of a se- 
quence of characters, or a sequence of Integers, or a sequence 
of Booleans, but not a random intermingling of characters. In- 
tegers, and Booleans. 

Files resemble pipelines insofar as your programs are con- 
cerned. You may consider the program as sitting at one end of 
the pipe, accepting input data as it plops out, one item at a 
time; or shoving output data into (and down) the pipe, datum 
by datum. Output data that is sent down the pipeline by a pro- 
gram eventually emerges, in the exact order of transmission, 
at its final destination. This might be a floppy disk, a hard disk, 
or the display of a CRT terminal, for example. 

The console is treated by Pascal as a file, as is any other in- 
teractive input /output device that is hooked into the system. 
Information on disk is also organized in the form of files. The 
console device and a disk file certainly have many differences 
between them, but they have at least one characteristic in 
common: you can acquire input data from either of them, one 
unit at a time, in sequence, and you can transmit output data to 
either of them in the same fashion. 

To a Pascal program, a file is a variable, albeit one with 
special properties. Here are declarations for three files, CFile, 
BFile, and IFile. The type of data each can hold rtiould be ob- 
vious from its declaration: 

VAR 
CFile 

:FILE OF Char; 

BFile 

:FILE OF Boolean; 
IFile 

:FILE OF Integer;

Pascal syntax to declare file variables is remarkably like 
plain English. To indicate that a variable is a file containing 
items of type T, you simply declare it as being a "FILE OF T." 
The examples given earlier fit this pattern, which is rendered 
as a railroad diagp^am in figure 1. Note that a declaration such 
as "FILE OF T" is a type descriptor, just like the identifiers 
Boolean and Char, or the enumeration (Red, Yellow, Blue). 
This means that not only can you declare variables to be files, 
but you can also declare your own file tjrpes. To illustrate this 
principle, let's declare CFile, BFile, and IFlle again. Note that 
CFile remains a FILE OF Char, BFile remains a FILE OF 
Boolean, and IFile remains a FILE OF Integer.

CharFile = 

FILE OF Char; 

BoolFile =

Apple Pascal predeclares to file types for you. Text and In- 
teractive. A Text file is exactly the same as a FILE OF Char, 
and the two type descriptions are synonymous in Apple Pas- 
cal. So, whenever you see the identifier Text used as a type de- 
scriptor, you may mentally translate it into FILE OF Char, and 
vice versa. An Interactive file is also considered to be a se- 
quence of characters, but it isn't quite the same as a FILE OF 
Char. This month we'll study regular Text files, leaving Inter- 
active files and non-Text files until our next excursion down the 
Path. 

Opening Files: Reset and Re Write. A file variable is the 
mechanism — ^the "window" — through which you gain access 
to the data in a physical file. A physical file corresponds to a 
magnetized area on disk or to an entire peripheral device, such 
as a printer or modem. Before attempting any access, your 
program must associate a file variable with a physical file. 

The Apple Pascal operating system acts as an intermedi- 
ary between your program and a physical file. That is, in or- 
der to access a given physical file, your program must notify 
the operating system of its intentions ; the operating system — if 
it can — responds by opening and maintaining the necessary 
links and communications pathways. All these links and path- 
ways lead into or away from the file variable. 

The operating system knows each physical file by its file 
name. You have been using file names ever since we took our 
first steps along the Pascal Path ; these are the names that you 
give to the Editor in order to recall or store text, to the com- 
piler in order to compile a program, or to the operating sys- 
tem in order to execute a program. 

To associate a file variable with a physical file, you issue a 
call to one of the built-in procedures Reset or Re Write, whose

syntax diagrams are given in figure 2. Either procedure re- 
ceives two parameters. First is the identifier for the file vari- 
able. Second, is a character string. Reset and Re Write cause 
the Pascal system to associate the file variable with the physi- 
cal file whose file name is contained in the character string. 
This association process is known as opening the file. Reset 
opens an existing physical file, through the specified file vari- 
able, for the purpose of input. Once Reset has been called, your 
program may get data from a file. Re Write opens a physical 
file, which may or may not already exist, for the purpose of 
output. If the physical file does not already exist, Re Write 
creates it for you. If the physical file does exist when Re Write 
is called, it is erased completely, if possible (so, be careful 
when using Re Write ! ) . After a call to Re Write, your program 
may put data into a file. 

Except in special, highly controlled situations, you should 
not try to get input data from any file into which you are also 
writing data, and vice versa. Apple Pascal enforces this phi- 
losophy by prohibiting you from reopening a file that is al- 
ready open. The following code, for example, is illegal in Ap- 
ple Pascal (though the compiler voill permit it) : 

(* ILLEGAL PASCAL — RESULTS IN RUN-TIME ERROR ♦) 
(* Open file for reading *) 

Reset(CFile, "INDY500.TEXT'); 
(* Now, open it for writing, too *) 

ReWrite(CFile, "INDYSOO.TEXT'); 

Apple Pascal recognizes this error condition not at com- 
pile-time, but at run-time (execution time) , and informs you of 
"I/O Error #12," ("File not closed"). The call to Reset opens 
CFile. The subsequent call to Re Write is, to Pascal, another at- 
tempt to open CFile. Because CFile is already open (not 
closed) , the second open operation must — and does — fail. 

Don't make the common mistake of assuming that there is 
any relationship between the name of a file variable and the 
name of the physical file to which it may be associated at a 
given instant. For example, you may declare Source as a Text 
variable, but you need not associate it with a physical file 
named SOURCE. TEXT. On the other hand, you're free to do 
so, if you wish. The name of the variable and the name of the 
physical file are entirely independent, in much the same way 
that the name of an Integer variable remains separate and dls-

tinct from the contents of that variable. 

Closing Files. Suppose a program declares a file variable, 
opens the file, and proceeds to access it. What happens to the 
physical file when the program ends? We might also ask the 
same question about the physical file that is associated with a 
file variable which is local to a certain procedure or function. 
What happens when the procedure or function ends? 

If the file was opened for reading — in other words, if Reset 
was used to open the file — nothing happens on exit from a pro- 
cedure, function, or program. The physical file and its con- 
tents remain unchanged. However, if the file was opened for 
writing (with Re Write), one of two things may happen. If the 
file was newly created by the Re Write, it disappears at the end 
of the procedure, function, or program that uses it. If the file 
existed prior to the Re Write, any changes made to it are for- 
gotten ; the physical file reverts to the state it was in prior to 
the Rewrite. 

A newly created file, or changes to an existing one, can be- 
come permanent only if you use the built-in procedure Close. 
Close takes as its first (and perhaps only) argument a file var- 
iable identifier. An optional second argument determines the 
fate of the physical file. To illustrate, let's assume you have 
opened a file variable named FVar. Then, Close (FVar), 
Close (FVar, NORMAL), Close (FVar, LOCK), and 
Close (FVar, PURGE) all mark FVar as being closed. This 
means that FVar is free to be opened again, later during pro- 
gram execution, and may even be associated with an entirely 
different physical file the next time around. Beyond this, the 
only difference between these several calls to Close is in the 
way each handles the disposal of the physical file linked to 
FVar. As far as the physical file is concerned, Close (FVar) 
and Close (FVar, LOCK) are identical to no Close at all, as de- 
scribed in the last paragraph. Close (FVar, LOCK) makes a 
new file — or recent changes in an existing file — permanent. 
Close (FVar, PURGE) results in the destruction of the physi- 
cal file that is linked with FVar. 

Note that the option names NORMAL, LOCK, and PURGE 
need not be completely capitalized, as they are shown here. 
Feel free to use lower case, or a mixture of the two, in specify- 
ing Close options. 

Old Dogs Learn New Tricks. In a previous jaunt down the 
Path, we used the built-in function EOF to test for the (logical) 
end of the standard input character stream, which occurs 
when someone presses control-C on the keyboard. EOF also 
works for other files, but to use EOF to check the status of any 
file, other than the standard input, you must supply the func- 
tion with an argument: a file variable identifier. For example, 
EOF(CFile) will be True as soon as the last datum has been 
read from the physical file that is associated with the file vari- 
able CFile. 

The built-in function EOLn, and the procedures Read, 
ReadLn, Write, and WriteLn, also accept a file variable identi- 
fier (declared as Text, Interactive, or FILE OF Char) as their 
optional first — or only — argument. Without it, they deal with 
the standard input or output; with it, they apply to the physi- 
cal file that is associated with the specified file variable. They 
will not, however, work with files that store other types of data 
(Integer or Boolean, for example). Of the built-in file-oriented 
procedures and functions we have studied so far, only Reset, 
Rewrite, Close, and EOF work for all files. 

Let's look at some examples that illustrate the concepts just 
presented. Suppose CFile has been declared as type Text. 
Then, EOLn (CFile) will be True at the end of any text lines 
within CFile. If IntNum is an Integer variable, then 
Read(CFile, IntNum) acquires the value of IntNum from the 
file associated with CFile, while Read(IntNum) acquires Int- 
Num's value from the console. WriteLn (OutFile) sends a 
blank line to the physical file associated with OutFile. Read- 
Ln (MyFlle) forces Pascal to skip to the end of the current line 
in the file associated with the variable My File, then to prepare 
to acquire subsequent input from the following text line (as- 
suming, of course, that both OutFile and My File are declared 
as Text, Interactive, or FILE OF Char). 



A File Lister. Here is a program that lists its own source 
file: 

PROGRAM 
Lister 1; 

(* Display the contents of file LISTER 1. TEXT 
on the console screen 

*) 

VAR 
Source 

:FILE OF Char; 

Ch 

:Char; 
BEGIN (* Listerl *) 

Reset(Source, LISTER 1 .TEXT'); 
WHILE (NOT EOF{Source)) DO 

BEGIN (* Get and display next line *) 
WHILE (NOT EOLn(Source)) DO 

BEGIN (* Get and display next char *) 
Read(Source, Ch); 
Write(Ch); (* To console *) 
END (* WHILE NOT EOLN *); 
(* Finish reading current line *) 

ReadLn(Source); 
(* Show end of line on console *) 
WriteLn; 
END (* WHILE NOT EOF *); 
(* No Close necessary, we were only reading. *) 
END (* Listerl *). 

Let's look closely, to see how Listerl works. First, it calls 
Reset, to associate the file variable Source with the physical 
(disk) file "LISTERl.TEXT." Reset assumes that "LIST- 
ER!. TEXT" exists; if you give the source program file a dif- 
ferent name and do not change the Reset call accordingly, 
Listerl may fail in its attempt to open Source, and you will 
receive an error message. Once Source has been opened, 
Listerl can get at the text that is stored in the physical file by 
going through Source. From this point on, Listerl simply 
scans the file, line by line (and character by character within a 
line), displaying each character on the console screen in turn 
until the scan reaches the end of the file. This strategy is em- 
bodied in two WHILE-loops, nested one inside the other. 

The body of the first loop corresponds to the acquisition and 
display of an entire line of text from Source, and is repeated so 
long as the end of the Source file has not been reached. The 
body of the inner loop gets a single character from Source and 
sends it to the console screen so long as the end of the line has 
not been reached. When the end of line occurs, the inner loop 
terminates, a call to ReadLn is issued in order to ready the pro- 
gram to read from Source's next text line, and the console's 
cursor is positioned at the start of a new display line by virtue 
of the call to WriteLn. 

Exercise 

Write a program named CopyText that copies the text in 
some physical file (for example, LISTERl.TEXT) into a 
physical file named CLONE. TEXT. After your program is fin- 
ished, you should be able to access CLONE.TEXT with the 
screen Editor. Next month's Pascal Path will Include a ver- 
sion of CopyText. Before you sit down at the keyboard to write 
this program, consider the following points: 

1. You will need to use file variables to solve this problem; 
how many are necessary, and what should their type(s) 
be? 

2. How should you open each of the file variables? Should 
you Close any of them? How? 

3. Can you use previously developed programs to solve 
part or all of your problem? If so, which, and how easy 
will it be to adapt it (or them) to the task at hand? 

4. Do you anticipate ever again using CopyText, or a pro- 
gram like it, perhaps on behalf of a different set of files? 
Might you ever need to include a file-copying function 
within a larger program? 




. . . Computer Portrait Subsystem for the Apple II 



Computer Station has put it all together. The 
portrait subsystem allows Apple II owners to 
create computer portraits that may be heat 
transferred to create customized T-shirts, 
posters, and other novelty items. The portrait 
system is now available for fun or profit. 

The Portrait Subsystem requires a 48K Apple II 
with Applesoft, one disk drive, game paddles, at 
least one monitor, and either an Epson MX-80 
printer with graphics option, or Centronics 739 
printer. The subsystem includes the means for 
creating the portrait on the screen by focusing a 
video camera on the subject. Two monitors are 



recommended to view the regular video on one 
and the digitized image on the other. The game 
paddles are used to control intensity and contrast 
so as to be able to create interesting effects as well 
as clear portraits. The composed digitized picture 
may be frozen on the screen at any time to view the 
finished result. The picture may also be saved to 
disk, if desired. The portrait software allows the 
digitized picture to be dumped to the printer by 
simply pressing the "P" key for print. Prior to prin- 
ting, the entire image is reversed on the screen so 
as to print a "mirror image" suitable for heat 
transfer. The printed picture is approximately 9 
1/2 by 8 inches. 



The entire portrait subsystem includes the 
Dithertizer II TM with video camera for input, the 
Station Master I M printer interface card with 
cable, portrait software, and starter supply set in- 
cluding special ribbons. Suggested retail for the 
Portrait Subsystem is $1175.00.

Applesoft Basic has some nice bullt-ln commands for using 
hi-res graphics. Although they're described in the Applesoft 
manual, a little repetition doesn't hurt. 

Each example used in the manual has a line number, as it 
would appear in a Basic progfram. The line numbers used are 
arbitrary, though. All the commands can also be used without 
line numbers as direct commands, so you don't even have to 
write a program to draw on the screen. 

The command hgr sets the display to show whatever is in 
the hi-res page 1 memory area (addresses 8192 to 16383) . It al- 
so clears the screen (sets all values in that address range to 
zero) and sets a pointer that tells all subsequent hi-res com- 
mands to draw on page 1. The syntax is: 

10 HGR 

Another command, hgr2, sets the display to show what's in 
hi-res page 2 (16384 to 24575) , clears the screen, and sets the 
draw pointer to page 2. You'd type it: 

10 HGR2 

Hcolor sets the color of subsequent draws and plots to the 
hi-res screen. Colors are: 



0— black 

1 — green 

2— violet 

3— white 



4— black 

5 — orange 

6 — blue 

7 — white 



Remember that white and black have twice the resolution 
of the other colors (280 dots across, as opposed to 140), and 
that colors from the left column may affect colors In the right 
column (and vice versa) when positioned close together hori- 
zontally (within the same byte). Here's how you set color: 

20 HCOLOR = 5 

Hplot x,y sets the point x,y to the current hcolor (the last 
one specified with an hcolor command) . Since hcolor sets only 
a single point, though, either white will appear as a different 
color. White3 will appear green if x is odd, and violet if x is 
even, and white? will be orange if x is odd, and blue if x is even. 
X can be from 0 to 279, with 0 being the left edge of the screen 
and 279 the right edge, and y can be from 0 to 191, with 0 the top 
and 191 the bottom of the screen. Any arithmetic expression 
can also be used for x and y, as long as the resulting values are 
in the ranges given. If not, you'll get an error in the program. 



30 HPLOT 30,120 
40 HPLOT R*2, (T- 



•5)/3 



Hplot xl, yl to x2, y2 draws a line from point xl,yl to 
point x2,j^ in the current hcolor. The same restrictions apply 
to the range of the x and y values as in the hplot x, y com- 
mand. The color restrictions of the Apple show when lines are 
vertical or near vertical. If both x values are the same and the 
hcolor is white, you'll get the same color results as explained 
with hploting a single point. If you try to draw a vertical orange 
or green line with the x value even, nothing will happen (since 
orange and green only appear in odd columns). Likewise, if 
you try to draw a vertical blue or violet line in an odd column. 



it won't work. Lines that are near vertical will often appear 
broken or in multiple colors for the same reasons. 

35 HPLOT 5,10 TO 260,180 

40 HPLOT 2*D,5+F TO 3-N,L/2 

Hplot to X, y draws a line from the last point specified in a 
previous hplot command to x,y. All the above comments about 
hplot commands apply. 

45 HPLOT TO 45,50 

50 HPLOT TO A+19,B-8 

The above Applesoft commands just outlined take care of 
setting the individual bytes in the hi-res screen area appropri- 
ately. Considering the examples in last month's column, in 
which we were poking values into various bytes of the hi-res 
screen, this is a real nice convenience. There are several hi-res 
commands dealing with Applesoft shape tables, too, but we'll 
talk about those later. In the meantime, here are a few pro- 
gram examples that use the hplot commands.

will not appear in white. Try changing white? to whites to see 
the results. Each program uses a slight variation on the hplot 
command to achieve the same result. Note that the usage in 
the third of the examples is legal and works just fine. 

Use of the hplot command also lends itself well to use of 
read and data in Applesoft. Figure 2 shows first a program for 
obtaining the same results in figure 1, then shows a program 
for a more complex figure. Notice that the variable / Is a count-

data statements. 

If you're into mathematics and want to play around a little 
with the coordinates, you can even read them into an array 
and perform some functions on them before plotting. For a few 
examples, see figure 3. A GOSUB was used for plotting the fig- 
ure so that it wouldn't have to be repeated for each example. In

There are other handy-dandy commands you can use from 
Basic to affect what's happening on the graphics screen. The 
most common ispofce -16302,0 (example: 20 POKE -16302,0), 
which clears the text from the bottom of the screen after you 
use hgr. To get the text back, use poke -16301,0. This is vir- 
tually irrelevant when you use hgr2, since the four lines of text 
at the bottom of the screen are associated with page 1 of hi-res 
graphics. To try it out, use poke -16302, 0 as line 15 of any of the 
sample programs above. 

Another command that you may find useful is call 62^54

recently hploted hcolor. Since the hgr commands clear the 
screen to black only, this is a way to choose a different back- 
ground color. To try it, use the following in any of the 
examples : 

18 HCOLOR = 6 : HPLOT 0,0 : CALL 62454 

A couple of other pofces affect the hi-res screen, and may be 
useful at one time or another. They are listed here only for ref- 
erence — if they don't sound useful to you now, just ignore 
them. 

You can use pokes to switch between hi-res graphics and 
text without clearing either screen (the hi-res graphics screens 
and the text screen are independent and are always updated in 
memory, even though they may not be displayed at the time) . 
Poke -16303,0 switches from graphics to text mode, and poke 
-1630'>t,0 switches from text to graphics mode. Neither clears the 
screen memory. Examples of using these are the hi-res ad- 
ventures from On-Line Systems and Adventure International 
that let you switch between viewing the text descriptions of a 
location and the hi-res picture of a location without erasing 
either screen. 

You can also switch between the two pages of graphics 
without erasing; poke -i6299,0 switches from page 1 to page 2, 
and poke -16300 switches from page 2 to page 1. 

Some good reference material to keep on hand for the vari- 
ous graphics pokes and calls are the Applesoft Reference 
Manual, pages 131-134, and the Apple II Reference Manual, 
pages 12 and 13. You'd have to be crazy to memorize all the 
various numbers to peek and poke, so it's nice to keep these 
within arm's reach.

Routines. This is a bonus for bit-flippers who want some infor- 
mation that's not in the manuals: 

For those of you who tinker in machine language and who 
are getting itchy to try out some machine-language graphics, 
here are the access points for the Applesoft graphics routines.

write your own ... or when you don't have the space for one.

HPOSITION JSR$F411 

sets the starting point for a line, as does hplot, without actually 
plotting a point. Hplot or hposition must be used to start draw- 
ing with a new hcolor, and should be used before the first hplot 
to. Y- value goes in the accumulator, X-low goes in the X regis- 
ter, and X-hi goes in the Y register. 

HPLOT TO JSR $F53A 

takes Y value in Y register, X-low in accumulator, X-hl in X 
register. 

H-res Clear JSR $F3F2 

clears the hi-res screen to black. 

Background Set JSR $F3F4 

clears the hi-res screen to the color in the accumulator. In- 
stead of 0-7, use 00, 2A, 55, 7F, 80, AA, D5, and FF. These are 
the hex values that correspond to the various bit masks used 
for the colors. You can actually use any value, but you'll get 
different color results. 

A couple of locations that are of interest are E4, which holds 
the current hcolor value, as above, and E6, which tells which 
hi-res page to draw on. The latter is useful for changing the 
page on which drawing is done without actually displaying It. 
Changes can be made on the hi-res screen that's not dis- 
played, then you can use the switch to show that page while 
drawing on the other (the hex values for those switches, given 
in decimal as -16300 and -16299 in the main article, are CX)54 
and C055) . E6 contains $20 if hi-res page 1 is being drawn on, or 
$40 if hi-res page 2 is in use. In Basic, you can use poke 230,32 
and poke 230,6k for the same results. Hi

Note that you need to include the quotes with the last three 
labels, so VisiCalc won't treat them as values. 

In order to fill in the total days column, we must add the ac- 
tivity days and trans time for the activities in each path. Here 
are the formulas: 



B15 
B16 
B17 



+ B5+C6+B6-I-C10+B10 

-I- B 5 + C 7 -I- B 7 -I- C 8 -f B 8 -I- C 1 0 + B 1 0 

+ B5 + C7+B7+C9+B9-I-C10+B10 



There should be forty-three days for each path. (Now you 
understand the need for twenty-one activity days for activity 
two; to ensure there is no single critical path yet. 

The Boolean logic columns are the place where we will set 
up the information we will need to determine the critical paths. 
It may seem as though you could simply use the path with the 
largest number in the total days column to determine the criti- 
cal path (and you could, more about this later!). But, because 
there are three possible paths, we can't do a simple single com- 
parison. In addition, there may be more than one critical path. 
Look at the model now. The total days column shows there are 
three critical paths. 

In columns C and D, we'll do comparisons. In column E we 
will compare columns C and D. All this sounds a bit compli- 
cated, but it isn't; this procedure demonstrates a method of us- 
ing Boolean functions.

We entered a logical operator that asks whether the value 
in B15 is greater than, or equal to, the value in B16. If B15 is 
greater than, or equal to, B16 the cell will return true. If B15 is 
less than B16 it will return false. Do the same for the other 
paths : 



C16: 
C17: 



-(-B16> = B15 
-(-B17> = B16 



The second Boolean logic column is similar to the first. The 
first column compared the total days for each path against an- 
other path. The second column compares the total days 
against the third path. 



D15: 
D16: 
D17: 



-l-B15> = B17 
+ B16> = B17 
+ B17> = B15 



In the two columns, we have compared each path against 
the other two. Now it is time to compile the inforniation in both 
columns to help determine which paths are critical. We will 
use the @AND function to compare the values in the other two 
columns. If both columns are true, the @AND function will 
also return true, indicating that the path is critical. If one of the 
cells is false, the function returns false because there is an- 
other path that takes more time.

This has been a good way of learning to understand Boo- 
lean functions, but it has limitations. If you build a PERT chart 
with twenty or more activities, you will go to a lot of trouble de- 
termining critical paths using this method. There is an easier 
method that can be used in a PERT chart with any number of 
activities (limited by VisiCalc's memory of course). 

The purpose of using the Boolean functions in columns C, D, 
and E is to determine if there was more than one critical path. 
We know that the critical path will be the path or paths with the 
maximum number of total days (as shown in column B) . By 
using the @MAX function we can determine what the total 
days for the critical path will be. We then use the logfical op- 
erator = to compare each path against the @MAX value and 
thus determine all critical paths. For example, the formula 
@MAX(B15 . . . B17) = B15 replaces the formulas in C15, D15, 
and E15. Each formula that returns true denotes a critical 
path. 

With a large number of activities it is better to enter the 
@MAX in a separate cell and then compare each activity 
against that cell (for example, B18=B15) . If you have to add or 
delete activities in the future, you will only have to change the 
@MAX range in one cell. 

There is also an easy method of determining which of the 
individual activities are critical. You can determine critical 
activities by finding those activities with the minimum activ- 
ity slack days. When we complete the activity slack column 
later in this article, you will be able to use the @MIN function 
on that column and then use the logical operator = to again de- 
termine critical path. 

You can then use the method below to display graphically 
the critical path and/or each individual critical activity. 

Displaying the Critical Path Graphically. It is a simple 
matter to display the critical path graphically.

F17:

/F*@IF(E16,20,0) 
/F*@IF(E 17,20,0) 



All three cells have asterisks indicating that all are critical 
paths. If you change the values in the activity days column 
(with the exception of activities one and six) the graphic indi- 
cators will change to show the critical path. Changing the ac- 
tivity days for activities one and six won't affect the critical 
path because they are on all three paths. Changing either of 
them will affect the early complete date, however. Expert-

ment with the critical path indicators. After experimenting, 
ensure that cell B6 has a value of twenty-one and the remain- 
ing cells have values of ten. 

An interesting note : the formulas in column F could com- 
bine the functions in columns C, D, and E. The formula in F17 
would be @IF(@AND((B17> = B18), (B17> = B19)),20,0). 

You can probably see how difficult it might be to find any 
problems in this formula. It is better to complete the problem 
solving in a number of different cells, as we have done, and 
later combine the functions into a single cell if you desire. 

If you look at last month's article you will see how we com- 
pleted a graphic representation of the PERT chart (similar 
to figure 1) with the critical path graphically displayed. If you 
want to complete another graphic PERT chart, you can use 
VisiCalc's graphics to draw the activity paths by replicating 
the formulas {replicate with no change) in cells F15, F16, and 
F17. The only difference will be in those cells that indicate 
more than one path (for example, the path between activity 
one and activity three). 

The formula used in the common cells for paths 1-3-5-6 and 
1-3-4-6 is: @IF(E16,20,0)-I-@IF(E17,20,0). It is nothing more 
than the addition of the formulas for the two individual paths. 
If you had a third path, as you would just prior to activity six, 
you simply add the formula in F15 also. 

If you want to try something interesting with the @IF for- 
mulas used to indicate the paths, find a free cell outside the 
PEIRT chart and enter 1. Replace the 0 at the end of every @IF 
statement used to indicate the paths, with the cell coordinate of 
the value 1. An example would be: @IF(E16,20,K10). Now, 
whenever you have a critical path displayed, the remaining 
paths will be indicated by a single asterisk in each cell. If yc 
want more or less asterisks simply change the value 1. 

Figure 1 shows a graphic representation of the complete 
PERT chart. Figure 2 shows the same PERT chart with a crit- 
ical path displayed.

Project and Activity Slack. Last month we learned that 
project slack is the difference, in days, between the estimated 
completion of a project (early complete) and the required 
completion date (late complete). Activity slack is the excess 
(or free) time that an activity has before it becomes part of the 
critical path. It is the difference between the early complete 
and late complete dates for an activity. To compute the proj- 
ect slack, enter the following:

The project slack is five days. We can check the accuracy 
by subtracting the early start from the late start. Enter at D20 
the formula -I-E5-D5. The values at D19 and D20 should be 
equal. 

There are many forward references (see last month's arti- 
cle for an explanation) in this template. To ensure that all the 
values in the template are accurate, press ! four or five times 
every time you enter a new value. If the values in D19 and D20 
are still not equal, recheck the rest of the formulas in the tem- 
plate. 

Enter activity in H2 and slack in H3. In the cells in column 
H enter the late complete cell minus the early complete cell. 
For example, at H5 enter the formula -fG5-F5. 

We have now completed the PERT table. It should look like 
figure 3. 

Resource Costs. The man/days required to complete a proj- 
ect and the resource costs are also important indices for man- 
agers. Now that we have completed the PERT, we have most 
of the information necessary to complete these analyses. The

next cell, (for example, the number 4000 should be divided so 
that 40 is in one cell and 00 is in the next cell.) 

Now comes the fun part. We want to take the activity cost 
for each activity from figure 5 and graphically display it on our 
graph. F^rst, a little theory. We have divided our graph so that 
each cell displays $2,000. The 0 to 2000 cell should take the ac- 
tivity cost for the activity and apportion it over the nine avail- 
able asterisks in the cell. If our activity cost is $1,000, it should 
show 4.5 asterisks. VisiCalc won't display one-half asterisks; it 
truncates decimals and in this case will display four asterisks. 
That is sufficient for our purposes, but if you desire greater ac- 
curacy, you could change the column width and dollar range 
for each cell and have a very accurate method of displaying in- 
formation. If you made the cell width 11 {VisiCalc displays one 
less asterisk than the cell width) and the range $1,000, each as- 
terisk would be worth $100. 

The first cell (0-2000) should be formatted for graphics 
(/F*) and contain the following formula: 

(Activity Cost CELL COORDINATE/2000)*9 

Enter that formula in the 0-2000 cell for each activity. We 
have taken the activity cost and divided it by 2000 to determine 
the number of cells required and then multiplied that value by 



nine to determine the total number of asterisks required. 

Next, consider the remaining cells. The formulas will be 
similar. Suppose the cost is $9,600. We can look at the chart and 
determine that the asterisks will continue from 0 almost to 
10000. The second cell should take the value in the first cell 
(which is the total asterisks that should be displayed) , and sub- 
tract the number of asterisks displayed (or used) in the first 
cell. The formulas should read: (PRIOR CELL 
COORDINATE) - 9. Replicate that formula throughout the re- 
mainder of the chart (using Relative references) and you have 
completed the cost comparison bar chart. It should look simi- 
lar to the chart in figure 7.

Days versus Dates. There is another capability that you 
might consider adding to your PERT that would make it even 
more useful. We have completed a PERT chart that will com- 
pute gross days based upon a starting day. Wouldn't it be nice 
to be able to enter both early start and late complete date and 
have the dates for the start and completion of each activity 
computed? This isn't exactly a trivial process, especially since 
you probably won't want to count weekends as work days. If 
you are interested in learning something about calendars 
(there are a number of methods), please write and let us 
know; we will try to discuss them in a future column. That

Robots are here and they are changing the world we live In. From bulky Industrial 
welders to fantastically complex planetary probes, robots are sure to make our lives a little 
easier. Robots will get much more sophisticated In the decades to come; by the next cen- 
tury they may be our model citizens. 

But will robots be Immune from the human weaknesses that usually attend a high level 
of intelligence? On the cover of our August 1981 issue we fantasized what a humanold robot 
may look like in the future. We also gave this highly developed mechanical man the hard- 
est task we could devise — contemplating an object and its significance. 

Will robots ever be able to sit and think about something that is not directly related to 
performing a task? 

Softalk can't answer that question for you, but we can help you contemplate the un- 
known future in a special way. We commissioned graphics artist Robert Zraick to do 
August's cover with a poster in mind. The robot contemplating a bite is evocative both of 
Rodin's The Thinker and the Genesis passage on the Garden of Eden . . . not to mention the 
possible significance to our favorite technological fruit. 

The artist and Softalk are sharing in the profits from the poster. Softalk will distribute 
its proceeds to individuals developing Apple tools to help the handicapped. Softalk guaran- 
tees 100 percent distribution of its monies. 

In addition to the posters, which are sold at $6.00 (plus $1.50 to cover shipping and han- 
dling) , some of the two hundred artist's proofs, signed by Robert Zraick, are still available 
at $75 each. 

The size of the poster is 24 inches by 34 Inches. The artist's proofs are hand-numbered and 
hand-signed, and each is accompanied by a certificate giving Its number and guarantee- 
ing that only 200 are being distributed. 

Robert Zraick's art will grace any computer room, and your purchase will help others 
become more self-sufficient.

Sitting down to his new adventure game, the player finds 
himself on his way back to Earth with an antiplague serum 
among his other cargo. But his ship is overtaken by an alien 
race, forced dovm onto their planet, stripped down to the hull, 
the pieces are scattered over the alien planet, and he's impris- 
oned. Can he find the keys to reversing that process? 

If that sounds more like the plot of a science fiction novel 
than an adventure game, that's probably because it's a de- 
scription of Oo-Topos, an adventure game written by Michael 
Berlyn, a programmer who was a science fiction novelist be- 
fore discovering micros. 

Berlyn's story reverses many of the trends shown by other 
writers who use small computers for word processors. Always 
an independent spirit, the thirty-two-year-old novelist, whose 
credits include Crystal Phoenix and The Integrated Man with 
Bantam Books, and Blight under the name "Mark Bonders" 
with Ace Books, actually became a writer because, as he puts 
it, "I hate working. I don't work well for other people. I need to 
be doing something creative. I paint, and I'm a musician — I 
played electric violin and guitar for a rock group called Taylor 
Mills Road in New York for a while." 

But more was involved than creative laziness. Always an 
avid science fiction reader, Berlyn took a course in science fic- 
tion as literature while an undergraduate at Florida Atlantic 
University. "My professor said that for our final exam we 



could write a short story," Berlyn recalls. "So I figured, 'Okay, 
what's so hard about that?' Little did I know." 

But when the professor told Berlyn that his story was worth 
publishing, it gave the young rebel something to ponder. "I 
thought, if it's possible for me, I'd much rather make my liv- 
ing doing something by myself for myself in which I'm my own 
boss than work for someone else." 

An Apple II proved the catalyst that transformed Berlyn 
the writer into Berlyn the programmer. "I was going full blast 
as a science fiction writer when I decided to purchase an Apple 
to use as a word processor. I figured that it would save me a lot 
of time and work in not having to retype anjrthing. 

"My first word processor was Dr. Memory, which was 
really all that was around then," he recalls. "I struggled along 
with it as best I could — or as best as it could — and while I was 
doing that, I was playing games for my own amusement. 1 
found myself enjoying the games more and more and trying to 
figure out whether or not I could write them myself." 

Soon Berlyn found himself splitting his time "about fifty- 
fifty" between writing on his Apple and writing for it. 

"That's how I got started in it in the summer of 1978. 1 was 
getting more and more involved in the Apple. Writing a pro- 
gram is very similar to writing a book in that there are prob- 
lems that must be overcome, and you can see when it's work- 
ing and when it's not working, and there are levels and layers 
of complexity," Berlyn says.

"The amount of satisfaction that I can achieve from writ- 
ing a good program is— I will not say the equal of writing a 
good book, but it is similar. The more I got involved with pro- 
gramming, the more I wanted to learn about assembly and 
Forth and the different languages that were out there." 

A "laser learner," Berlyn set his sights on what he wanted 
to know, and went straight for it. He started absorbing com- 
puterese at an incredible rate and, within six months, was an 
adequate programmer. "Having an Apple at home full time 
and having nothing else to do was a help," he admits. 

But as he eased into programming, Berlyn stayed close to 
familiar ground— he wrote a science fiction adventure game. 
"Oo-Topos was my first program, and I think I bit off more 
than I could chew at the time," he says. "I liked the original 
Adventure so much that I wanted to do something like it, a lot 
larger, a lot more intelligent, a lot larger vocabulary, but 
basically in the same format. 

"I started on it just about the time I got Dr. Memory, and 
worked on it for a year and a half, until I got it into the shape 
that it is now. It turned out to be 150 rooms and about four hun- 
dred-some-odd vocabulary words — it really grew into some- 
thing huge." 

Oo-Topos is still doing very well, Berlyn says. "People 
seem to like it. It was the first real science fiction adventure 
with any kind of a plot, any kind of tone, with any kind of 
science fiction consistency in it." 

In 1980 Berlyn and his new wife, Muffy, left West Palm 
Beach, Florida, and relocated to Aspen, Colorado. "I sold my 
Apple," he says. "I had no real plans to stay with computers, 
but when we got here, I just happened to walk into a computer 
store in town and ask if they needed any programs written." 




The store's owners almost leapt upon him, he says. "They 
really needed a programmer in the area. It's a pretty isolated 
little town, although very sophisticated, and there wasn't a pro- 
grammer here, especially for Apples. It was a tailor-made sit- 
uation." 

He began working at the store and within a short time de- 
cided to found a software company with some other people in 
the area. "When we started, we set our sights on outdoing Visi- 
Corp, which was then Personal Software. We're dedicated to 
high-quality programs and national distribution— that whole 
trip. We've been working really hard at doing that." 

For Berlyn, the key to high-quality prog^ramming is inter- 
activity. "Actually, the name of our company is Sentient, and 
sentient means 'aware,' " he says. "In a science fiction sense, 
when you call an alien creature sentient, you mean that it's an 
intelligent, feeling, aware creature, almost as if it had human 
qualities. And that is what our goal is for all of our programs. 
To make the user feel as if he's interacting with a partner 
rather than a machine." 

Berlyn is in charge of games development at Sentient and 
still writes games himself. Other games projects are pres- 
ently jobbed out to freelance programmers, and Sentient 
boasts a business line coming out with a general ledger, ac- 
counts receivable, and accounts payable. "We've also spent a 
long time developing a job-cost and accounting package for 
hard disk," Berljm says. 

Today he programs almost entirely in assembly, he says. 
"Oo-Topos is an all-Applesoft program. "Cyborg, my second 
adventure game, is about 75 percent Applesoft and 25 percent 
assembly, and two graphics games I just finished, Congo and 
Gold Rush, are all assembly. The differences between the Ian-

guages is really incredible in getting results, and I find assem- 
bly easier to work in now than Basic. Besides, I enjoy it a lot 
more. I'm starting to look at Forth as a real viable language, 
especially for the kind of interactive adventures I want to 
write." 

Interactive? Yes, Berlyn says, with both his artist's and his 
businessman's natures showing. "Pure adventure games as 



extended puzzles have probably had their day — they just can't 
compete with graphics games," he says. "But the adventure 
games are evolving into interactive novels, the first all-com- 
puter aesthetic development. 

"Oo-Topos is the start of an interactive novel, but Cyborg is 
an interactive novel. Cyborg isn't even an adventure, although 
we bill it as one, and it's being reviewed and played as an ad- 
venture. The program itself is about the same size as Oo-Topos 
is, but there's an excuse, a reason for the computer being 
there. 

"It really creates another persona, a character in the com- 
puter, and that is your cyborgan half. As a player, you are only 
half the player. You have a partner that is the computer, and 
you can ask opinions of it on locations, on objects, on situ- 
ations ; you can have it scan objects for you using its cyborg 
powers." 

What makes a program an interactive novel? The same 
thing that makes a book interactive, Berlyn says: total ab- 
sorption into the characters, the situation, and the plot. 

"What takes people away from being absorbed in games is 
the lack of sophistication of the user interface," he says. "So a 
program becomes an interactive novel when playing. It's no 
longer simply a question of walking through situations and solv- 
ing puzzles. Instead, there's something that unfolds, that il- 
luminates the player. 

"So instead of identifying with a hero you read about, you 
become the hero as you play. And the role that the hero plays is 
different in an interactive novel than in an adventure game. 
Both the player and the plot evolve as the game is played." 

In that respect, Berlyn has managed to achieve a luilque 
synthesis of the programmer and writer into a new breed of 
artist. "I'm involved in two projects that are cutting new 
ground," he says. "I really can't discuss one of them, but the 
other is going to bring the adventure another step closer to the 
interactive novel." 

So Michael Berlyn is back over the keyboard of one of the 
two Apple lis or the Apple III at Sentient, but whether he's a 



LOCK-IT-UP 4.1 



Copy-Protection System 
for the Apple II 
by Jeff Gold 



If you are serious about selling software for the Apple II, piracy is the leading problem which you 
will face. According to an article which appeared in SOFTLINE magazine, January 1982, page 21, 
software piracy increases the distribution of programs by as much as five or six times. This 
process is facilitated by many of the "nibble" copy programs now available which claim to copy 
almost all software. 

Double-Gold is now introducing a solution to this problem, Lock-It-Up 4.1. This program will 
take a standard DOS 3.3 diskette, copy-protect it, and then allow rapid duplication of the product. 
Not only does our software protect against all standard copy programs, it also protects against all 
"nibble" copy programs currently available, including: Locksmith 4.1, Back-lt-Up, Clone, Omni 
Copy, Nibbles Away, and Copy II+, among others. Our system incorporates over thirty state-of- 
the-art copy-protection features making it highly unlikely for "nibble" copiers to be able to copy 
these diskettes in the near future. Our product also includes an optional "semi-hardware" 
modification, making it unlikely for anyone to successfully copy the protected program even 
in the future. 

Our low one-time fee of only $195 is a small price to pay in order to increase your sales by up to 
six-fold! We will also give extensive support should you have any special needs, or should any 

problems arise. _ _

The Leader in Apple Graphics 

THE COMPLETE 
GRAPHICS SYSTEM 

II 




by Chris Jochumson and 
Mark Pelczarski 



Now anyone can put profes- 
sional graphics into their own 
programs. The Graphics Magi- 
cian contains machine language 
animation routines that use the 
same techniques as most of the 
popular Apple arcade games. 
Three animation editors let you 
design your figures, their paths, 
and assemble animation with up 
to 32 independent objects. 
Also included is a hi-res 
picture/object builder that lets you store hundreds of 100-color pictures 
on a single disk and recall them quickly from your own programs. These 
exact routines are being used in the new graphic adventure games from 
Scott Adams' Adventure International. Plus, a new shape editor greatly ex- 
tends the capabilities of Apple shape tables with multicolors and angles 
that are preserved on scaling. All design of graphics is done through menu- 
driven editors; to use in your programs, just attach our machine language 
routines. Extensive documentation makes this package easy to use for the 
beginning programmer, yet flexible enough for the most advanced.

programmer doing writing or a writer doing programming is 
hard to tell. Yet despite his achievements, he doesn't consider 
himself particularly unique. 

"The science fiction market was easier to break into than 
any other," he says, "in that it is one of the only short story 
markets that is still actively searching out material, and they 
had absolutely no objections to buying a story from an unpub- 
lished writer. Well, that kind of free and easy attitude exists In 
programming, too. It's getting less and less like that, but It 
sure was like that last year, and it was even more like that the 
year before. 

"The level of sophistication in the programs that are com- 
ing out precludes the home hobbyist from knocking something 
out over his weekends, and then expecting it to make it in the 
big time. But opportunity is still wide open. Good program- 
mers can still find a place even if they're self-taught." 

At Sentient, he says, they're actively seeking out people 
who write programs. "There are people out there in college or 
in high school who don't do anything when they go home but 
write programs. Every software company is looking for those 
people, and there's a lot of money there to be made by free- 
lancers, too. It's still wide open in that respect," Berlyn says. 

Software companies need new programmers because of the 
high level of competition, he says. "I just know If you're doing 
a space graphics game, you really have to compete with 
people like On- Line and Slrius, because their work Is out there 
and available. Someone would have to be crazy to buy your 
game if it weren't £is good as theirs. The level of sophistication 
Is going up as far as the quality of progprams that are available 
now." 

Nor does he find the dominance of arcade games un- 
healthy — with some exceptions. "They're fine as long as what 
they're offering Is not destructive. Pac-Man Is what I consider 
a nonviolent arcade game. Something like Defender, where 
you're shooting down things and the object of the game Is to de- 



stroy as many things as possible creates a whole different feel- 
ing while you're playing it. Implied violence is a negative as- 
pect of arcade games that really isn't being dealt with. I'd like 
to see it addressed somehow. 

"My least favorite game is Missile Command. It's really a 
sick game. And my second least favorite is Shark Attack. In 
that one, the player is the shark, and the goal is to rip up and

"Games like Pac-Man I don't see anything wrong with at 
all, or the amount of quarters being pumped into them. It's a 
phase, but we lived through the hula hoop. It's going to level 
out, I'm sure — especially since I'm in the business now." 

And for Michael Berlyn's future? "I still love science 
fiction. I still like working for myself. So underneath It all, I'm 
still a writer," he says. 

"I'm using SuperText II now. It's my own personal prefer- 
ence after my experience with all the capitalizing functions In 
Dr. Memory. I find WordStar a bit of overkill for what I need, 
so I never bothered with it. And I've lised Paymar's upper/ 
lower case adapter since It came out — of course, his was the 
only one then, so I don't have anything to compare It to. 

"But I can hardly wait for the day I can buy a word proces- 
sor all my own and sit at home doing nothing but writing. I'm 
being a programmer now, and I'm doing it with a passion, but 
I'm still a writer. I'm 100 percent committed to programming, 
and, when that phase of my life Is over, I'll commit myself to 
whatever's next. 

"I was a musician for seven years, and I was totally com- 
mitted to that. And when that phase of my life was over, I was 
completely committed to writing. And now it's programming. 

"So I don't know what lies ahead, but I sure hope I'll go 
back to writing. I look forward to it, but I don't begrudge the 
time I'm spending programming now at all. It's very ex- 
citing."

Not in color. With cQli)r.y!n^ h e pro^ agt3nn9-ffi-k black 
and white screera Confused? You won't bg^hen you^'ve used-' 
the Apple III color table. It operates on colors, and thdse oper- 
ations become logic elements to implement Conway's Game of 
Life. 

Colors' Numbers Are Values, Too. Apple comes with an 
elaborate graphics package that is easily accessible from high 
level languages such as Business Basic and Pascal, In Bfisic 
programs one employs the BGRAF.INV Invokable module, in 
Pascal the PGRAIf library unit. Each contains the same set of 
about two dozen graphics utility procedures. These fast ma- 
chine language routines are called up by simple program com- 
mands. They plot lines, dots, and shapes, change colors and 
viewports, and perform many other complex jobs aroimd the 
graphics screen. One of these utility procedures sets the Apple 
III color table, a subtle device whose power seeps only 
gradually into consciousness. 

At any given moment, every dot on a graphics screen has 
some sort of color. In black and white mode each dot is either 
black (off) or white (on) . In color mode each dot is one of the 
sixteen colors available on Apple III, which range from black 
to white, with pinks, greens, and other hues between. Of course 
if you're using a black and white monitor you won't see all 
those lovely colors, just sixteen different shades of gray. But 
the computer doesn't really know or, let's be honest, even care 
what kind of TV you've got. 

Table 1 lists the colors available for Apple III graphics. In 
Business Basic, colors are referred to by number. In Pascal,

Table 1. Color Numbers for Apple III Graphics 



on the other hand, the PGRAF library unit declares a 
screencolor type containing the color names as an ordered set. 
So in Pascal you simply use the color names themselves as 
parameters for graphics procedures. Since these color names 
do form an ordered set, each has an ordinality within the set. 



J 



and the ordinality of a screencolor is the same integer as the 
color nunpiber used in Basic. Thus, in Pascal, x: = ord (orange) 
will assigkxthe value 9, which is the ordinality of orange in the 
screencolor set. 

In actual operation, the color table is a simple affair. Sup- 
pose you send a new color to a particular spot on the graphics 
screen. This new color could be the currently specified pen- 
color when plotting a dot or a line, or it could be the current fUl- 
color as background for a shape or as the weush color when 
clearing a section of the screen. In either case you send a 
source color to a screen dot which is, of course, already oc- 
cupied by some "old" color. 

Normally one would expect the source color simply to re- 
place the old color. But the color table lets you change that. 
The necessary command has the form setctabfSOUBCE, 
OLD, RESULT), which alters one element of the color table. 
For example, in Pascal setctab(pink,green,brown) directs 
that, henceforth, any attempt to change a green dot into a pink 
dot will produce a brown dot. No other color combinations are 
affected. In Business Basic the same command would appear 
PERFORM setctab(%ll, %12, %8) . Note the percent signs. They 
are essential. They direct Basic to pass the parameter values 
as integers, each of which has two bytes of binary code, rather 
thai! as real numbers, each of which has four bytes. 

Changing Values. Each such command sets only one of the 
256 elements in the color table. Collectively these elements 
specify the result color for each of the 256 possible combina- 
tions of the sixteen source colors and sixteen old colors. On 
power-up, the color table is set to its default condition, which 
is the simple replacement one normally expects. In other 
words the result color is set in each case to be the source color. 
Thus, in default condition, the color table simply appears not to 
exist. But interesting things begin to happen when you reset 
one or more of the 256 result colors to a different value. 

The color table can be used for a variety of purposes. The 
Apple manual cites the example of line plotting where the color 
table is used to protect existing lines from new lines subse- 
quently plotted across them. If you plot a brown line across pre- 
existing orange lines, the new brown line, in default condition, 
will replace orange dots wherever the lines cross. Thus the 
new line will appear to overlie the old. But if you protect 
orange dots with the command setctab(brown,orange,- 
orange), the intersections will remain orange and the new

brown line will appear to ran ulidemeath. A more exotic effect 
is achieved with setctab(broion,orange,purple). Now the 
brown line will appear to run under the orange and show 
through as purple. 

Notice in this example that the user need not figure out just 
where the lines will cross. The new line changes from brown to 
purple automatically when orange dots are encountered. This 
is one of the remarkably powerful features of the color table. 
The user can designate particular dots (or at least dots of a 
particular color) and selectively protect them or change them 
to another color without knowing or being able to predict ex- 
actly where those dots will be. 

Sixteen Motley Registers. This capability may be illustrat- 
ed by another example slightly modified from one in the Apple 
manual. Suppose one has a complex graphics "photograph" in 
several colors. Suppose further that one decides to change all 
the light blue dots, scattered who knows where all over the 
screen, from light blue to dark blue, and all the green dots, 
similarly scattered, from green to dark green. The following 
Pascal routine will serve: 

for col := black to white do 
case col of 

llghtblue: setctab(brown,lightblue,darkblue); 

green: setctab(brown,green,darkgreen) 
otherwise setctab(brown,col,col) ["old" = "result"] 
end; [cose] 
fillcolor(brown); 

fillport; [washes screen with brown . . . 

only lightblue and green dots are changed] 

This is more graceful, and far qxiicker, than the brute-force 
method of examining every dot on the screen. 

The accompanying program uses the color table as a logic 
device by assigning numbers to colors. Then, through suitable 
settings of the color table, each screen dot is made to serve as a 
counting register. This makes possible an unusual version of 
Conway's Game of Life in which all calculations occxir direct- 
ly on the graphics screen as manipulations of color. 

Give Me the Simple Life. More than a decade ago, John 
Conway's solitaire game Life was explained in a series of 
Martin Gardner's "Mathematical Games" articles in Scientif- 
ic American (October 1970, November 1970, February 1971). 



Life is played with counters on an unboimded checkerboard of 
cells. One begins with any desired pattern of counters called 
the "first generation." The pattern subsequently evolves from 
generation to generation, often producing long convoluted 
histories of amazing complexity. The generations succeed 
each other in accordance with very simple rules. An empty cell 
adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to exactly three count- 
ers is a birth cell and will contain a counter in the next genera- 
tion. An existing counter will survive to the next generation 
only if it has either two or three neighbors. K a counter has one 
neighbor, or none, it dies of isolation, while with four or more 
neighbors it dies of overpopulation. 

At first glance this game seems readily amenable to the 
simplest sort of computer program. The obvious approach, 
which we'll call algorithm 1, is to scan the screen and look at 
each cell. For each cell, merely count its occupied neighbors 
and plot the corresponding next generation cell accordingly. 
This is quite straightforward and can be roughed out very 
quickly. Early efforts worked very nicely and produced a new 
generation every few minutes. Unfortimately, the execution 
speed had a less than dazzling effect on the spectators. 

The problems were becoming clear. The scan routine had 
to look at every screen location. By itself this isn't too bad. A 
"board" size of 40 x 40 locations contains only 1,600 cells, and 
Apple ni can whack out 1,600 spot checks very quickly. But 
each such location requires processing. For each location the 
program must examine at least four and usually all eight of the 
surrounding cells. Thus each location on the screen must, in ef- 
fect, be checked up to nine times, equivalent to nine separate 
full screen scans. 

Furthermore, the initial scan may calculate, but may not 
plot, each cell's status in the next generation. Counters must 
not be changed during the first scan because, as the scan pro- 
ceeds, the program will look back from any given row to count 
neighbors in the preceding row. Those neighbors must still be 
of the current generation, not the next. So, during the scan, the 
next generation information mvist be stored elsewhere. This 
could, for instance, be in an array in memory. But in that case 
the array must later be transposed onto the graphics screen, a 
time-consuming process. A better alternative stores the next 
generation directly onto the graphics screen, but on page 2. 
The two graphics screens are then displayed alternately. This 
scheme works well as long as one has a fast procedure for 



172

clearing each page between generations. 

The most serious drawback to the approach just outlined is 
that every available cell on the screen must be processed 
whether occupied or not. Because of the rules of the game, 
many more cells are empty than occupied, even for very large 
patterns. So it would be nice if somehow one could "process" 
only occupied cells. That strategy is adopted in algorithm 2. 

Friendly Neighbors. In the first algorithm we looked at 
each square, occupied or not, and determined how many oc- 
cupied neighbors it possessed. But it is equally correct to focus 
on occupied cells and say that an occupied cell exerts a "neigh- 
borly influence" on each of the eight surrounding cells. To ex- 
ploit the concept of influence, one needs two capabilities. First, 
one needs a very quick and recognizable method of stamping 
this influence on the surrounding cells. Second, one needs some 
convenient method of counting the number of such influences a 
cell has received. Apple III graphics' Drawlmage procedure 
provides the stamping device and the color table does the 
counting. 

In algorithm 2 the initial scan stops at each occupied cell 
and stamps a ring of influence on its neighbors. Since all such 
influences will have been distributed by the end of the initial 
scan, one may, on the second scan, directly plot the next gen- 
eration. One merely scans the cells, marks "occupied" those 
with the right numbers of influences, and marks "empty" all 
the others. Note that during the initial scan this algorithm does 
not explicitly calculate the next-generation status of any partic- 
ular cell. But it has the great advantage of processing only oc- 
cupied cells instead of every cell on the screen. Fiirthermore, 
thanks to the color table, the second scan can be entrusted to a 
very quick machine langxiage graphics procedure. Thus only 
one high-level language scan is reqmred, and that scan skips 
quickly over the empty cells. 

Have no fear. You still don't have to cope with excessive 
speed. The program still scans through extensive blank areas 
of the screen during which the computer appears to have 
slipped off into never-never land. In a practical program, you 
need to create a search window that limits the scan to the area 
of interest. 

According to Conway's rules, a counter's influence extends 
only to contiguous cells. This means that any particular pat- 
tern can spread and grow only at the maximum rate of one row 
or column per generation in each direction. So, if one starts 
with a small pattern of a few centrally placed counters, there is 
no point in searching the entire screen. A tremendous increase 
in speed, for either algorithm, is achieved by confining the 
search to an appropriate window that grows and shrinks with 
the pattern. 

Like everything else, this has a price. Manipulating the win- 
dow involves additional subroutines which themselves add 
execution time. This is well worth it for a small central pat- 
tern, but as the pattern grows and approaches full screen, the 
additional program lines no longer serve a useful purpose and 
act only as a brake. On the other hand, by the time the pattern 
fills the screen you'll probably be getting bored anyway. 

Through a Outtered Window. The worst effect of window- 
ing routines is that they clutter up and obscure the program, 
which is principally designed to illustrate use of the color table. 
About one-third of the accompanying program is occupied by 
window routines, placed there solely in the interest of speed. 
The reader should pay them as little attention as possible. 

The program is presented both in Pascal and Business 
Basic. The two versions are virtually identical since the pro- 
gram was first written in Pascal and then translated into 
Basic. Close comparison, however, will reveal a number of dif- 
ferences that exploit some of the powerful abilities of Apple III 
Business Basic that are not duplicated in Pascal. On the other 
hand, the Pascal version is, as usual, much easier to read, and 
executes faster — in this case almost twice as fast. But the 
Basic version is still quite acceptable. Most important, the two 
versions of the program illustrate the use of machine-lan- 
guage subroutines common to the two languages. The graphics 
procedures are the same in each, although the two languages 



require slightly different command formats. 

The program uses Apple III graphics' Drawlmage pro- 
cedure to mark the influence of a counter on its neighboring 
cells. Drawlmage very quickly draws a stored image at any 
designated spot on the graphic screen. The image must al- 
ready have been created and stored in memory in the form of a 
bit map. In Basic, one uses an integer array, although in Pas- 
cal a packed array of boolean is more convenient. The Draw- 
Image procedure really deserves an article of its own and is 
merely exploited here, not analyzed. 

The stored patterns used by Drawlmage are plotted in two 
colors. The shape is drawn in the currently specified pencoZor 
upon a rectangular background of the current /iHco tor. One may 
plot either the entire image or any rectangfular subsection. For 
this program the image is a three-by-three square of nine com- 
plete cells, as shown in figure 1. The outer ring of cells each 
contains a counter and the center cell is blank. If the center of 
the image is superimposed on a preexisting counter, then that 
central cell and the eight surrounding cells are all replotted si- 
multaneously. The tricky part comes with the colors used and 
their interactions due to the color table.

Figure 1. 

Looping through Generations. The prog^ram is a loop that 
accepts a pattern of counters, the current generation, and con- 
verts it to the next generation. At the start of each loop the cur- 
rent generation exists as a pattern of counters drawn in white 
on an empty black background. The counters appear as little 
squares, although each is actually one dot wide and two dots 
high. Counters in adjacent cells are separated by a gap of the 
same dimensions as the counter. Thus each cell is an area two 
dots wide and four dots high, and the counter itself occupies 
one-fourth of the cell. At the beginning of a generation-loop, the 
counter area of each cell is either white (occupied) or black 
(empty). During "calculation" the counter may appear in 
other colors, but the rest of the cell always remains blank. 

The program scans until it finds an occupied cell, which it 
recognizes by a counter of white (color number 15) dots (or, as 
we shall see, by dots of any color of number 10 or greater). 
Drawlmage is then centered on the found cell and replots that 
cell and its neighbors in a three-by-three cell area. The pen- 
color used for Drawlmage is orange (9) with a black (0) back- 
ground. Drawlmage thus plots a ring of eight orange counters 
in surrounding cells and a black (empty) counter in the center. 
Normally, one would expect the old counter in the middle (at 
the scan coordinates) to be turned black and effectively 
erased. But not so, for we will have rendered black impotent as 
a source color with: 

for col := black to white do setctab(black,col,col); 

This means that when black is a source color, every old color 
will also be the result color. So black isn't going to change any- 
thing. Thus the central counter, the current focus of the scan, 
will remain unchanged. 

What about counters in the surrounding cells? Let's sup- 
pose one of them is initially black (0) . Normally we would ex- 
pect this counter to turn orange (9) , which is the pencolor used 
by Drawlmage. But even though the source color is orange, we 
will have changed the result color: 

PERFORM setctab (%9,%0,%1);REM 9=orange, 0=black, l=magenta 

Application of one influence will now change a black counter 
(0) to magenta (1) . We are beginning to count. Similarly, if the 
color was already magenta (1) we will let the source color 
(orange) change it to number 2, and so on: 

FOR col = 0 to 3: PERFORM setctab (%9,%col,%col+ 1): NEXT col 

So if a counter starts out black (0) , each successive applica- 
tion of influence increments the color number and the screen 
dots have become counting registers. According to the rules. 



all cells with four or more neighbors die of overpopulation, so it 
is pointless to count past four. We stop counting with the com- 
mand. PERFORM setctab(^c9,%4,%tt) . After reaching dark 
green (4) , the color will change no further no matter how many 
influences are applied. 

Suppose Draxvlmage stamps influence on a cell that al- 
ready contains a counter. In this case we decrement the color 
number from 15 to 14 to 13, and so on. 

FOR col = 12 to 15: PERFORM setctab(%9,%col,%col- 1): NEXT col 

Again we can stop counting after four with PERFORM 
setctab(%9, %11, %11). 

At the end of the scan all influences will have been dis- 
tributed. Cells that previously were empty (color 0) will have 
counters in the color range 0 to 4, depending on the number of 
occupied neighbors. Similarly, cells that previously were oc- 
cupied will have colors 11 to 15. We are now ready to plot the 
next generation. 

For the second scan we simply change the flUcolor to white 
and wash the entire screen. If the color table were in default 
condition this would, of course, turn everj^hing white and 
erase all trace of the pattern. But we change the color table so 
that the old colors purple (3), green (12), and yellow (13) are 
indeed changed to white, but all other old colors are changed to 
black. Thus all counters with the proper number of influences 
become white, and all others are erased. In Pascal: 

for col := black to white do 
if col in [purple,green,yellow) 
then 

setctab(white,col, white) 
else 

setctab(white,col,black); 

PERFORM fillport washes the screen and there's the next 
generation. 

Setting Up a Ovlllzation or Two. The program must also 
provide means for placing the initial pattern, the first genera- 
tion. A visible cursor is presented that may be moved about 
from cell to cell. Individual counters may be placed in any cell. 
This is also done with Drawl mage, which places single 
counters by plotting only a comer, one cell, of the nine-cell 
image. There is also a procedure for presenting a few instruc- 
tions at the beginning. These instructions are really rather 
sparse, but knowing how you love to type. . . . 

The rest of the program is cluttered up with windowing pro- 
cedures. These should be included and ignored. The program 
is terminated by any keystroke. In Business Basic the KBD In- 
terrupt acts instantly, but in Pascal the progp-am will run on to 
the end of that generation before keypress is checked. 

As a trial run you might try the R Pentomino in figfure 2. 
This pattern has a long complicated history that runs on and on 
for hundreds of generations, possibly forever.

Figure 2. 

The program runs very nicely on a black and white mon- 
itor. If the brightness knob is turned down to some civilized lev- 
el, color numbers from 0 to about 10 are too dim to show up, so 
the "influence" squares are invisible, or nearly so. Thus one 
actually sees only the "legal" counters that are supposed to be 
there. On the other hand, with a full-color screen, all those 
magentas and purples of colors 1 to 4 appear. This is a very in- 
teresting effect. The resulting confusion makes it jtist about 
impossible to see the pattern of legal counters, so as Life, it 
isn't great. But the colorful influence squares do have a cer- 
tain hypnotic charm all their own.

professionally produced and very well written ... a 
pleasure to read . . . this product has no competition on the 

market ..." Peelings II, March 1 982 

Rated number two of the top five utilities in Info- World, 
Inarch 8, 1982. John C. Dvorak 



The following packages have routines 
from Hi-Res Secrets as a basis for their

"Hi-Res Secrets makes it possible for a programmer to 
write a sophisticated game that will compete with anything 
on the market. How can they sell this for only $ 125? ..." 

Stanley Crane, author of DB MASTER**, February 1982 

It's the most complete compilation of Apple graphics infor- 
mation on the market . . . well worth the price . . . the color 
filling routines are the fastest I've seen . . . in a class by 
itself . . . bound to increase the ranks of good Apple

□ MlcroStand (Tolovana Park, OR) , pro- 
ducers of various hardware accessories 
for microcomputers, welcomes John 
Nicholson to its staff. He brings five 
years of experience in finance and mar- 
keting to his position as marketing direc- 
tor for the company. 

□ Software Distributors (Culver City, 
CA) has expanded its customer service 
force for its wholesale line of business 
and entertainment software packages. A 
special team will be in charge of main- 
taining the currentness of the company's 
inventory, monitoring manufacturing de- 
velopments, and keeping dealers in- 
formed of software requiring updating. 
The company forecasts a 25 percent per 
month sales growth for the remainder of 
the year. 

□ In response to dealer suggestions. Life- 
boat Associates (New York, NY) has an- 
nounced a new dealer policy that makes 
a greater number of discountable items 
available from its library of software 
programs with no minimum order re- 
quirement. Director of business develop- 
nfient and*Fharketing EMdie Currie notes 
the advantage in bookkeeping reduction 
that the program provides, plus "more 
effective inventory control because it re- 
quires less capital to be tied up in special- 
ized programs that have limited market 
appeal." 

□ Micro Focus (Santa Clara, CA), pro- 
ducer of software tools for business pro- 
gramming, won six awards at the 
eleventh annual ICP Million Dollar A- 
wards ceremony last April in Scottsdale, 
Arizona. The company won the Interna- 
tional Computer Programs "$5 Million 
Dollar Floppy Award" for CIS Cobol, two 
$1 million dollar awards for Level II Co- 
bol, and three "Super Sales" awards. 

Among those acknowledged were 
president Paul O' Grady, Paul Adams, 
who opened up the Japanese market for 
the company's Cobol products, and tech- 
nical director Stewart Lang. 

□ Applied Software Technology (Monte 
Sereno, CA) , manufacturer of the Versa- 
Form business form processor, has en- 
tered into distribution agreements for the 
state of California with Computer Poten- 
tials of Sunnyvale, Software Express of 
Mountain View, Software Distributors of 
Culver City, and Softsel of Ingle wood. 
Computer Potentials has been further 
designated as exclusive regional distrib- 
utor for Northern California. 

"Due to the diversity of domestic dis- 
tribution channels, for microcomputer 
products, there is not one model that's 
right in all or most cases," said Applied 
Software general manager Joseph Lan- 



dau. "While it is difficult to mix distribu- 
tors, reps, national account sales by 
OEMs, and privately licensed OEMs, I 
am convinced that no one channel can be 
disregarded." 

□ A $1.75 million venture capital funding 
agreement has been entered into by Al- 
phacom (Campbell, CA) and Churchill 
International (Menlo Park, CA), the 
funds to be invested in Alphacom's fu- 
ture growth by increasing its work 
capital. 

According to Churchill's managing di- 
rector Spencer W. Hoopes, "Alphacom's 
thermal and impact matrix printer prod- 
uct line provides an ideal complement to 
the Churchill computer-family of invest- 
ments, which include Sanders Technol- 
ogy, Micromation, and ECS Microsys- 
tems." 

n Computer Station (St. Louis, MO) has 
introduced a host of new services for its 
dealers, installing a toll-free order num- 
ber (800-325-4019) and a technical assist- 
ance line (314-432-7120) for users with 
technically involved problems. The com- 
pany has also increased its advertising. 

Computer Station's general audience 
products are available through Softsel, 
High Technology, and Computerland. 
Data sheets are enclosed on request with 
each order. 

□ Corvus Systems (San Jose, CA) has 
completed a 25,000-square-foot expan- 
sion of its manufacturing facilities. Ac- 
cording to Pat Elmendorf, vice presi- 
dent of operations, the additional capac- 
ity will be used to meet increasing de- 
mand for present Corvus products while 
allowing dedication of facilities to high- 
volume production of a major new prod- 
uct line. 

The company reported profits of 
$907,000 on sales of $11.37 million worth of 
its local networks and Winchester disk 
mass storage systems for the six months 
ending November 30, 1982. 

□ Microcon SoftwareCenters (Water- 
town, MA) has opened its second store in 
the Northeast, located in Wobum, Mas- 
sachusetts, in the Wobum Mall. 

"If this store follows the pattern of our 
Watertown store," said president Barry 
Passen, "we'll be pulling customers from 
as far north as Maine and New Hamp- 
shire." 

The Woburn store is geared to family 
and business markets; additional busi- 
ness support will be provided by the staff 
of business computer consultants at the 
Watertown store. In response to cus- 
tomer demand, Microcon Software- 
Centers has expanded its services to in- 
clude microcomputer hardware sales. 



Current plans call for the opening of 
twenty-five more stores in the next ten 
months and thirty-five more within two 
years. 

Joanna Tamer has been named 
executive vice president of Microcon 
SoftwareCenters International. She will 
be responsible for all aspects of opera- 
tions, including staffing, management 
control systems, planning, and corpo- 
rate development. As president of Small 
Office Strategies since 1976, Tamer has 
provided management consulting ser- 
vices to entrepreneurs, start-up busi- 
nesses, and companies in stages of rapid 
expansion, participating in the establish- 
ment and development of Computer Pic- 
tures Corporation, the Joy of Movement 
Center, and Elgin International. She de- 
veloped the Design Log Method, a data 
management system for architects and 
developers, in 1977. 

□ MicroGram Systems Group, a San 
Diego software developer, has an- 
nounced the acquisition of the software 
division of Executive Island, taking over 
marketing and development of further 
enchancements of Executive Island's 
Real Estate Analysis and Listing Sys- 
tem, a group of CP/M menu-driven in- 
teractive programs for the analysis of in- 
come properties, including shopping cen- 
ters, office buildings, apartments, and in- 
dustrial complexes. 

□ Southwestern Data Systems (Santee, 
CA) is preparing Demo+Plus, a dealer 
support package featuring a software 
demonstration kit containing every soft- 
ware package SDS has ever produced, in- 
cluding manuals and all necessary hard- 
ware, plus publishing information for 
programmers, monthly press releases, 
and price list updates. 

Dealer comments or suggestions for 
improvement or expansion of the pro- 
gram prior to production are welcome. 

□ Digital Research (Pacific Grove, CA) , 
the developer of CP/M, has announced a 
general restructuring of its organization. 

Two strategic business centers, or- 
ganizational subunits that function like 
separate companies, have been formed 
around language and operating systems. 
Each will have its own product develop- 
ment and marketing departments. An in- 
ternational SBC has been formed for all 
company sales and support in Europe, 
working with Vector International of Bel- 
gium. 

Finance and administration has as- 
sumed responsibility for EDP auto- 
mation, transferred its shipping and re- 
ceiving responsibilities to the manu- 
facturing group, and passed its order pro- 



JUNE 1982 



cessing responsibility to the operations 
group, established to manage inside sales 
and order processing, customer ser- 
vices, marketing communications, tech- 
nical support services, documentation, 
training, and legal services. 

The manufacturing group will also 
handle inventory, assembly, and disk 
production. This group will supply all 
company products. 

An external sales group, formed to de- 
velop the company's domestic OEM and 
distributor sales organization, will estab- 
lish a technical support organization 
throughout the U.S. 

According to Gary Kildall, company 
founder and president, "This change is 
the fourth step in Digital Research's de- 
velopment. The first step was to include 
the participation of venture capital firms. 
Next, we acquired a language company 
and entered into an agreement to ac- 
quire a second. Third, we added more 
management expertise. Now, we are 
consolidating those steps and formal- 
izing a tighter structure. Our goals are l^o 
continue to grow and respond to industry 
needs." 

Digital Research recently announced 
the elimination of run-time library 
royalties for their languages, and enter- 
ed into an agreement with Micro Focus 
to market CP/M-generic-based CIS Co- 
bol and Level II Cobol. 

□ James Lawson has been appointed 
vice president of marketing and sales for 
Evotek, a recently formed designer and 
manufacturer of SH-inch Winchester 
disk drives. He will be responsible for do- 
mestic and international sales and mar- 
keting programs, bringing to the compa- 
ny his experience as vice president of 
sales for the western division of Soft- 
ware International, national sales man- 
ager for Honeywell's printer division, 
and three years with Sperry-Univac in 
Houston. 

□ A new approach to computer graphics 
has been developed by the Conographics 
Corporation (Newport Beach, CA) . 
Called Conography, it allows a number of 
curve parameters to be translated into 
the X, y, and z grid axes, which then de- 
fine the curve through a couple of 
equations. The resulting figure can have 
any degree of curve and orientation. 

The Conographic company is de- 
veloping a new board containing Conog- 
raphy graphics to replace the graphics 
board in the IBM personal computer, and 
is trying to interest Apple in producing 
a similar board for their computers. 

□ Greg Stale, general manager of Conti- 
nental Software (Los Angeles, Califor- 
nia), has announced several new ap- 
pointments. Ray Watt has taken the po- 
sition of account executive, and Mary 
Watt is the company's new accounting 
manager. Jim Densmore and Richard 
West will be complementing the cus- 
tomer support staff, and Dr. Robert 
Wells is handling technical writing and 
serving as company project coordinator. 

□ James S. Campbell, president of Shu- 




gart Associates, presented a gold-plated 
version of his company's minifloppy disk 
drive recently to Wes Cantrell, president 
of Lanier Business Products. It was the 
one millionth drive made by Shugart, 
which invented the minifloppy drive in 
1976, and has been selling them to Lanier 
since 1977. Campbell said that Lanier 
was presented the drive in recognition of 
a mutually successful customer/vendor 
relationship. 

□ The New Century Data Corporation of 

Santa Rosa, California, is in the process 
of establishing a nationwide network of 
franchises that will provide computer 
hardware, software, and consulting ser- 
vices. The stores will operate under the 
name Supertec. In addition to retailing 



181 

most types of microcomputers, they will 
custom-design computer systems based 
on the needs of the user and provide cus- 
tom software. New Century Data is cur- 
rently evaluating the proposals of forty- 
seven prospective franchisers from 
seventeen states and plans to have 137 
consulting groups franchised by 1985. 

The ideal candidate for a franchise is, 
not surprisingly, anyone with a strong 
background in hardware, software, and 
systems, rather than retailing. A fran- 
chise will require an initial $5,000 fee and 
a 3V2 percent monthly fee thereafter. As 
part of obtaining a franchise, dealers will 
be provided with training in all aspects of 
marketing. NCD will provide on-site start- 
up assistance. 



ASSEMBLER/TEACHER 



This program makes your APPLE* teach you assembler! We 
assume you know BASIC already, and now you'd like to learn 
APPLE* assembler. You need three things (two heavies and a 
friend) . . . 

1 . The APPLE II Reference Manual (heavy), 

2. A good 6502 assembler manual (another heavy: ask for both 
at your APPLE* dealer), and 

3. ASSEMBLER TEACHER, a friendly program that takes you 
right through the learning barrier! 

ASSEMBLER TEACHER will soon have you eating those manuals for 
breakfast. And you'll never outgrow ASSEMBLER TEACHER, since it 
has tools an expert can use even more than a novice. Here's how

Everyone's Guide to Assembly 
Language, Part Zl 

Last month we looked at how the Apple hi-res screen is set 
up and at how each dot on the screen is linked to a bit-position 
of a byte in memory. 

This month we'll present a more detailed explanation of 
plotting a point, and more specifically, provide routines for 
some new ways of plotting to the hi-res screen. 

Normal Point Plotting. Last month we saw that the hi-res 
screen colors are mapped out from memory according to the 
scheme illustrated in figure 1. 

You'll remember that we could access either the violet/ 
green or blue /orange dot pairs depending on whether or not the 
high order bit (bit 7) of the byte in question was set. To plot a 
color dot on the screen we need to carry out the following steps. 

1. Use the Y coordinate to determine which horizontal 
screen line to plot on. Because the lines are not mapped con- 
tinuously, a special routine is used to calculate the base ad- 
dress. In this case the term refers to the address associated 
with the first byte on the line given by Y. 

In normal Applesoft, this base address is called GBAS 
(for Graphics BASe address) and is stored in the byte pair 
$26,27. Location $E6 (HP AG) is used to indicate whether the 
plot is to be one on page 1 or page 2 of the hi-res screen.

CALCULATES BAS 
ADDRESS FOR Y-COORD 
IN ACCUMULATOR. 
GBAS = ADDRESS OF 
1ST BYTE OF LINE 



As it happens, we can use the HPOSN ($F411) routine in Ap- 
plesoft to do this calculation for us, but the above listing is pro- 
vided for your entertainment, and for possible use if you should 
decide to write an Applesoft-independent routine. 

2. Once the base address of the horizontal line has been de- 
termined, the position of the byte relative to the left edge needs 
to be established. Because seven dots are stored on each byte, 
the byte we need to access can be determined by dividing the 
X coordinate by 7. This result is stored in location $E5 (HNDX 
= Horizontal iNDeX) . It will be used later by putting the con- 
tents of $E5 into the Y register for an LDA ($26) ,Y operation — 
but more on that later. 

3. The color mask needs to be set up. The color mask is a bit 
pattern that shows which bits in a byte are acceptable possi- 
bilities for a plot. The color mask is stored in location $E4 
(COLBYTE). Rather than literally calculating, Applesoft 
stores all the possible color masks starting at location $F6F6 
(see figure 2). 

Ones and zeros are used to indicate which dots are on and 
which are off for the color indicated. Blackl is the simplest; 
black is achieved by turning any dot off. Whitel is its con- 
verse, achieved by turning on any dot by a plot. Note that bit 7 
does not correspond to a displayed dot and is left a zero (high 
bit off) . 

If you compare the color mask for green and violet to the 
chart in figure 1, you'll note that the ones match the available 
dots for the given color in a byte. Remember, the order of the

bits is reversed when mapping to the screen, so that bit 0 to bit 
7 are mapped left to right on the screen. 

The second set of masks on the left are the colors with the 
high-bit set (bit 7 = 1) . The same pattern as before is used, ex- 
cept that the high bit is set for all four colors. 

Looking at figure 1 again, you'll note that the masks shown 
on the left will work for all even-addressed bytes, that is, such 
bytes as $2000, $2002, and so on. For the odd-addressed bytes 
($2001, $2003, and so on) , the colors are shifted one bit position. 
When HPOSN is called, along with determining GBAS, it 
checks the HNDX calculated, and if that is an odd address, 
shifts the color byte. The result, whether shifted or not, is al- 
ways put in location $1C (HCOLORl). The results of such a 
possible shift are shown on the right side of figure 2. 

(An interesting result of this process is that you cannot 
clear the entire screen to an actual color [green, violet, blue, or 
orange] by filling memory with a single value. Try it. Clear the 
hi-res screen with an hgr, then enter the Monitor with call 
-151. Then type in: 

*2000:2A 

*2001<2000.3FFFM 

The screen should clear to alternate vertical bars of green and 
violet.) 

4. Now the actual bit position of interest needs to be select- 
ed. This actually has already been done by HPOSN. The result 
of the X coordinate divided by seven was put in HNDX and the 
remainder of that division just happens to correspond to the ac- 
tual bit position within the byte we want. The only remaining 
problem then is that the result is a number from 0 to 6, and 
what we need is a byte with only that particular bit turned on. 
This is again derived from a table within Applesoft (in this 
case starting at $F5B2) . The result from this table is then put in 
location $30 (HMASK). For the table at $F5B2 see figure 3. 

Now at last we're ready to do the actual plot. The plotting 
sequence (normally found at $F45A) looks like this: 



LDY HNDX 
LDA HCOLORl 
EOR (GBAS),Y 
AND HMASK 
EOR (GBAS),Y 
STA (GBAS),Y 



LDY $E5 
LDA $1C 
EOR ($26),Y 
AND $30 
EOR ($26),Y 
STA (GBAS),Y 



This last operation is probably best clarified with an actual 
example. 
Given :

(Note: the bits shown here for each byte are broken into four bit sets for 
clarity.)

Procedure : 

1. JSR $F3E2 (HGR) 

Clears the hi-res screen. Sets HP AG ($E6) to $20. 

2. LDX #$01 

JSR $F6F0 (HCOLOR) 

This puts the mask value %00101010 in HCOLORl ($E4) . 

3. LDX X (LOW ORDER BYTE of the X coordinate) 
LDY X+1 (HIGH ORDER BYTE or X) 

LDA Y (Y coordinate) 
JSR HPOSN 

Note that the percent sign (%) in the mask value is used to in- 
dicate the binary form of a number. This form is used in the re- 
mark portions of many of the source listings in this series as an 
added aid to the explanations. Although some assemblers al- 
low binary numbers in the operand, we have limited their use 
here to the remark field to reduce compatibility problems. 
This will: 

a. Calculate the base address using the page index at $E36 
(usually $20) . In this case the result will be $2000. The re- 
sult is stored in GBAS, GBAS-l-1 ($26,27) 

b. Divide 15 (the X coordinate) by 7. The result (2) is put 
in HNDX ($E5) . The remainder of the division (1) is used to 
access the bit mask table. The result of this table lookup 
(%1000 0010 found at $F5B3,X where X = 1) is put in 
HMASK ($30). 

c. Check HNDX to see if the byte offset is odd. If so, shift 
the color byte mask. Since in this case $E5 holds a 2, no shift 
is required. Thus the color mask %0010 1010 is put in 
HCOLORl ($1C) in preparation for the plot. 

4. JSR $F45A (HPLOT) 
This completes the process with:

The net effect of step 4 is to say: "Look at the bit mask pat- 
tern and compare it to the color mask. If there is a one in the 
color mask at the given dot position, turn that dot on (set the bit 
to one) f If there's a zero at that position, turn the dot off (clear 
bit to zero)." 

Alternate Plotting Modes. So far, all we have really done is 
to explain further something we were already using. This new 
explanation makes possible some alternative ways of plotting 
to the hi-res screen. In fact, by using the existing Applesoft rou- 
tines, the new routines are rather short and, best of all, easy to 
explain. If you are unsettled right now about the finer details of 
the masking operations, don't worry. The real point of all that 
is to give you some feel for the general processes involved. 

For starters, let's review some basic problems encoun- 
tered so far with the normal Applesoft hplot. The first problem 
arises when you are trying to plot using just one color. By set- 
ting hcolor equal to 1,2,5, or 6, we limit the possible dots which 
can be plotted to every other dot on the normal screen. This 
can be disconcerting when you have a statement like : 

HCOLOR=l: HPLOT 100,100 

and nothing happens. The reasons for this were discussed in 
earlier issues, but now it should be even more obvious that the 
color mask specifies only odd-dot positions for hcolor =1, mak- 
ing it impossible to plot at X=100. 

The second problem occurs when you're plotting with 
hcolor=3 or hcolor=7. Even though we have specified white, an

attempt to plot a single point always comes out as a colored 
dot. It is only when drawing more than one point (such as in a 
line) that white appears. 

Let's examine possible solutions to these problems. 

140-Point Resolution Mode. For the first problem of invisi- 
ble points, one solution is to accept that there are only 140 
points available for a given color, and to alter our frame of ref- 
erence to recognize that reality. 

An easy way of doing this is to always work with an X coor- 
dinate value in the range of 0 to 139, and then to double the 
value when actually doing the hplot. The main drawback to 
this approach is the speed loss during the multiplications, and 
the fact that odd color values must also be shifted by one (since 
odd colors can only plot at odd X positions) . The situation now 
would look like this: 



HCOLOR=2 
X=15: Y = 30 
HPLOT X*2,Y 



or 



HCOLOR=l 
X = 20: Y=30 
HPLOT X*2+1,Y 



Another approach is to create a machine language routine 
to do this for us automatically. Here's the source listing for 
such a routine.

This program is designed to be called from Applesoft, serv- 
ing as a subroutine for an undefined overall program. The ad- 
vantage of the routine is that hcolor may be set to any value, 
although white will still only plot one color. Values for the X co- 
ordinate may range from 0 to 139. 



Assuming that the routine is loaded starting at location $300 
(768 decimal) , the syntax for calling it would be : 

CALL 768, X, Y 

where X and Y are the coordinates for the desired plot. 

Examining the listing, you will see that the first step is to 
use the calls to Applesoft on lines 25 through 27 to retrieve the X 
coordinate from Applesoft. The resulting two-byte representa- 
tion for the value will end up in LINNUM ($50,51). 

Once we have the value for X, the remaining process is 
very straightforward. The X coordinate is doubled by the pair 
of left shifts on lines 29,30. Next, the color byte is checked to see 
if the hcolor previously selected was an odd or even color 
value. A brief look at the color mask chart in figure 2 shows 
that bit 1 (rather than bit 0) is the key to whether a color is odd 
or even. If the color is odd, LINNUM is incremented by one to 
select the next odd X-coordinate position. 

The Y coordinate is then retrieved using COMBYTE. Since 
Y cannot be larger than 191, the one-byte retrieval routine can 
be used. 

At that point, the usual call to hplot is done with the new X 
coordinate. 

A little rumination on this routine should convince you that 
it is functionally identical to this Basic algorithm: 

0 HGR: HOME: VTAB 22 

10 INPUT "HCOLOR";C : HCOLOR = C 

20 INPUT "COORDINATES:";X,Y 

30 X = X * 2 

40 IF C/2 < > INT (C/2) THEN X = X + 1 
50 HPLOT X,Y 

The machine language routine given can always be used di- 
rectly from other machine language programs by deleting 
lines 25 through 27 and changing 44 and 45 to read LDY Y. The 
routine would then be called by putting the X coordinate de- 
sired in LINNUM ($50,51), and the Y coordinate in Y ($E2). 

560-Point Resolution Mode. The disadvantage of the 140- 
point method just shown is that the resolution of the graphics Is 
obviously limited. This is particularly apparent in attempts to 
draw near- vertical ines; it's easy to observe the degree of 
stairstepping that occurs. Low-resolution plotting modes pro- 
duce very broken vertical lines. 

If color is not a concern (such as when using a black and 
white monitor), then why not just plot using white? Because 
we won't know that the colors are actually varying depending 
on the X coordinate specified, a black and wWte display will 
look fine. 

Well, if that's the case, then you might as well go for all you 
can get and use the 560-point mode. The theory to this mode Is 
that the high-order bit of each screen byte can be used to 
choose between dots shifted one half position with respect to 
the usual 280-point mode. The argument against this method Is 
that the plotting of dots within the same hyte can distort the 
first byte plotted. 

For example, if the first dot plotted is on the farthest left 
possible position (high bit off) , then a successive plot of any 
hcolor with the high bit set {hcolor=4 through 7) will change 
the color of the dot and shift it to the right. As it happens, this is 
not much of an argument since the same holds true for the nor- 
mal 280-point mode, and even for the 140-polnt mode. The ines- 
capable fact is that plotting two colors with conflicting high bit 
conditions within the same byte will always affect the first dot 
plotted. If the distortion is unavoidable then you might as well 
enjoy the benefits of the higher resolution, especially if you're 
going to have to cope with the distortion problem anjrway. 

Without further introduction, here then is the routine Im- 
plementing the 560-polnt plotting mode. 

Like the PLOT.140 routine, this is assumed to be loaded at 
$300 and would be called in a manner Identical to that for the 
previous routine: 

call 768, X, Y 

The main difference here Is that X can now have a range of 
0 to 559, and that hcolor is always set to white. As with normal

COOL STACK -SENTRY II $175.00 




COOL STACK - SENTRY II 

The COOL STACK Sentry II offers the features of locking, cooling, easy tilt action access, and 
efficient organization and storage for the APPLE II computer system, all in one compact unit The 
precision all steel construction is designed for optimum strength and durability. An attractive tex- 
tured finish is color matched to the Apple II. 

IT LOCKS 

The Apple II computer is easily fastened securely to a base plate utilizing existing holes in the 
Apple mainframe, thereby eliminating any modification or permanent attachment to the computer. 
The disk drives are also easily fastened securely to the middle shelf of the COOL STACK utilizing 
existing holes in the bottom of the drives. An adhesion plate is optionally attached to a table 
top with adhesives provided. A high quality lock easily snaps in place to secure the entire unit. 
The Sentry II can be easily attached or removed from the adhesion plate only when the system is 
unlocked 

IT COOLS 

The cooling effectiveness of the COOL STACK is an answer to overheating usually resulting from 
added function boards in the Apple II computer. The COOL STACK greatly increases the life 
and reliability of the computer and peripheral function boards. 

Fresh air is forced into the computer and blows across the components through a foam enclosure 
surrounding the open slot area. The hot air is forced out through the open slots on the opposite 
side, the back and bottom of the computer and the keyboard A high quality low noise fan is 
used that was engineered and tested to get the job done efficiently 

IT TILTS 

The COOL STACK can be easily tilted away from the Apple II computer allowing easy access 
to the inside of the computer and plug-in cards. 

IT STORES 

Another much enjoyed feature of COOL STACK is the efficient and attractive organization it 
offers for the typical Apple II system. Either one or two disk drives can be stored on the shelf. 
The COOL STACK, being constructed of 16 gauge steel, also acts as a shield between the monitor 
and the disk drives, thus helping protect disks from being erased or interrupted by monitor radiation. 
An adjustable library rack provides convenient storage for manuals and disks. 

COOL STACK - STANDARD 

For those who do not need the extra security and frequent super easy access to the Apple II, the 
standard COOL STACK offers the same cooling and system organization as the Sentry II.

The operation of this routine is also fairly simple. As with 
the PLOT.140 program, the value for X is retrieved from the 
calling program. In this case though, CALC divides the passed 
value by two. Note that a left-shift operation is used, not the 
right shifts (for a multiply) that were used in the 140- mode. 

You'll recall that LSR LINNUM+l (LSR = Left Shift 
Right) will shift all bits in LINNUM+l (the high order byte) to

the right one position, forcing a zero at the right-most position, 
and putting the old bit zero in the carry. 

This is immediately followed by the ROR (for ROtate 
Right) instruction which again shifts all the bits in LINNUM 
(the low-order byte), puts the carry into bit 7, and drops the 
last bit 0 into the carry, thus replacing the old value. 

Example: X COORD = 289 = $121 = %0000 0001 0010 0001 

LINNUM-l-l LINNUM 
LSR LINNUM-l-l: %0000 0001 -> %0000 0000 (Carry=l) 

! 

(C) < — I 

ROR LINNUM: %0010 0001 -> %1001 0000 (Carry=l) 

A I 
!-(C) < — ! 

The rather coincidental beauty of this is that the carry flag 
will end up being set or cleared depending on whether the orig- 
inal value for X was odd or even. This is needed because in the 
560-point mode, we'll use the odd or even nature of X to deter- 
mine whether to set the high bit or not.

201 


100 


White 2 (bit 7 = 1) 


501 


250 


White 2 (bit 7= 1) 



Basically what we do is to divide the X coordinate by two to 
get a value acceptable to normal Applesoft, and then force the 
color to be either whitel or white2 depending on how we want 
the high bit set in the final plot. 

Lines 28 through 32 set the color mask to the appropriate 
value by checking the carry flag to see if the original value of X 
was odd or even. Then LINNUM is transferred to our actual X- 
coordinate bytes. The routine is then completed with the usual 
call to hplot, as was done in the PLOT.140 routine. 

This process could be simulated from Applesoft with the fol- 
lowing routine: 

0 HGR: HOME: VTAB 22 

10 INPUT "COORDINATES?",X,Y 

20 HCOLOR = 3 : REM WHITE 1 

30 IF X/2 < > INT(X/2) THEN HCOLOR = 7: 

REM WHITE2 FOR X=ODD 
40 X = X/2 
50 HPLOT X,Y 

It's likely, however, that you'll find the machine language 
routine considerably faster, and certainly much easier to im- 
plement. 

A Demonstration Program. To give you something to show 
off these routines, here's a program in Applesoft that will call 
both routines and show the differences in their appearances. 

10 D$ = CHR$ (4) 
100 REM NORMAL TEST 
110 HGR : HCOLOR= 3 
120 FOR I = 0 TO 100 
130 HPLOT 1,1 
140 NEXT I 

200 REM PLOT.140 TEST 

205 PRINT D$;"BLOAD PLOT.140,A$300" 

210 FOR I = 0 TO 100 

220 CALL 768,1,1 

230 NEXT I 

300 REM PLOT. 560 TEST 

305 PRINT D$;"BLOAD PLOT.560,A$300" 

310 FOR I = 0 TO 100 

320 CALL 768,1,1 

330 NEXT I 

Notice that this program loads each routine from a disk file 
as it's needed. Basically this illustrates the steepest vertical 
angle at which a line can be drawn without any noticeable 



stairstepping, or breaking, in the line. It also conveniently 
shows a perhaps unexpected change in the actual visual result 
of the plot, even though all three lines were done with similar 
for-next loops. 

Normally, the 280-point mode is conveniently proportional. 
That is to say, a move of five points horizontally on the screen 
is about the same actual distance on the screen as a move of 
five points vertically. This ensures that a square will in fact 
look "square" when drawn on the screen. Thus the first plot is 
at the "proper" 45 degrees when drawn using hplot 1,1. 

When the number of screen points is halved, as in the case 
of the PLOT.140 routine, the result will be to "stretch" the 
screen horizontally by a factor of two. Similarly, packing twice 
as many points (namely 560 versus 240) across has the effect of 
compressing the screen. These effects must be considered 
when doing geometric designs on the screen. 

We'll leave it as an exercise for you to draw three parallel 
lines using each of the three modes. 

By now, you've probably also noticed some minor flaws in 
the clarity of the 560-point line. 

Next month we'll explore the matter further, discovering 
why the faint spots occur, and how to fix them. 

Have fun! 



Please note the following correction to the February 1982 
Assembly Lines. The listing for the Real Variable Sender rou- 
tine had an error on lines 19 and 20 of the source listing. The 
listing for those lines should have read: 

0303: AD 81 03 19 LDA DATA -1-1 

0306: AC 80 03 20 LDY DATA 

The listing given had the DATA and DATA -1-1 bytes 
reversed, which would have accordingly reversed the low and 
high order bytes in calculating the final result.

After memorizing the location of the on-off switch on my 
16K cassette Apple, my main frustration as a beginning pro- 
grammer became my inability to save keyboard input from 
within a program. I would write a program that asked ques- 
tions, but then the only way to save the typed-in answers wa^ 
on a printout (very difficult without a printer). Then along 
came a little black and white box called Disk n, and my prob- 
lems were solved. The instruction book said I could create Text 
Files. Oh boy! But then a question arose . . . 



you or some other key-banger wrote, and you want to check it 
out? Well, you came to the right place 'cause here's a way to do 
it. Read along; maybe we'll both learn something. 

First, let's write an Applesoft program that asks questions 
of (gets input from) the Human At the Computer Keyboard 
(H.A.C.K.?): 



100 
110 



INPUT "WHAT? 
GOTO 100 



A$ 



What Is a Text File? A text file is simply a series of words 
separated by carriage returns and stored on disk. The words 
may range in length from 0 to 255 characters. All characters 
except carriage returns (control-Ms) are legal. You will rec- 
ognize a text file in your catalog by the T that appears to the 
left of the sector number. 

You can't run or load text files (you'll get a "file tjrpe mis- 
match" message if you try) , but you can read them or write to 
them from within a progfram. You can also exec some text 
files, as we'll discuss later on. Text files are stored or saved 
onto disk with DOS's write command and retrieved or loaded 
with the read command. Both read and write need the help of 
the open and close commands. 

Some Words about Control-D. We're about to write and use 
a few programs that perform some DOS commands. To do 
this, we'll need to use DOS's control-D or CHR$(4) command 
character in front of our commands. We'll assume you've read 
your DOS Manual (only the interesting parts, of course), and 
know how to perform simple DOS commands from your pro- 
grams, like: 

10 D$=CHR$(4): REM (control-D) 
20 PRINT D$; "CATALOG" 

We'll assume you've run into the problem of this method 
not working in situations like this: 

10 D$ = CHR$(4); REM (control-D) 

15 PRINT "POPSCICLE";: REM (with semi-colon) 

20 PRINT D$; "CATALOG" 

For whatever reason, control-D has to be "printed" (invisi- 
bly) at the left margin of your screen for the command that fol- 
lows to be executed. So if your cursor is stranded out at htab 10, 
as in the example, print D$; "catalog" will do just that, print 
the word catalog, nothing more, and not catalog your disk. 

Well,, Jet's fix that problem forever. From now on, use: 

D$=CHR$(13)-I-CHR$(4) 

Now there will be a carriage return (CHR$13) or control-M) 
printed before every control-D, always placing the control-D 
on the left side of your screen. 

A Read- Any-Text- File Utility! As you know, you can load 
and list Applesoft and Integer Basic programs and even bload 
and peek at binary files, but what if you have a text file that 



Not bad! Do you realize you could learn everything a per- 
son ever knew with that program ! ? What happens in line 100 
is that the human at the keyboard sees the question "What?" 
on the screen, types his answer, and then hits a carriage re- 
turn. The carriage return, in a way, is the last "character" of 
his answer. 

Now, we're going to expand the program and pretend that 
your disk drive is the human at the keyboard. When we read a 
text file, that's exactly what we're doing; we're getting inpuf 
from the disk. So, let's precede our input routine with open and 
read statements and follow it by a close command. Here's the 
program. Type it in, save it and then run: 

10 TEXT : HOME : PRINT "THIS PROGRAM WILL READ ANY TEXT FILE." 

20 FOR I = 1 TO 40: PRINT "-";: NEXT 

30 INPUT "NAME OF FILE!";F$ 

40 D$ = CHR$ (13) -I- CHR$ (4) 

50 PRINT D$;"MONICO" 

60 PRINT D$;"VERIFY ";F$ 

70 PRINT D$,"OPEN ";F$ 

80 PRINT D$;"READ ",F$ 

90 ONERR GOTO 120 

100 INPUT "";A$ 

110 GOTO 100 

120 PRINT D$;"CLOSE ";F$ 

This program should read any standard-DOS text file. Dig 
around; you should be able to find one someplace (there's one 
on the System Master Disk) . The text file you read may be a 
list of words of names, a series of commands, or a combina- 
tion of the two. You may get a few confounded "?extra ig- 
nored" messages, because of encounters with commas and 
colons (we'll get to this later), but no problem; the commas, 
colons, and words that follow will print. 

Let's see what makes this program do its thing. 

Lines 10-30 print a title and get the name of the text file we 
want to read. Line 40 's D$ was discussed earlier. 

Line 50's monico sort of tells the Apple to print what it's 
"thinking about." A better command here might have been 
mon I (MONiior /nput) but for now, let's not be choosy. See Ap- 
ple's DOS Manual for more. They'll tell you, by the way, to use 
mon i,c,o, but who has time to type all of those unnecessary 
commas? 

Line 60's verify is a trick that checks to see if the text file we 
are looking for is actually on ovir disk. Verify is a DOS com- 
mand of questionable value (until now)-. If the file you asked 



192 M \ n\. 

for in line 30 doesn't exist (maybe you spelled it wrong) , the 
program will stop with a "file not found" message; it tried to 
verify the program but couldn't find it. Had we not used veri- 
fy, the next command, line 70's open, wouldn't have found the 
file either, but it would have created a file for you, a useless 
one-sector empty file (spelled wrong and everything) in your 
catalog. Just what you don't need. 

By line 70, the Apple knows the file exists, so it opens it. 
Text files have to be opened before you can write to them or 
read them. 

Line 80 tells the program to read the text file. After opening 
a text file, we have to say whether we want to read from or 
ivrite to the disk. 

Line 90, onerr goto 120 is going to watch for the end of our 
text file; more on this later. 

Lines 100-110 are where the real action takes place. The in- 
put statement asks the question and the disk drive answers by 
reading data from the disk, storing it in memory and (option- 
ally) printing it to the screen or printer. Every time a carriage 
return is encountered in the text file, the Apple considers the 
question or input answered, so the program continues to the 
next (in this case, the same) question. Incidentally, if you use 
input ""; A$ instead of input A$, you don't get a column of 
question marks printed to the left of the data coming in from 
the disk. You could also use input "data: "; A$ or something 
similar. This would also prevent ?s. 

Sooner or later, the program will encounter the end of the 
text file. Line 100 will ask for more input and the file will have 
nothing left in it. Normally, if you ask too many questions of a 
text file, you will get an "end of data" error message (not 
"?out of data" ; that's another story) . Instead of a crash, good 
old onerr goto takes over and does a jump to line 120. 

Line 120 closes the file for us. Just as you have to open text 
files when you read or write, you have to close them. You ac- 
tually don't need to use the file name after close, but it doesn't 
hurt. By the way, close is one of the DOS commands you can 
use in immediate-execution mode. Open, read, and write, how-

ever, may only be used In a program [deferred execution) . 

Sequential Text Files. Now we're going to write the sim- 
plest kind of text file. Sequential text files best fit our defini- 
tion — "a series of words separated by carriage returns." Ap- 
ple's other type of text file, random access files, are just a bit 
more complex. The objective of the two programs below is 
first to get some names from the human at the keyboard and 
then to save (write) the names on disk so we can turn off the 
Apple and retrieve (read) the names next Tuesday after work. 

First, here's a program that will get the names we want to 
store : 

10 REM "WRITE" PROGRAM 

20 TEXT : HOME : NORMAL 

30 MAX = 100: DIM NAME$(MAX) 

40 N = N -I- 1 

50 PRINT "TYPE NAME §":H; 

60 INPUT ":";NAME$(N) 

70 IF LEN (N/i^ME$(N)) > 0 and N < MAX THEN 40 

80 N= N - 1: PRINT : PRINT 

90 INPUT "NAME OF FILE TO BE WRITTEN:";F$ 

100 D$ = CHR$ (13) + CHR$ (4) 

110 PRINT D$;"MONICO" 

120 PRINT D$;"OPEN ";F$ 

130 PRINT D$;"DELETE ";F$ 

140 PRINT D$;"OPEN ";F$ 

150 PRINT D$;"WRITE ";F$ 

160 PRINT N 

170 FOR X = 1 TO N 

180 PRINT NAME$(X) 

190 NEXT X 

200 PRINT D$;"CLOSE" 

Lines 10-70 get our names from the keyboard for us and 
store them in memory as a name$ string array. If return is 
pressed without typing a name, then the length (len) of 
name$(N) is zero (line 70) the input is discontinued, and N is 
decreased by one (in line 80 ; because no name number N was 
entered) . Line 30's max and dim name$(max) determine the 
maximum number of names allowed by the program. Unfor-

tunately, you have to assign this value first; you can't in- 
crease it as you go along. 

Line 90 lets you name the text file about to be written. Any 
legal file name is okay (It must start with an upper or lower 
case A-Z or a control character or one of twelve other special 
characters and it must contain no commas). 

Lines 100-140 open our name file almost as we did in our 
"Read Anjrthing" program. Line 130, however, uses a com- 
mon trick to prevent a common problem. After the file is 
opened, we delete it whether or not it appeared on the disk 
when we started. Nothing is lost; we're about to write (or re- 
write) the file anyway. 

The thing is that if we are rewriting a text file shorter than 
it was, the end of the file we are writing to will not be overwrit- 
ten and will appear at the end of our new file. You don't need to 
worry about this when you save an Applesoft program under 
the same name as a longer one, but here you worry. After the 
file has been opened and deleted, we must open it again (line 
140). 

Line 150 initiates the write process. Everything that is print- 
ed in quotes or outside quotes will now be written to the disk. If 
we want the printed or written words to show on the screen, we 
use the print D$; "mono" or mon ice command. If we don't, we 
use nomono or nomon ico. 

Lines 160-190 write the pertinent information — the number 
of names in our file and the names themselves. It is important 
that we write the number of names as the first piece of data be- 
cause later, when we retrieve the file, we will be asking for a 
number as the first piece of data. 

Line 200 closes the file. No more lines; end of program. 

After running the above program and entering a couple of 
short test names, catalog your disk. You should see a T (for 
"Text") file, probably two sectors in length, depending on the 
number and length of the names you entered. Save the pro- 
gram on disk by typing save write program. Now type FP or 
new and we'll write a program that will read our textfile: 

10 REM "READ" PROGRAM 

20 TEXT : HOME : NORMAL 

30 MAX = 100: DIM NAME$(MAX) 

40 INPUT "NAME OF FILE TO BE READ:";F$ 

50 D$ = CHR$ (13) + CHR$ (4) 

60 PRINT D$;"MONICO" 

70 PRINT D$;"VERIFY ",F$ 

80 PRINT D$;"OPEN ";F$ 

90 PRINT D$;"READ ";F$ 

100 INPUT "";N 

110 FOR X = 1 TO N 

120 INPUT "";NAMES(X) 

130 NEXT X 

140 PRINT D$;"CLOSE" 

Notice how input statements are used in lines 100 and 120. 
We are again asking questions of the disk drive. Assuming our 
read program (this one) and our write program are compati- 
ble, everything should work fine. Of course, you will want to do 
something with your names ; this program Just gets them for 
you. Maybe you want to be able to add a few names or delete a 
couple, and write them back into the text file, or alphabetize 
and. . . . But before you go any farther, you should renumber 
these two programs and append them, giving you the options 
of reading and writing from the same program. As you can 
see, this could be the start of something big. 

The #@&? Extra Ignored Problem. There's a Basic conflict 
here that gets in the way of writing all-purpose textfiles, and 
that's Applesoft's confounded dislike of any input that con- 
tains a comma or a colon. Any answer you give to an input 
statement is chopped off at the first comma or colon, and to 
make things worse you get an ugly "?extra ignored" printed 
on top of your previously neat screen layout (at least it doesn't 
beep twelve times) . Even if you come up with some words or 
strings that already contain commas or colons (as in "Smith, 
John") and write them to a textfile, you can't read them back 
into memory with input statements (thanks to mon ico, you 
can get them printed on the screen) . 

Enough complaining. Let's do something about it. 



60 
70 



INPUT "WHAT'S YOUR NAME? ";A$ 
PRINT "THANKS, ";A$;"!" 



Run this program, and answer "SMITH, JOHN" (with a 
comma) to the question. The Apple prints: 

? EXTRA IGNORED 
THANKS SMITH! 

(instead of "THANKS SMITH, JOHN!") 

Now the solution: There's a nice subroutine built into your 
Apple that can be utilized by a call-657. The subroutine is real- 
ly sort of an input function that just loves commas and colons. 
"The problem is, it sticks your "input" into the input buffer at 
memory location 512 ($200-$3FF) and you have to dig it out. 
Here's one way to do it: 

60 PRINT "WHAT'S YOUR NAME? ";: REM (thafs PRINT, not INPUT) 
65 CALL -657: A$ = "": FOR X = 512 TO 767: P = PEEK(X): 

IF P <> 141 THEN A$ = A$ -I- CHR$(P)! NEXT X 
80 PRINT "THANKS, ";A$;"!" 

A lot of extra work just to get commas and colons, right? 
Line 65 scans each character of the input buffer, adding each 
one to the string A$ until it finds a carriage return (until 
P=141). Use this method in all of your programs if you want. 
Besides solving the comma problem, this routine will accept 
leading spaces as input. You could make line 65 a subroutine 
(with a return in the next line) if you need several inputs in a 
program. 

Mystery of the Month. Another one from Chris Volpe, chief 
Apple mystery man. There is a call called call 42350 that will 
catalog a disk, handy for use with disks where the catalog com- 
mand word may have been altered. Try it; it works. Just type 
call 42350 (return) . Now try it with your drive door open. 'This 
should produce an I/O error message, but no-oo-oo! You get a 
rogram too large message (that's "rogfram," not "pro- 
gram"). 

Well, we don't explain 'em, we just find 'em. See you next 
month.

ik on the APPLE II Computer 
P?^ Is how o reality 





THE APPLE SPELLER fills the void 
that has consistently kept the large 
variety of excellent word processing 
packages for the Apple II Computer 
fronn approaching the power of a 
dedicated work processor. Finally, 
the first professional quality spelling 
verification program is available for 
the Apple II. The Apple Speller will 
certainly be the standard against 
which all other similar programs are 
compared. 

The Apple Speller interfaces to the 
most popular Apple word processors, 
including Applewriter, Apple Pie, 
Executive Secretary, Letter Perfect, 
Magic Window, and Superscribe II, 
just to name a few. In fact, The Apple 
Speller can analyze the output of any 
editor that writes a standard Apple 
binary or text file to a diskette. In 
addition to this flexibility, the per- 
formance of The Apple Speller will 
astound the microcomputer world. 

The Apple Speller is supplied with 
a 30,000+ word dictionary on a 
single 5Va" diskette with additional 
space to easily add another 8,000 
words to suit your individual needs. 



The Apple Speller has built-in utilities 
to maintain the dictionary diskette. 
You can readily add words, delete 
words, and create an unlimited num- 
ber of modified and/or new diction- 
aries for specific application. 

The Apple Speller is unbelievably 
fast. The first pass reads your docu- 
ment and collects all the words it 
contains at a rate of 5,000 words 
per minute. Next, the words are 
compared to the dictionary for spell- 
ing errors at the incredible speed of 
50,000 words per minute. Finally, all 
misspelled words are marked as 
such in your document with a rate 
of 1,000 words per minute. This 
translates to proofreading a 10 page 
document in 1 minute if there are no 
spelling mistakes and 2 minutes, 15 
seconds for an unlimited number of 
spelling errors. 

Numerous options are provided 
throughout the program to enable 
you to completely control all activi- 
ties of The Apple Speller. These 
include the ability to ignore both 
control codes and formatting com- 
mands, an alphabetical listing of 



either mispelled words or all the 
words in your document along with 
usage frequencies, multiple options 
for the action taken with each 
misspelled word, and much, much 
more! A verification mode is pro- 
vided to allow you to examine and 
dispense with misspelled words 
while viewing them in the actual 
context in which they appeared in 
your file. 

The Apple Speller requires an 
Apple ll/Apple 11 + equipped with 48K, 
DOS 3.3, and 1 or 2 disk drives. Two 
disk drives are required to delete or 
add words to the dictionary. 

The Apple Speller is being intro- 
duced at the incredible price of 

$75.00!

□ East Side Story. Leon Watkins is a 
man with a mission in life. For years he 
has been working with gangs in East Los 
Angeles, California. By getting them off 
the street and into a learning environ- 
ment, Watkins, and many others, be- 
lieve it's possible to integrate gang mem- 
bers into constructive social behavior. 

Watkins's latest effort in this area in- 
volve microcomputers. Every Saturday, 
Watkins tours around in an old church 
bus and collects gang members for a trip 
to Data Equipment Supply in Downey. 
Uijder supervision, gang members learn 
about programming and word process- 
ing on Commodore computers. 

Working with a nucleus of gang mem- 
bers who have made the trip before and 
know the ropes, Watkins gathers a few 
new people each weekend. A buddy sys- 
tem is used wherein two or more people 
work together to learn about the 
computer. 

"I'll try anything once," explains 
Watkins. "I didn't have any idea that this 
would last so long. Taking the gangs over 
to Data Equipment has been very suc- 
cessful. We'll keep doing it as long as we 
can." 

The program originated when Com- 
modore loaned fourteen computers to 
Larry Bowder of Data Equipment to help 
start local microcomputer workshops for 
the general public. One workshop was in 
East L.A. and that is how Bowder met 
Watkins. 

Now Saturdays are East L.A. day at 
Data Equipment. Working in conjunc- 
tion with the Los Angeles Police Acade- 
my, Bowder is striving to provide an 
alternative outlet for gang energy. The 
idea is to find an activity that is more fun 
than running with a gang but is also part 
of the real world. 

According to Bowder, "Dissemina- 
tion is not the answer. We try to keep the 
camaraderie found in gangs and let it 
carry over into what they're doing here." 

Each Saturday is broken into thirds. 
The first third is spent on general typing 
skills. The second third involves learning 
basic math through CAI. The last third of 
the day is spent in small workshops 
learning programming skills, word proc- 
essing, and even things like VisiCalc. 

"It's important that they learn some- 
thing that has to do with the real world," 
explains Bowder. "Their attitude starts 
changing when they think they've be- 
come involved. The social interaction 
possible with microcomputers is incredi- 
ble. I sure didn't see it coming and I've 



been in this business for fifteen years." 

The ultimate goal of Watkins and 
Bowder is to have computers in the com- 
munity where the gangs are located. This 
way an individual can take knowledge 
and experience gained at Data Equip- 
ment back to help others learn on their 
own machines locally. 
□ A Fistful of Nickels. Nineteen eighty- 
two's first quarter financial reports are 
in and they show the computer industry 
as a whole reflecting the economic slump 
due to the recession. 

International Business Machines 
racked up $7 biUion in sales, an increase 
of 9 percent over the same period in 1981. 
Reported profits were $768 million, up 5 
percent from last year. The profit mar- 
gin shrank from 11.3 percent to 10.9 per- 
cent. 

The recession and high interest rates 
are bad enough, but inflation drastically 
changes some of the figures released by 
companies. The inflation scoreboard in 
Business Week (May 3, 1982) reports on 
400 companies' profits in 1981 when ad- 
justed for inflation. 

According to the scoreboard, IBM's 
total sales of $29 billion in 1981, with a re- 
ported increase of 11 percent, earned a 
far less impressive 1 percent increase 
over 1980 sales. 

The industry composite for office 
equipment companies shows an inflation- 
adjusted 2 percent increase in sales, far 
from the 13 percent increase garnered 
before inflation. Figtires for the com- 
posite totals were calculated using the fi- 
nancial results of ten companies with a 
total sales of $66 billion. 

Inflation has also taken its toll on prof- 
its. IBM's little more than $3 billion prof- 
it reported for 1981 becomes a little less 
than $2 billion in 1981 dollars. Further 
analysis of four year growth rates shows 
IBM's reported 12 percent increase in 
sales are actually 1 percent after infla- 
tion and profits are down 5 percent in- 
stead of up 5 percent. 

Business Week came to the conclu- 
sion that industries suffer unevenly from 
inflation. After adjusting costs for the 
consumer price index and for changes in 
specific prices, including depreciation 
and cost of goods sold, the best industry is 
office equipment. The current-cost prof- 
its as percent of historical cost is 93 per- 
cent, compared to 83 percent for second- 
place publishing and television. 

The Wall Street Journal attributes 
IBM's slight first quarter profit to de- 
mand for the Personal Computer. With- 



out the Personal Computer, the scene 
would have been even more dismal. 

Apple Computer, on the other hand, 
showed a first quarter profit increase of 
51 percent. Take into account inflation 
and that percentage drops, but Apple is 
still growing at a phenomenal rate. 

With total sales of $335 million in 1981, 
Apple missed the Fortune 500 by about 
$120 million. By contrast, IBM placed 
eighth on the 500, retaining the same po- 
sition it had in 1980. 

IBM's competitors in the office equip- 
ment market may be falling on hard 
times. Control Data showed first quarter 
profits of 5 percent before inflation. Hon- 
eywell showed a profit increase of 8 per- 
cent, attributable in large part to $36 mil- 
lion from the sale of its interest in GE In- 
formation Service. Business Week notes: 
"Without that income, its (Honeywell's) 
profits would have fallen nearly 63 per- 
cent." 

Burroughs reported a first quarter 
profit increase of 22 percent, but indus- 
try analysts attribute this to the acquisi-

tion and exchange of securities. 

The fact remains that the worse the 
economy gets, the more it affects people 
and business. Computers are in many dif- 
ferent facets of life. When there are few- 
er new cars, houses, banks, manufactur- 
ing plants, research projects, and 
schools, the demand for computers 
declines. 

The results? A lot of computer com- 
panies are riding the whirlwind dream of 
future sales. Many studies predict a 
threefold increase in demand for office 
automation equipment in the next three 
years. Some companies will truly floun- 
der if the economy stays bad and signifi- 
cantly cuts into those dollars of the 
future. 

□ Corporate Bootstraps. Business and 
consumers are in trouble if they invest 
hard-earned money in a computer sys- 
tem that is quickly outdated. Likewise, 
computer manufacturers are in big trou- 
ble if they invest in a technological de- 
velopment that flops or, at best, never 
catches on. 

General Automation (Anaheim, Cali- 
fornia) was the fourth largest manufac- 
turer of minicomputers in the early sev- 
enties. An expensive gamble on an exotic 
technology called silicon-on-sapphire lost 
millions of dollars and sent engineers 
back to the drawing boards. By mid dec- 
ade, things had gone somewhat askew. 

A great deal of money was spent on 



research and development, but no new 
products were forthcoming. The compa- 
ny's response? Several members of the 
executive staff took up religion and tried 
introducing it to employees. 

One day in 1975, a top executive, at- 
tempting to fix a malfunctioning Gener- 
al Automation computer, placed his 
hands on it and prayed. Whether the 
prayer worked or not is a moot point, but 
the doubts raised by this Incident still 
cloud the image of the once high-flying 
minicomputer firm. 

The second half of the seventies saw 
General Automation's stock drop con- 
siderably and many investors abandon 
ship. Keeping up a good service depart- 
ment and customer relations was about 
the only thing the company did right in 
these years. 

General Automation kept publishing 
software, but no new computers saw the 
light of day. A lot of problems can be at- 
tributed to the solid but unproductive 
engineering base of the company. The 
founders had been engineers; research 
projects with uncertain market value 
proliferated. 

When it looked like things could get no 
worse, in September 1979, founder and 
chairman Lawrence Goshom was oust- 
ed by the board of directors. A consul- 
tant was brought in to determine what 
course should have been taken. The con- 
clusion reached was that the company 



was worth saving, but that many thingfs 
had to change ; a turnaround would take 
at least three years. 

A crack senior management staff 
came with the new president. Many de- 
velopment projects were axed and there 
was a sizable work force reduction. The 
decision was made to put out a new fami- 
ly of minicomputers to replace the aging 
16/200 and 16/400 series. Just released, 
Series 900 is General Automation's first 
high-cost performance but cost-effective 
product line in a long time. 

Current plans call for an increased ef- 
fort in software development, as well as a 
microcomputer and a thirty-two bit mini- 
computer due in a year's time. 

General Automation has paid dearly 
for the years of standing still, losing a 
good share of the market. Now they think 
they're on the right road to recovery. It's 
tough playing catchup, but it can be done. 

The second year of a three-year turn- 
around is spent gearing up. The third 
year you go get 'em. 

A General Automation spokesperson 
lamented the economy: "Now It's even 
more of a challenge to get the company 
back on its feet." Regardless, General 
Automation plans to make some signifi- 
cant waves in 1983. Only time will tell 
how they fare. 

□ In Harvard's Way. One of the top 
learning institutions in the country has 
made knowledge of computers manda- 
tory for all undergraduates. Explaining 
the difference between samarium and 
zirconium Is still optional, but under- 
standing simple programming is now 
considered part of getting a good 
education. 

Undergraduates at Harvard Universi- 
ty have to display at the end of their 
freshman year a certain understanding 
of quantitative reasoning. The require- 
ments call for knowledge of data analy- 
sis — probability, means, and standard 
deviations — basic math through Algebra 
II, and basic computer science. 

Adequate knowledge of computers for 
a freshman is defined by the ability to 
write a short program. Ideally, the pro- 
gram should involve a loop, inputting and 
outputtlng data, and a simple function. 
Warren Reed, assistant director of ad- 
missions, calls it a "folksy" test, not 
"particularly onerous." 

"We're not trying to scare students 
away, but we're very serious about mak- 
ing people do it." 

If a student can't pass this require- 
ment at first, they attend minlcourses for 
basic but detailed Instructions on pro- 
gramming. In cases where the mini- 
courses don't do the trick, an introduc- 
tory course in computer science is called 
for. 

"We don't exclude people without 
computer experience, but we keep an eye 
out for some quantitative sense. We're 
encouraging the use of computers as part 
of the academic experience. HI

If you had taken an introductory college course in comput- 
er programming during the sixties or early seventies, the odds 
are the first language you'd have learned would have been 
Fortran. A little later on in the seventies there's a good chance 
you'd have been introduced instead to Fortran's descendent, 
Basic. Nowadays the same class might well offer instruction in 
Pascal instead. 

Basic is still the most popular programming language, by 
far. More people write in Basic than in any other language, and 
this is especially true of microcomputer enthusiasts. Virtually 
every microcomputer on the market offers some form of 
Basic ; in most cases the language is built into the machine in 
ROM. 

Nonetheless, Pascal, which was introduced way back in the 
primordial antemicro days of 1971, has attracted an ever-grow- 
ing following. Its adherents include academics, who like to use 
it as a teaching vehicle, programmers of large-scale business 
applications, and a growing number of ordinary micro hobby- 
ists and end users as well. 

A couple of major factors account for Pascal's appeal. 
First, because of the way the language is usually imple- 
mented, programs in Pascal tend to be more easily transfer- 
able from one kind of computer to another. 

It's Got Steps Appeal. On most computers, including the 
Apple, Pascal is both a compiled language and an interpreted 
one. In the customary scheme of things, a program written in 
Pascal gets compiled into a sort of low-level language called 
p-code, or pseudo-code. Then, when the program is run, the host 
computer converts the p-code into native machine language, 
line by line, just as the Basic interpreter does for a Basic pro- 
gram. 

The advantage of this two-step process is that it permits a 
high degree of standardization of the front end, the part of the 
system where you write, edit, and debug your programs. 

For example, when you write a Pascal program on the Ap- 
ple, you use a facility called an editor. The editor works much 
like a word processor. Just as you would create a document on 
a word processor and subsequently edit, rearrange, or other- 
wise massage it, so can you use the Pascal editor as a develop- 
ment tool for your programming efforts. The editor offers such 
facilities as automatic indenting — useful for enhancing the 
visual clarity of your code — and automatic search and replace 
functions. 

When you finish writing a program in the editor, or when 
you're ready to take a break from it, you summon another part 
of the system, called the filer, which does some of the same 
functions in Pascal that DOS performs for the Applesoft pro- 
grammer. The filer is a utility program for managing your 
disk files. 



Later, when you're ready to run your program, you send 
the text, or source file, off to the compiler, which converts your 
Pascalian words of wisdom into p-code and reports back to you 
on any syntax errors it may have found. The compiler and the 
editor are in close touch with each other, so that if the com- 
piler does find anything objectionable, it tells the editor where 
the problem is, and the editor (usually) takes you straight to 
the offending word in your source code. 

It's Shy, But It Has Sass. Part of what's nifty about all this is 
that these front-end features — the editor, the filer, the com- 
piler, and some others — are virtually identical on other Pascal 
systems. The part of a Pascal implementation that varies from 
one computer to another is not the part the programmer sees 
and works with, but the translation of p-code into native ma- 
chine language. So a program written in Pascal can be 
transported relatively easily from one computer to another, 
and a publisher of commercial software can make programs 
available on a variety of machines without heavy reinvest- 
ment of development time. 

Ease of portability is not one of Basic's stronger features. 
That's because Basic grew somewhat in the manner of a 
natural language; various groups, using the language on dif- 
ferent machines, added new features to the original body of the 
language, so that eventually there came to be a lot of related 
dialects, all called Basic, rather than a single standardized tongue. 

A second major reason for Pascal's success is that pro- 
grammers who use it believe the nature of the language itself 
encourages them to write programs that are better organized 
and easier to maintain. 

Pascal, like Basic, is a general-purpose language, as op- 
posed to a specialized one for particular kinds of applications, 
such as education or engineering. The two languages have 
similar vocabulary and use comparable command words 
{ivrite in Pascal, for example, does essentially the same thing 
as print in Basic). 

The biggest syntactic difference between Pascal and Basic 
has to do with the way instructions are organized. Pascal is an 
example of what's sometimes called a structured language; it 
might be more correct to say that it's a language that encour- 
ages structured programming. Let's compare a short pro- 
gram skeleton formatted both ways. 

Here's a miniscule example of what might be part of a 
Basic program:

The computer would begin executing this fragment at line 
300. It would execute statements 1 through 3, then, arriving at 
line 330, it would evaluate two variables, X and Y, which, pre- 
sumably, would have been defined elsewhere in the program. 
If it found X to be less than Y, it would return to line 300 and 
perform these same sequence of events again ; if not, it could 
continue to line 340. This is one way of achieving a loop in 
Basic. 

It Loops to the Future. A Pascal program might do the 
same business in a manner something like this: 



REPEAT 

STATEMENT 1; 

STATEMENT 2; 

STATEMENT 3; 
UNTIL X >=Y; 
STATEMENT 4; 



The result would be the same in both languages, but the 
constructs have different appearances. In Pascal the whole se- 
quence from repeat to until X> = Y\ is handled as a single unit, 
a compound statement built of several simple statements. 

Suppose now that we make entrance into the loop condi- 
tional upon some other event. Let's say, for example, that if P 
should be equal to Q we'd like to execute the sequence of state- 
ments in lines 300 to 330 and if that's not the case, if P isn't 
equal to Q, we'll forget the whole thing and go on to line 340. We 
could accomplish that in Basic by adding a line 290, as follows 
(the < > symbol means "is not equal to") : 

290 IF P <> Q THEN GOTO 340 

If we wanted to the do the same thing in Pascal, that is, if 
we wanted to make execution of the loop conditional upon the 
equality of P and Q, we would build a larger compound state- 
ment to enclose the compound statement we'd already made, 
the result would look like this: 



IF P = Q 
THEN REPEAT 

STATEMENT 1; 

STATEMENT 2; 

STATEMENT 3; 
UNTIL X >=Y 
ELSE STATEMENT 4; 



Most programs of any size and complexity have a lot of 
branch points — places where the program will vary its be- 
havior according to the presence or absence of some condi- 
tion. It's not at all uncommon to find branching structures 
nested within other branching structures. 

It's Cozy with Logic. Basic handles this kind of complexity 
by spinning out a switching network of goto statements. Pas- 
cal does it by building more comprehensive logical units. The 
result of Pascal's approach is sometimes called block struc- 
ture, and block structure is one element of what people mean 
when they speak of structured programming. 

Pascal's block-structured approach is at once liberating 
and constraining. It's constraining because it requires you to 
know pretty well where you're going before you begin to write 
code. In Basic it's easier than it is in Pascal to dive right in and 
begin programming and then alter or refine your code on the 

fly- 
But the people who prefer Pascal say the constraint of hav- 
ing to have a program mapped out before they begin to write is 
an advantage, not an disadvantage. It encourages, if not 
forces, them to develop good organizational habits and there- 
fore to produce more efficient programs. It urges them, among 
other things, to adopt a top-down approach to problem solving, 
one that starts with large objectives and refines them into suc- 
cessively smaller subobjectives. 



JUNE 1982

A liberating consequence of Pascal's block structure is that 
a Pascal program is easier to read than one in Basic. The way 
the code is laid out on paper (or in the editor) clearly reflects 
the logical organization of the program. 

It might not be fair to say that Basic encourages careless 
programming habits, although it does not do the things that 
Pascal does to encourage organizational discipline; but it's 
generally fair to say that Basic programs are hard to read. 
Even your own program may be tough to figure out a week or 
so after you've written it. 

A Basic program is a little like one of those pictures you 
draw by connecting numbered dots. Once you sit down with it 
and trace the connections, the gestalt does begin to emerge. 
But the organization is not usually apparent at a casual glance. 

The readability of a program becomes a significant factor 
if the program is large and complex, like a database manager 
or a word processor. It's an especially crucial factor if more 
than one person is working on developing the program or if the 
program is likely to require modification at some later time. 

It Can Take Action. Pascal programs are always divided 
into two main sections : a declaration area and the main body 
of program instructions. Actually all programs, in all lan- 
guages, consist of two kinds of statements: those that tell the 
computer to take some overt action and those that provide in- 
formation that will be used by the computer when it takes ac- 
tion. Pascal separates these two kinds of statements, putting 
all of the nonexecutable, informing kind into the declaration 
area and reserving all the action statements for the main body 
of the program. 

Among other things, the declaration area must include a 
list of all variables to be used in the program, as well as their 
types. Variables are names used to designate data available to 
the program; P, Q, X, and Y in our examples a few para- 
graphs ago are variables. As the term variable suggests, the 
values held under these names may change during the course 
of a program run. 

The variable type indicates what kind of data is held under 
a variable name. The programmer needs to specify, for ex- 
ample, whether a given variable is to be used for numeric in- 
formation or information that may include letters as well as 
numbers. If a variable's data is to be strictly numeric, it may 
be typed as either integer or real; the former category is less 
consumptive of memory resources but can only be used for 
whole numbers within a certain range. 

Pascal permits programmers to designate nonstandard 
data types. So a certain variable could be declared to be of type 
DayoftheWeek, for example, and the compiler could be in- 
formed that the DayoftheWeek type has only seven legal 
values: 'Mon,' 'Tues,' 'Wed,' and so on. The advantage to this 
approach is that it establishes automatic error-checking pro- 
cedures. The programmer doesn't have to write separate code 
within the program to keep a user from entering unusable 
data. 

Also within the declaration area, the programmer may de- 
fine procedures and functions. 

A procedure is a segment of code that the programmer 
wants to identify by name. The instructions subsumed by the 
procedure would be spelled out in the declaration area but not 
executed there. In the main body of the program, the compiler 
would then encounter the procedure name and execute the in- 
structions specified in the declaration area. 

Usually, but not necessarily, procedures are used for re- 
current routines within a program. So a person writing a 
blackjack program might, for example, want to declare a pro- 
cedure called shuffle, another called deal, and a third called 
takemoney. 

It Has a Streamlined Body. The provision for named pro- 
cedure serves several useful functions. It streamlines the ap- 
pearances of the main body of the program, so that a person 
trying to understand what the program does has fewer logical 
elements to look at. Second, it makes the main body of the pro- 
gram appear more like English; a well- written program that 
uses a lot of procedures may consist almost entirely of English 



or near- English words. And third, it makes it easier for a pro- 
grammer to create on disk a library of routines that may be 
summoned for duty in various programs. 

A function is similar to a procedure, except that it's used 
within some kind of arithmetic or other expression. For exam- 
ple, one could define a function called hypotenuse as the square 
root of the summed squares of two other bits of data. The other 
bits of data, within the context of this function, would be called 
parameters ; their values would have to be supplied whenever 
the hypotenuse function was used. 

Functions and procedures are not unique to Pascal. The def 
fn statement in Basic also allows you to define your own func- 
tions, and the Basic subroutine has the same effect on the out- 
come of a program as does the Pascal procedure. 

What's distinctive about Pascal is that functions and proce- 
dures can be given recognizable names and that they must be 
declared in a separate section of the program. 

Should you learn Pascal? The answer may depend on your 
style and your programming goals. If you mostly want to write 
short programs and want to be able to do them quickly, you'll 
probably find Pascal a real pain in the neck. On the other hand, 
if you want to do more complex things or you're interested in 
developing commercial software to run on other computers as 
well as on the Apple, you might want to consider Pascal. 

It Likes Expansive Tools. If you decide to get into Pascal, 
you'll need to get two things for your Apple : a 16K RAM card to 
put in slot 0 and the Pascal language and operating system. 
That's assuming you already have 48K on your motherboard; 
if you don't, you'll need to bring your system up to 48K as well. 

There are a variety of ways to get this equipment. Apple 
sells the whole package, hardware and software, as its Lan- 
guage System. You get a RAM card and four disks with the 
quaint names of AppleO:, Applel:, Apple2:, and Apple3:. Or 
you can buy the hardware and the software separately. 

There are also a number of other companies that make 
functionally equivalent RAM cards and still others that make

Pascal software. 

The reason you need all this gear is that you're buying not 
just a langTjage but a whole operating system — a program- 
ming environment, as they say. The RAM card shares the 
memory space from 49152 to 65535 with the six ROMs on your 
motherboard. A process called bank switching allows the 6502 
to decide which set of chips — the ROMs or the chips on your 
RAM board — it wants to acknowledge as being within its 
memory domain. When you boot the appropriate member of 
your Pascal software set, the 6502 bids a temporary goodnight 
to your motherboard ROMs and loads an item called Sys- 
tem.Apple into the RAM board. 

It Keeps Secrets. Because the Pascal operating system in- 
cludes its won input/output system, it overrides DOS as well as 
the Basic Interpreter and the System Monitor. Unfortunately, 
the filer's methods of storing data on disk are different from 
those of DOS, so the files you create through Pascal will not be 
accessible to programs you may write in Basic. There are, 
however, utilities available that will convert files from one op- 
erating system to the other. 

There are several side benefits to having that RAM card in 
slot 0. The first is that you get the equivalent of having the al- 
ternate dialect of Basic — Integer on an Apple II Plus or Apple- 
soft on a standard Apple II — in ROM. When you boot your DOS 
System Master disk, the Hello program goes out looking to see 
if you have a RAM card in slot 0. If it finds one, it loads the card 
with a software version of whichever Basic interpreter you 
don't have in firmware. Once the alternate language is there, 
you can switch back and forth from one Basic to the other by 
typing int for Integer and/p for Applesoft. 

The second side benefit is that certain commercial pro- 
grams that don't use either Basic interpreter are able to take 
advantage of the extra memory space provided by the card. 
VisiCalc is one notable example. On a 48K Apple without a 
RAM card, VisiCalc offers you 18K of memory in which to de- 
velop your spreadsheet. With a RAM card you get 34K. 

Still another incidental benefit of having the card is that it 



makes it possible for you to use certain other languages on 
your Apple, such as Fortran, Pilot, or Logo. Each of these, like 
Pascal, has its own software component that you must buy 
separately, but you need the RAM card as well. 

It Has an Exotic Past. Pascal was published first in 1971, by 
Niklaus Wirth of the eidgenosslsche technlsche Hochschule In 
Zurich. Wirth was primarily interested in creating a lan- 
guage, not an entire operating system. He wanted, among 
other things, to improve a language called Algol and to create 
a vehicle for teaching programming. 

The operating system that was to become standard for Pas- 
cal users was developed some time later by a group at the Uni- 
versity of California, San Diego, under the leadership of Ken- 
neth Bowles. The system came to be known as UCSD Pascal. 

It also became a huge commercial success — so much so 
that the university found it necessary to divest itself of the 
property. It sold the rights to the UCSD system to Softech, a 
large producer of mainframe system software, which spawned 
a subsidiary, Softech Microsystems, to handle and develop the 
UCSD system. The name UCSD remained with the product, 
though Bowles and some other key people originally associ- 
ated with it at the university went separate ways. 

UCSD systems were produced for a variety of different 
computers, including the Apple. In the meantime, however, 
before the divestiture, Apple Computer had negotiated an 
agreement that had allowed them to market the system under 
their own name. The end result is that there are two nearly 
identical Pascal systems available to you as an Apple user.

that the material, as if of its own volition, presses toward ever-

lit • er • ate (adj.) 1. Able to read and write. 2. Knowl- 
edgeable; educated. S. Familiar with literature, liter- 
ary. — n. 1. Someone who can read and write. 2. A well-in- 
formed, educated person. 

Ask most literate people to define the word literate and they 
will probably come somewhere close to the dictionary defini- 
tion. Put the word computer in front of it, and people's clarity, 
certainty, and unanimity about what this modified term means 
is likely to diminish dramatically. 

But even people who aren't sure what computer literacy 
consists of are becoming convinced of its importance. In fact, 
more and more educators, parents, and students see comput- 
er literacy includes computer awareness and also means some 
nology that has begtin to revolutionize the work world, the 
home, and the educational process. And they are looking to the 
schools and to various other public and private sources to pro- 
vide instruction that will help them achieve computer lit- 
eracy. 

Numerous camps, seminars, classes, workshops, founda- 
tions, institutes, clubs, books, pamphlets, and software pro- 
grams have come into existence in response to the perceived 
need for computer literacy. And it won't be long now before 
coin-operated microcomputers in libraries, in community cen- 
ters, and in pizza parlors become the norm rather than the 
town curiosity. 

At a time when so much is happening, the need for a clear 
idea of what computer literacy is becomes more apparent. A 
definition might serve as a sort of road map through this in- 
creasingly populated territory, and help individuals to be more 
focused in their pursuit of computer literacy. After all, as the 
not-so-old saying goes, "If you don't know where you're going, 
it doesn't much matter where you start from." 

Dueling Dictionaries. The definition of what it means to be 
computer literate seems to have changed somewhat over the 
years, or maybe it just depends on who's doing the defining. 
Some would say that being computer literate basically means 
having a general understanding of various aspects of informa- 
tion processing technology, an awareness of how computers af- 
fect society, and a knowledge of how computers can be used to 
solve problems. 

So far, so good. But as technology moves ever faster and its 
effects become more powerful and far-reaching, a case can 
certainly be made for the view that more is needed if one is to 
call oneself computer literate. In an effort to take this into ac- 
count, some people (some of the time) make a distinction be- 
tween computer literacy and a less sophisticated state known 
as "computer awareness." The "Apple Educator's Informa- 
tion Booklet" from Apple Computer offers concise definitions 
of both terms, delineating the difference between them in the 
process: 

"Computer awareness usually means becoming aware of 
the extent to which computers are a part of our lives. Comput- 
er literacy includes computer awareness and also means some 
ability to program or control the computer. Computer literacy 
can only be achieved by hands-on experience and practice." 

Wise Fingers Do the Walking. Dr. Arthur Leuhrmann, an 
authority on computer literacy and cofounder of Computer Lit- 
eracy, Inc., wholeheartedly agrees that hands-on experience is 
essential. When asked for a definition of computer literacy, he 
makes the connection between this kind of literacy and the 
other literacies. People who are literate, says Leuhrmann— in 



math, in language skills — are "in control, in charge." Because 
they can read and write, they can do things for themselves, 
"work things out for themselves," without relying on others to 
tell them what's going on. People who are literate can commu- 
nicate their own ideas and can read and comprehend the ideas 
of others. 

Then, bringing the whole issue of definition down to an even 
more basic, no-nonsense level, Leuhrmann asserts, "If you can 
tell a computer to do what you want it to, you are computer lit- 
erate. If you can't, you're not." 

Although he feels that the perspective gained by knowing 
about the history of computers is a valuable one, he strongly 
believes that the primary focus in computer literacy instruc- 
tion needs to be on improving people's abilities to express their 
ideas and to understand and make use of other people's. He 
points out that the schools have been the place in our society 
where literacy training has gone on in other areas and be- 
lieves that they are also the best place for computer literacy 
training to occur. 

In Leuhrmann's view, junior high is the ideal time for kids 
to be offered a "serious course" in computer literacy. At this 
age, they are developmentally capable of conceptualizing — 
they have the ability to create a picture in their minds of what 
memory is, what input is, what output is. 

What would students in Leuhrmann's "serious course" be 
doing? Well, it helps to backtrack a little and say what they 
would not be doing. What they would not be doing is spending 
all their time sitting in front of the computer learning tradi- 
tional basic skills. Leuhrmann does not mean to diminish the 
importance of kids learning the basic skills. Far from it. He 
stresses especially the importance of basic math skills, math 
reasoning, and estimation skills; without them, you are just 
"taking the word" of the calculator — you are not in control at 
all. 

Rather, what Leuhrmann objects to is the prospect of stu- 
dents becoming slaves to the computer for everyday lessons 
and drill, rather than learning how to tell the computer to do 
what they want it to. 

In a serious computer literacy course, students would meet 
every day, but would spend only every other day in front of the 
computer, experimenting and doing projects. In between, they 
would work with a teacher, whose role would be to provide a 
frame of reference for the ideas they were learning. Students 
in such a course would learn a programming language, al- 
though it doesn't especially matter to Leuhrmann which one. 
There are much larger issues to be concerned about, he be- 
lieves, than promoting the use of one language over another. 

One thing that disturbs Leuhrmann at times is the empha- 
sis in teaching on the grammar of a programming language — 
the propemess of a statement— with the result being that there 
is insufficient stress on the thinking processes involved. Learn- 
ing programming helps students learn a way to write, a way to 
think — a way to organize their ideas and to decide how to solve 
a problem in a logical, step-by-step fashion — and, in many sit- 
uations, this aspect of programming is not stressed sufficiently. 

Programming Your Personal Best. Precollege Computer

sity of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403) for a single-copy price of 
$1.50. You're likely to find this concise, literate booklet a most 
valuable resource/reference if you are interested in attaining a 
perspective on computer literacy and in clarifying your own 
ideas on what it is and how it can be achieved. 

Rather than attempting to specify course goals and objec- 
tives, the author approaches computer literacy "based upon 
the idea that a computer can have a personal impact upon the 
student, and that the student will be self-motivated to acquire a 
certain level of computer literacy because of the personal 
value of computers." Moursund stresses the importance of 
functional knowledge, and feels that students need easy, ev- 
eryday access to computers if they are to become computer lit- 
erate. 

Moursund has views similar to Leuhrmann's about the con- 
nection between programming and problem solving and about 
the place of programming skills in the definition and develop- 
ment of computer literacy. He suggests that the definition of 
programming be expanded to include the use of "information 
retrieval, word processing, statistics, and other applications 
systems." 

He also makes the important points that the definition of 
computer literacy must vary depending upon the age and 
other characteristics of the person involved (just as does the 
definition of traditional literacy). He maintains that the re- 
quirements for literacy will change over time as the capabili- 
ties of the available hardware and software change and as the 
technological advancements we achieve are applied to vari- 
ous fields. It would seem that when it comes to computer liter- 
acy, whoever coined the phrase lifelong learning was right on 
target, because, in fact, progress and change create new 
knowledge to be learned, new skills to be mastered. 

Vanishing Tunnel Vision. If we are parents, our more im- 
mediate concerns about computer literacy education — our own 
and our children's — sometimes lead us to overlook some very 



significant aspects of the overall picture. We may be so fo- 
cused in on our present efforts to meet the demands of the fu- 
ture that we don't recognize the implications that this present 
may have for the rapidly approaching future. 

One vital piece of the computer literacy puzzle must be put 
into place — who is teaching the teachers? How are teachers 
keeping up with the pace of technology, and with the pace at 
which our microkids (as a recent Time cover story dubbed 
them) are learning? 

The Apple Education Foundation has named teacher train- 
ing as one of the areas to which it will give the highest priority 
and interest when it comes to grant support. Already funded by 
the foundation is a teacher training project at Iowa State Uni- 
versity. 

Other organizations and individuals share this awareness of 
the importance of teacher training. The Microcomputers in 
Education program, jointly sponsored by the School of Educa- 
tion at Stanford University and Interactive Sciences, a non- 
profit corporation, has an especially creative way of address- 
ing this concern. 

As Jeff Levlnsky, a member of the workshop faculty and 
vice-president of Interactive Sciences, describes it, tWs in- 
depth workshop is designed for teachers, many of whom don't 
have much computer background, who want to establish and 
operate microcomputer learning centers in their districts. 
Teachers who participate in the six-week in-depth workshop 
come away with experience, knowledge, and a feeling of com- 
fortableness with technology that will help them operate such a 
center when they return home. In addition, they're likely to be- 
come computer resource people for their districts. 

Course work in the first three weeks emphasizes computer 
literacy, Basic programming, and learning and practicing the 
peer tutoring techniques that will be so essential to the estab- 
lishment of a learning center. Included in the second three- 
week session are such advanced techniques and topics as

One of the first things to which educators become exposed 
when they start the program is peer tutoring methods. Almost 
from the outset, they are given plenty of opportunity to try out 
their new skills — they teach what they have learned to junior 
high-level kids who are attending a five-week computer sum- 
mer camp known as Computer Tutors at Stanford. Mean- 
while, the teachers — the ones who are learning peer tutoring — 
are also being tutored. 

The teachers' tutors are young people who have been espe- 
cially selected for their jobs — ^they are chosen from among the 
students who have completed the Computer Tutors course pro- 
gram. According to Levinsky, besides having completed six to 
ten weeks of initial training, the young people chosen to tutor 
the teachers have experience tutoring other students and have 
had a certain amount of advanced training as well. 

The scheduling and coordination of a program such as this 
one could well be a nightmare, but the enthusiasm of the peo- 
ple involved suggests that it's all worth it. Sound premises 
seem to underlie it; namely, that people learn by teaching and 
teach by learning, and that human resources are our most val- 
uable ones. 

Be the First on Your Block. Not all computer literacy ef- 
forts are directed at educators or at students in a school set- 
ting. Welcome to ComputerTown, USA! This nationwide expe- 
rience involving people of all ages had its beginnings in Menlo 
Park, California, in 1979 and has since taken root in Illinois, 
Texas, Wisconsin, and Washington, D.C., and in Germany and 
the United Kingdom, as well as in other California towns. 

ComputerTown, USA! is actually the name of the nation- 
wide dissemination project funded by the National Science 
Foundation, and its job is to help new, local ComputerTowns 
get started by providing them with information that will sup- 
port and guide them in their progress. A formal implementa- 
tion package containing information on how to start and man- 
age a successful ComputerTown is also planned but is not yet 
available. 

As the story goes, the first ComputerTown came to be when 
Ramon Zamora and Bob Albrecht, coauthors of numerous self- 
teaching books about computers, began taking their own com- 
puters with them to public places like bookstores, pizza par- 
lors, and parks to give people who were interested in comput- 
ers a chance to use them. So many people expressed interest 
that the two men approached the city librarian and arranged 
to have weekly computer sessions in the library's community 
room. This provided a safe place for the computers to reside on 
a permanent basis. 

It was a three-year National Science Foundation grant 
awarded to Zamora and Albrecht in September of 1980 that al- 
lowed them to get ComputerTown going on a larger scale. 
Since then, classes, workshops, and other events in the com- 
munity have gotten thousands of people involved with using 
computers. 

According to FVitzi Lareau of the People's Computer Com- 
pany, a nonprofit educational foundation involved in Menlo 
Park's ComputerTown, the basic purpose of ComputerTowns 
across the country is the same as that of the original imple- 
mentation. ComputerTowns attempt to help people become 
more comfortable with computers, to help them feel friendly 
toward computers rather than afraid of them, and to help them 
move toward integrating and accepting microcomputer tech- 
nology into their lives in the same way they have accepted and 
feel at home with telephones. 

The original ComputerTown USA! in Menlo Park serves as 
one model of what a ComputerTown can be, but each time a 
group of individuals comes together to start a ComputerTown, 
the results are different. What takes shape depends, of course, 
on a variety of factors, including the level of interest and ex- 
pertise of the people who participate, the level of funding avail- 
able, and the level of involvement of local corporations and 
businesses.

to have in common is the desire on the part of participants to 
become more aware and literate about computers and tech- 
nology and an emphasis on informal learning settings in which 
people share their knowledge, their expertise, and their ques- 
tions and inexperience with one another. 

Looking Ahead — Progress Has Consequences. In his arti- 
cle, "Computer Literacy," which appears in the March 1982 is- 
sue of The Computing Teacher, Arthur Leuhrmann points 
some possible consequences of today's computer literacy ef- 
forts at the junior high and high school levels. 

One basic issue seems to be this — the more successful we 
are at getting microcomputers in our junior and senior high 
schools (if the number of computers in secondary schools con- 
tinues to increase at the current annual rate, there will be ap- 
proximately one computer for every sixteen students) , and the 
more successful we are in creating environments in which chil- 
dren can gain literacy skills, the greater the need becomes for 
us to anticipate and set in motion the necessary next steps at 
the college level. Students who have gotten hands-on expe- 
rience at the precollege level will not (and should not) be con- 
tent with less adequate facilities and instruction at the college 
level. 

According to Leuhrmann, such inadequacy is likely to take 
one or all of three forms : poor access to computing, over- , 
crowded computer science courses, and unprepared general 
faculty. Dealing with the new problems our advancement . 
creates, including the vast gap between those who have had 
and taken advantage of computer literacy opportunities and 
those who have not — will be among the major challenges of the 
coming years. 

Conference Comer. The School of Education at the Univer- • 
sity of Oregon will hold its third annual summer conference 
July 21 through 23 at the Eugene Hilton Hotel. The conference, 
entitled "The Computer: Extension of the Human Mind," will 
explore and share current developments and future trends in 
computer-assisted teaching and learning. The three-day con- 



ference is expected to draw teachers, parents, and students. 

Dr. David G. Moursund, a computer and information sci- 
ence professor at the university and president of the ICCE, will 
give the opening address. Appropriately, his topic is "The 
Computer Literate Student." Other scheduled conference 
speakers include representatives of various educational insti- 
tutions and of the business community who are recognized for 
their knowledge of the computer field. Their presentations will 
explore such topics as preparing teachers to teach with com- 
puters and the ethical and social issues associated with com- 
puter use. Small group sessions will cover using computers in 
home instruction, in lab science courses, and as career coun- 
seling tools. There will also be a workshop on using computers 
with gifted students, and one on using computers in the early 
grades. 

There will be an exhibit area in which a variety of comput- 
ers can be seen and used by participants, a demonstration 
room, and an on-site theater for computer films. 

Enrollment is limited, so preregistration is suggested. Ad- 
ditional information about the conference or about how to reg- 
ister can be obtained by contacting Jude Ridge, College of Ed- 
ucation, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403; (503) 686- 
3405. 

Legislation Pending. The Technology Education Act of 
1982, otherwise known as H.R. 5573, could have a powerful im- 
pact on computer literacy in the United States. This is the bill 
that would make it financially feasible for Apple Computer and 
other manufacturers to donate microcomputers to elemen- 
tary and secondary schools. H.R. 5573 had its hearings in the 
Senate Finance Committee on May 7th. As of that date, the bill 
had sixty-seven cosponsors and had the support of both Re- 
publicans and Democrats. Next stop is hearings in the House of 
Representatives. Some decision will have to be made before 
Congress adjourns in the fall or the bill will die. 



Company capsules will resume next month. 



—Prepare them for their future 

In a society bound together by information, computers are as fundamental to a child's education as reading and writing. 
In this age of such rapid change, learning itself is an essential skill. Today's children will be adults in a complex, 
computerized society. 

Young children can take to the computer as effortlessly as they learn to speak. Why not use this time to its fullest 
advantage? 

The microcomputer is the ideal learning companion. Its patience is infinite, and its feedback is immediate. Well-designed 
software systems from Edu-Ware create comfortable interaction between children and the computer, making learning easy. 




SPELLING BEE™ with READING PRIMER™

The readers' choice for first place in Softalk's Art Gallery: Chuck Arnold's Lost Horizon won for hand-drown art 
and Ben Lantermon's Specter for computer-drawn work. 



from Softalk for winning the computer 
graphics portion of Art Gallery; $150 
worth of any software advertised in Sof- 
talk from Penguin, and his second-place 
prize for the animation portion of Pen- 
guin's contest, a copy of Penguin's 
Graphics Magician. He figures he'll put 
the money toward a new VisiCalc — which 
he can use as a flight engineer. What we 
have here could be another da Vinci, for 
Leonardo was designing flight machines 
as well as his art work back during the 
Renaissance. 

More Art Gallery Winners. Lanter- 
man didn't walk away with all the prizes. 
Softalk' a readers voted for Chuck Arnold 
(Dalton, GA) as first place winner in the 
hand-drawn category for Lost Horizon, a 
modernistic eye in an Apple. Arnold will 
also be awarded $100 worth of software at 
his local computer store, Ck)mpu-shop. 
He'll probably apply it toward the pur- 
chase of Hi-Res Football, Hi-Res Com- 
puter Golf, and Pool 1.5. The runners-up 
in both categories will receive $10 
credits: Eddie Moore (Mesquite, TX), 
for Master Blaster; Jeff Coyle (Ana- 
heim, CA), Rat Race; Nathan Jensen 
(Austin, TX), War; Mary Ciccolella (Pis- 
cataway, N J) , Pharaohs and The Wind ; 
Bob Martin (Boulder, CO), Infamy; 
Wendel Kirkbride (Idaho Falls, ID), 
Climber II; Mildred Edwards (Water- 
loo, lA), Conquest of the Cosmos; Brian 
Taylor (Pasadena, CA) , Dragon Slayer; 
and Ben Lanterman (haven't you heard 
that name somewhere before?) for his 
Stalker. 

There was one more part to that con- 
test: Softalk's readers, who were asked 
to judge the contest, had their ballots 
numbered and our random number gen- 
erator chose Lonny Zwickle of Hooper, 
Nevada. For helping Softalk judge this 
tough contest, Zwickle receives a $100 
credit at his local computer store. 

Guest Contest: The Penguin Com- 
puter Art Competition. Mark Pelczarski 
of Penguin Software also had the oppor- 
tunity for a little bit of art appreciation 
with his guest contest, which ran in the 
January issue of Softalk. The contest had 



tiiree parts: for best computer picture, 
best computer animation-moving pic- 
ture, and for best computer calligraphy- 
character generated font. F'irst prize in 
each category is $150 toward the pur- 
chase of any software advertised in Sof- 
talk ; second prize winners receive copies 
of Pengfuin's Graphics Magician; third 
place prizes are copies of Penguin's Spe- 
cial Effects. 

Softalk readers were able to enter the 
competition using any graphics pro- 
gram on the market. Pelczarski judged 
on originality and execution. 

And now for the envelope please, Mr. 
Pelczarski: 

Computer Art: first place, Way Out, 
Ben Lanterman (Bridgeton, MO) ; sec- 
ond place. Sea, Elizabeth Riggle (Louis- 
ville, KY) ; and third place, Edge, Chuck 
Bilow and Bob Casey (Electronic Easel, 
Madison, WI). 

Animation: first place, Choo Choo, 
Margaret Park (Pullman, WA) ; second 
place. The Present, Lanterman; and 
third place: Cristoforo Columbo, Bilow 
and Casey. 

Fonts: first place. Laughs, Riggle; 
second place, Creepy, Doug Smith (Oak 
Park, IL) ; and third place, Elvish, 
Wayne Mascarella (Chapel Hill, NC) . 

Guest Contest: The Great Trick Shot 
Tournament. Trick Shot was a long shot, 
but Don Hoffman of Innovative Design 
Software came up with three winners in 
IDSI's guest contest from last January, 
The Great Trick Shot Tournament. The 
object of the contest was to find the con- 
summate shot — the most artistic, the 
most imaginative, the most innovative, 
and the most difficult pool shot that could 
be conceived. The stakes were iiigh: first 
prize was $1,000 followed by prizes of $500 
and $250 for runners-up. 

Pool shark Stanley C. Stockdale 
(Daley City, CA) won first prize ; Harold 
P. Zimmerman (Fairloom, OH) took sec- 
ond place; and Daniel A. Hammond (El 
Paso, TX) came away with third place. 

You play hard and you win hard in 
ttiis game. Pool 1.5 and Trick Sfwt may 
be better than the real thing. 3M

Softalk Presents Hie Bestsellers 



Dan Bricklin and Robert Frankston have forsaken the lofty 
heights. The authors of VisiCalc have been in the enviable po- 
sition of watching while the competition tried to catch up with 
their innovative speadsheet program. 

Now they've announced software that will compete with 
MatheMagic (MatheWho?) in the contest to turn your com- 
puter into the most sophisticated calculator possible. For the 
first time, the pair will demonstrate whether the genius that is 
VisiCalc is transportable to other software. 

But that program won't be out until late this year — as soft- 
ware schedules usually go, that probably means sometime 
next year. Until then, Bricklin and Frankston remain the un- 
challenged champs of microcomputerdom. VisiCalc for the 
Apple II continues nearly to double the sales of its closest com- 
petitor. VisiCalc for the Apple III took a clear-cut lead over ^dp- 
ple Writer III in sales of Apple III software. And indications 
are that the program is equally as dominant in other personal 
computer markets. 

The rest of the top ten bestsellers received a shakeup in 



sales in the month of April. Home Accountant took over sec- 
ond place, Snack Attack moved up to third. Wizardry rose to 
fourth and Personal Filing System dropped from second to 
fifth. 

Apple Writer II, the Paul Lutus upgrade to the old stan- 
dard, jumped from nowhere to sixth; DB Master rose to sev-

ten or fifteen units of a title as being their top seller were re- 
porting sales nearing fifty for the sequel to the popular Wiz- 
ardry. 

In Apple III software sales, VisiCalc III took over the lead, 
deposing Apple Writer III. The only new program on the list is 
Word Juggler from Quark, which jumped into sixth place. 

Sales of both Apple Writer III and Mail List Manager from 
Apple are being depressed by a lack of communication within 
the company. Apple brought out a 256K Apple III, but Apple 
Writer III is incapable of recognizing the additional 128K of 
memory. Likewise, Apple has been successfully moving Pro- 
File hard disks; but, alas, Mail List Manager looks at the de- 
vice as simply another single-density floppy. 

It can be anticipated that sales of both products will rise 
when Apple remedies these deficiencies.

a time looked like it would take a virtual monopoly position in 
the Apple market now awaits release as ScreenWriter II, but 
it'll have a long hard pull to regain its once dominant position. 

Apple Writer II is a significant enhancement of Apple's be- 
ginners' word processing program. WordStar continues to 
make inroads among Apple's forty thousand CP/M users. The 
enhanced eighty-column version of Super-Text is making a 
strong run. Word Handler and Executive Secretary are con- 
tinuing to gain strength, with Word Handler, a program simi- 
lar in concept to Superscribe, gaining the charts. In all, the 
task facing ScreenWriter is formidable. 

Apple Speller from Sensible Software is leagues ahead of 
the other word processing proof reading programs. These pro- 
grams will be combined with word processors in an expanded 
listing next month. 

The Business 10 stayed exactly the same through the first 
seven positions in April. The biggest change was the appear- 
ance on the list of the powerful but expensive DBase II pro- 
gram from Ashton-Tate. As with WordStar, DBase II is capi-

talizing on the large CP/M user base within the Apple market. 

Home Accountant continues to lead all other Home 10 prod- 
ucts by a three-to-one margin. Interesting, however, is the 
charge of MasterType into second place. Bruce Zweig's pro- 
gram is proving that software with an educational purpose can 
be both fun and profitable. 

Biggest revision to the Home 10 sees the demise of the tax 
packages. Tax Manager and Tax Beater dropped off the list, 
while Tax Preparer slumped to eighth. Among the products

taking up the slack was the information utility, The Source, 
which was the sixth largest seller in this category. Data Cap- 
ture A.O has now taken a commanding lead over its communi- 
cations counterparts. 

The Hobby 10 list reflects the sophistication with which soft- 
ware publishers are now approaching the utility market. Zoom 
Grafuv. the universal graphics dump, took over first place. Bag 
of Tticks, a compendium of four progp'ams, any one of which is 
probably worth the price of the entire disk, grabbed second. 
Utility City continued to fare well in the market and Randy 
Hyde's revamped LISA assembler has surged to fifth. 

Outside of Wizardry and Castle Wofenstein, the specialty 
entertainment software sales have not kept pace with the 
growth of the market. For example, On-Line Systems once 
could be counted on to provide two or more hi-res adventures 
for the Top Thirty. Now Kabul Spy from Sirius leads that gen- 
re and sits in the lower echelon of the Top Thirty. 

Not only did Kabul Spy depose On-Line from the top of the 
hi-res adventure list, but Deadline, the no-res text mystery 
from Infocom, grabbed off second. Time Zone, On-Line's epic, 
was third. 

Trailing Castle Wolfenstein in the Strategy 5 list were all old 
favorites: Flight Simulator, Sargon, Robot War, and Warp 
Factor. 

There was nothing much new in April in the Fantasy 5 list, 
although Ultima hesied Apventure to Atlantis for second place. 
The May sales, which will chart Knight of Diamonds, will 
bring more substantial revisions to this list. 

The current economic depression has not yet seemed to af- 
fect system sales. Apple sales remain constant while the up- 
starts, IBM and Osborne, continue to sell well. But software 
sales are definitely soft. April was a particularly anemic month, 
reversing the usual trend in which April starts a sales resur- 
gence from the weak winter market. 

Some retailers attribute part of the weakness to the spate of 
me-too, look-alike arcade products. Buyers are having diffi- 



culty distingnishong one new product from another and are 
therefore sitting on the sidelines or buying such products as 
Wizardry and MasterType that are clearly distinguishable 
from the pack. 

Applications software is not nearly as susceptible to that 
kind of buyer confusion, which partially accounts for the 
strength of those products vis-a-vis entertainment software. 

Likewise, the addition of strong new entries, such as Soft- 
ware Arts's forthcoming calculator, lend strength to that seg- 
ment of the marketplace. Unless, of course, Bricklin and 
Frankston turn out to be mere mortals after all.
