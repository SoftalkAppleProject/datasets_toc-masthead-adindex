Alan Nayer was a close runnerup for 
first prize in the Contest Contest with his 
contest, ASCn Railroad. It's a word 
game and a number game and a com- 
puter game all rolled into one. And it's 
hard. 

First prize in the contest will be $100 
worth of the Softalk advertisers' prod- 
ucts of your choice. Up to five runnersup 
will win an extra year's free subscrip- 
tion to Softalk. In case of ties, the Apple 
random number generator will deter- 
mine the winner and the runnersup. 

Beginning with this month, all sin- 
cere contest entrants who were not 
already eligible for the $18 subscription 
rate for Softalk will become so by virtue 
of their entry in a contest. 

Deadline for the contest is March 16, 
1982. 

Here are the rules for ASCII Rail- 
road, as Alan Nayer wrote them. 

Fill each of the 27 "railroad cars" in 
the chart with a decimal digit. Each pair 
of digits forms the decimal representa- 
tion of an ASCn code. Except for the first 
and last digit, each pair of digits over- 
laps with its neighbor; the second digit of 
a number is also the first digit of the next 
number. 

Clues may relate to the meaning a 
character has in one of Apple's lan- 
guages or operating systems, the char- 
acter name (nul, soh, and so on) , or the 
character itself. Sometimes, poetic li- 
cense was used, or even abused. Re- 
member: the digit pairs are the deci- 
mal, not hexadecimal representation, and 
the code 0 through 9, when used, should 
contain a leading zero. 

Here is a brief example (with 
answers) : 

A B C D 



A. 



M»l I |3| 

S — ■ — ■ — ■ — ■ — m- 

Some languages prefer this as the lit- 
eral delimiter (the apostrophe char- 
acter ' which is decimal 39) 



Enticement to 
carat or 94) 



a horse (carrot. 



C. Basic subscript delimiter (end pa- 
rentheses, 41) 

D. Its name is a holdover from the type- 
writer (CR, 13) 

A. Alarm clock for DOS 

B. Footnote 

C. Underwater vessel (abbr) 

D. Prompt character 

E. Computerized eraser 

F. Arithmetic operator 

G. Realistic minimum number of drives 
for Pascal 

H. Oops! 

I. Golfers need this to boot up 
J. Immediate AND opcode 

K. New England state (abbr) 

L. Down, but not back 

M. Hara-kiri in Pascal 

N. Hara-kiri in Basic 

O. Pascal default exec delimiter 

P. Innocent exclamation 

Q. Spanish affirmative 

R. Statement separator 

S. Second person singular or plural 

T. Default maxfiles 

U. There's more than one way to go 
home 

V. Half of our northern neighbor 

W. Uke F 

X. String suffix 

Y. It prints in Applesoft 

Z. It's NOT in Integer; it's not in 
Applesoft

CONTEST WINNERS 

1981 Oracle Retires 
With New Disk][ 




Oracle '81 winner Jim Gam (left) shown with AM Com- 
puter Products President Dave Alfano (right). Ganz, of 
West Hartford, Connecticut, took home a second disk 
drive for his prophetic answers to our year-long contest. 

Oracle '81. "When everybody around 
here first found out I won, we were all 
going crazy! Now I'm kind of nonchalant 
about the whole thing." 

So said eighteen-year-old Jim Ganz of 
West Hartford, Connecticut, when he 
claimed his new disk drive last month at 
AM Computing in Southington, Connecti- 
cut. Ganz was the grand prize winner of 
Softalk' s year-long Oracle '81 contest. 
Ganz figured out the answers to the con- 
test during breakfast the morning before 
the final postmark deadline date. He only 
spent about five minutes filling out the 
entry form and never expected he had a 
chance to win. 

But as the months went by and Ganz's 
name was still in the running for the 
grand prize, he started paying attention 
to the contest with considerably more in- 
terest. Now, one extra disk drive richer, 
Ganz plans to spend a lot more time on 
Pascal. 

When asked if he had entered Oracle 
'82, Ganz replied quickly and without 
hesitation, "No way! 



"Not only because I don't need three 
disk drives or because this year's con- 
test is really tough," he said. "But every 
month last year when my Softalk would 
arrive, I had to flip open the pages and 
check the Top Thirty list and the contest 
winners [the last part of the contest dealt 
with which company would appear most 
often on the Top Thirty]. I'll be glad when 
I get Softalk this year Just to be able to sit 
back and relax with it." 

Qty Hall. Lou Meiss, winner of the 
Bonus Contest that ran in last Septem- 
ber's Softalk, chose a copy of the book 
Apple Monitor Peeled as his prize, which 




Denby the Robot (left) was on hand to congratulate Lou 
Meiss (on the right), winner of the Bonus Contest pub- 
lished in the September issue of Softalk. Meiss received 
his prize, $25 worth of goods, at Rainbow Computing in 
Northridge, California. 

he picked up at Rainbow Computing in 
Northridge, California. Meiss correctly 
identified Los Angeles City Hall as the 
major city hall hidden in a photograph in 
the September issue. 

Winning this type of a contest wasn't 
hard, according to Meiss. He is a profes- 
sional photographer and has an eye for 
fine detail. In addition, Meiss works In a 
building situated right across the street 
from the city hall he correctly identified. 
The lucky winner used his $25 gift certifi- 
cate for the book, which he hopes will 
help him with programming.

mputer 
art 

competition 





It's not surprising that Mark Pelczarskl, author 
of the Complete Graphics System and Special Ef- 
fects, is an art lover. Some of us might be a bit sur- 
prised, however, that he's willing to consider lov- 
ing our art. Well, he'd like to see it anyway, and the 
guest contest he's sponsoring this month guaran- 
tees he'll get the chance. 

The Penquin Computer Art Competition has 
three parts, any or all of which you can enter. 

Contest 1: Computer Drawing. Prize will go to 
the best full screen picture created using any 
graphics program on the market or one written by 



the contestant. Drawings may be in color or black 
and white. Originality will weigh as heavily as 
execution in the Judging. 

Contest 2: Computer Calligraphy. Prize will rec- 
ognize the best original type font (of text charac- 
ters). Font must be compatible with either Pen- 
guin's Character Generator or Synergistic Soft- 
ware's Higher Text. A written statement accom- 
panying the entry disk must specify which char- 
acter generator the entry will work with and 
whether it is a small or large font. 

In addition to the prize, the best fonts entered 
will be included in a fonts disk Pengtiin will pro- 
vide to users of their graphics products, with full 
acknowledgment of the contributors. If you want to 
enter this contest but do not want your font includ- 
ed on this disk, simply specify this ; it will in no way 
affect your chances of winning. 

Contest 3: Computer Animation. Prize will go to 
the best moving screen picture, moving sculpture, 
or animated drawing that runs without any user in- 
teraction. Entries that require user input will be 
disqualified. Time limit for the entire program 
from start to finish is two minutes. Entry disks 
must be accompanied by written title of program 
and all files needed by the program must be loaded 
automatically by the program. 

General Rules: 

1. All entries must arrive at Softalk no later 
than March 31. (The gremlins are apt to get them if 
they arrive the following day. . . .) 

2. All entries must be submitted on disk, but 
multiple entries are permitted on one disk as long 
as a written and clearly understandable catalog ac- 
companies the disk. Pengtiin promises to return 
any disks that are accompanied by proper postage 
and proper packaging; disks not so accompanied 
will not be returned. 

3. Any entrants wishing to be considered for 
Softalk' s Bonus (explanation follows) must put 
their entries to all three contests on the same disk. 

4. Pengtiin will be the final judge. Entries will 
be judged on originality and creativity in the use of 
the Apple hi-res graphics capabilities. All deci- 
sions are final. 

5. Entries must be accompanied by your name, 
address, and phone number, both in writing and on 
any submitted disk. 

Prizes. First prize in each category will be $150 
worth of any software advertised in Softalk. Sec- 
ond prize winners will receive copies of Penguin's 
package. The Graphics Magician; third place 
prizes are copies of Pengtiin 's Special Effects. If a 
second or third place winner already owns the prize 
they've won. Penguin will substitute another Pen- 
guin product of the contestant's choice. 

Mark Pelczarskl and the Penguin wish you good 
luck and happy creating. 

Softalk's Bonus. If any one Individual should 
place first, second, or third in all three contests, 
Softalk will award that person $100 in prizes chosen 
from any of Softalk' b advertisers. In the event that 
more than one person achieves these lofty heights, 
the random number generator will be put to work 
again to choose the bonus winner.

E-Z Draw 



E-Z Draw is a graphics editing 
package for Apple II BASIC with 
simple one character commands 
so it can easily: 

• Draw dots, lines, parallelo- 
grams, triangles, circles and 
ellipses on the screen, 

• Move any area of the screen to 
any other area, 

• Transform any area of the 
screen into its mirror image 
while expanding or compress- 
ing its width or height or rotat- 
ing it 90 degrees, 

• Draw text on the screen using 
any of 20 original and imagina- 
tive type styles using the 
Higher Text Character Genera- 
tor by Ron & Darrell Aldrich, 

• Save images and complete 
pictures to the disk for use 
within BASIC programs, and 

• Draw using any of the Apple 
BASIC colors. 

This program has been used by 
professional programmers to 
generate spectacular hi-res pic- 
tures for use with their games, 
professional packages and edu- 
cational software. It can be used 
to create professional illustra- 
tions, graphs and slides in addi- 
tion to adding hi-res graphics to

FEBRUARY 1982 



War ... 

I am an Apple owner, a university In- 
structor, and an avid reader of your 
magazine. I feel that Softalk is one of the 
finest magazines available for the Apple 
computer. I wholeheartedly recommend 
it to all Apple owners, and I have learnt a 
great deal from reading your articles and 
software listings. 

But I must tell you that I feel that the 
advertisement for Street Life that you al- 
lowed to run on page 175 of your Decem- 
ber issue and which also ran in the No- 
vember issue on page 107 is not good. In 
fact I feel that it is really bad. I neither 
care what consenting adults do, nor 
would I try to dictate my morality on 
anyone else. But I have two sons (ages 11 
and 15) who are also readers of Softalk 
and as a conscientious parent it is my re- 
sponsibility to concern myself with what 
they read, do, and what they expose 
themselves to in general. As publishers 
you must realize that a great deal of your 
reading audience and the personal com- 
puter constituency is made up of teen- 
agers who are influenced by the things 
that you print and the software that is 
made available to them through your 
magazine. 

The ad clearly shows a street walker 
and the text tells how this game "puts 
you in control of up to ten ladies of the 
night." 

I can't believe that you are so de- 
sirous of advertisers that you would not 
realize that this kind of ad glamorizes 
pimps and sets a very bad example for 
minds in general and young minds in par- 
ticular. It is not desirable to depict nor to 
use women as sexual objects that are to 
be used to earn money with. Even to en- 
courage people to fantasize in this activity 
is a great misdirection of energy and 
values. 

I realize that the ad is probably geared 
to adults (although nowhere does it so 
specify — nor can anyone control who 
mail-orders) but, none the less, children 
and teenagers will read the ad if it's in 
your magazine and will be tempted to 
buy and/or trade this program. I for one 
do not want to encourage my sons to play 
at "being pimps, avoiding police, and 
looking for eager 'Johns,' " etc., as is ad- 
vertised in this ad. 

I guess that computer magazines will 
have to face the fact that a time of deci- 
sion making is fast approaching, and that 
software will be becoming more and 
more sexual. Are you an adult magazine 
or a family magazine? Will you adver- 
tise for anyone who is willing to pay you 
money or will you insist on a certain level 
of truly useful, educational, and benefi- 
cial products to serve the real interest of 
your clientele? 

I strongly recommend, therefore, that 
you and your staff take another look at 
this ad and really think about whether 
this is the type of material that you wish 
to make available to your readers. 
Lawrence Galante, New York, NY 



D I S ( U 



And Peace 

I feel I must respond to two letters in the 
November 1981 "Open Discussion." 
They are "A Letter to On- Line" and 
"Vacuous Sex Symbol Misrepresents 
Women," both on page 22. Incidentally, I 
am not associated with On-Line Systems 
or with any other software publisher. 

Richard Gillett objects to the Soft- 
pom Adventure ad turning Softalk into 
"cheesecake." This reminds me of a 
Popular Science article on color photog- 
raphy being criticized for using pictures 
of a girl in a modest two-piece bathing 
suit to demonstrate flesh tones. If the 
Softpom models were actually posed any 
lower in the hot tub, they would drown. 
You can see considerably more bare 
flesh at any public swimming pool. 

As a recent Softalk recipient, I don't 
have any back issue with an ad on page 
70 that Mary Miller Smith could find of- 
fensive. Her comment, "Women will 
never get out of the bedroom if this type 
of advertising is continued," suggests it 
was Softpom, Street Life, or, most like- 
ly, Interlude. 

These two letters present variations 
on the theme that sex is essentially bad. 
Mr. Gillett feels Softpom, a "product 
which is as useless and unnecessary as 
its ad" is lowering the computer indus- 
try to the "gutter level." Ms. Smith finds 
a sex-related computer game a "put 
down." 

It puzzles me that I have heard so 
many protests against sex in computers 
and other areas, and so few against 
violence. How socially desirable is it to 
glorify nuclear destruction. (ABM and 
Missile Defense), piracy (Shadowhawk 
1), robbery and violence (Zorfc — my per- 
sonal favorite), and warfare (Sabotage, 
Bomber, Tank War, and Star Trek)? 

One of my feminist friends has a T- 
shirt that reads, "Woman's place is in the 
Bedroom and the Boardroom." Certain- 
ly, the time for women's social and 
economic equality is long overdue. But 
that doesn't mean that a woman is neces- 
sarily being exploited when she enjoys 
sex. One of the major advances of Wom- 
en's Liberation has been the number of 
women now insisting on their right to a 
satisfying sex life. This assertion is 
shocMng in a culture that raises its chil- 
dren with the myth that there is some- 
thing wrong with a girl who desires sex, 
while a boy's "animal" lusts are normal 
and inescapable, although not something 
to be discussed in mixed company. I find 
it interesting that, according to Time, 
Softpom author Chuck Benton has been 
deluged with requests for a female ver- 
sion. 



O P E H 
S S I O H 



War games can be a harmless outlet 
for aggression. Surely it's better to come 
home after a rough day and blow away a 
few Klingons than to take it out on the 
family. Maybe the sex games will help 
people defuse some of the sexual/ 
emotional time-bombs our culture has 
attempted to install in our psyches. If 
Interlude helps couples overcome a few 
of the sexual incompatibilities that are 
rending families in epidemic propor- 
tions, more power to it! 

Sex is one of God's greatest gifts to 
humanity. It can be a physical expres- 
sion of love. It can also be perverted. I 
feel the greatest perversion is to try to 
make it "dirty." As God said to Saint 
Peter, "What I have made clean, do not 
call 'unclean.' " 
James K. Olinger, Austin, TX 

Should Softalk Rate Adventures? 
With the large interest in adventure-fan- 
tasy simulations, I feel that the time has 
come for some kind of standardization. 
In the old days, it wasn't too hard to 
choose what games to buy because only a 
handful existed. Today, there are nu- 
merous games to choose from. I myself 
am a fairly experienced adventurer and 
prefer to play those games that will offer 
me a challenge. On the other hand, many 
of my friends who are just starting out 
would prefer a game that is more forgiv- 
ing to their beginning adventuring style. 

I recently ran across Birth of the 
Phoenix by Phoenix Software and was 
very impressed by the program and by 
this company's attempt to indicate by a 
numerical rating system the relative dif- 
ficulty of some of their adventures. I be- 
lieve this is a step in the right direction. 
As all neophyte adventurers already 
know, it can be quite frustrating to play 
an adventure that may be far too diffi- 
cult for their skill level. Many beginners, 
who would eventually become good ad- 
venturers, get scared off because they 
get in over their heads. Some of the ad- 
ventures on the market today are very 
sophisticated and at anywhere from 
$15.00 to $100.00, buying the wrong pro- 
gram can be very costly Indeed. 

While Phoenix Software is moving in 
the right direction, the majority of ad- 
venture and fantasy producers are very 
vague as to the relative difficulty of their 
programs. What I propose is that an in- 
dependent reviewing group such as Sof- 
talk come up with a numerical rating sys- 
tem and rate all adventure-fantasy 
games in this way. Please understand 
that this would not be a system to rate the 
quality of the programs, just the relative 
difficulty of play. A system such as this 



10

would make it much easier for the begin- 
ning, average, and advanced adventurer 
to malte a correct choice in what kind of 
skill level they want to play at. 

Ideally, all companies would submit a 
final version of their program to the re- 
view board and this board would then as- 
sign the proper difficulty number. When 
the program was made available to the 
public, it would bear the difficulty rating 
on the package and in advertisements. 

I would like to encourage Softalk or 
anyone else who may be interested in 
making adventure-fantasy simulations 
more enjoyable to feel free to contact me. 
I am anxious to hear the views of other 



adventurers as well as the views of the 
program authors themselves.

Furthering Fortran 

The Fortran review by Coats and Wald- 
man in the December issue is one of the 
better articles on such a subject. Anyone 
considering the purchase of any of the

warned of the pitfalls.

interpreting the code while the SoftCard 
is executing the code directly. 

Out of curiosity, I produced two 8809 
assembly language versions of bench- 
mark 3. The result from the first version, 
in which I emulated a very crude Fortran 
compiler (no sophisticated code and no 
optimization whatsoever), was a run- 
ning time of ten seconds. The second ver- 
sion, in which redundant operations were 
removed and initialization of the FLAGS 
array was optimized, resulted in a run- 
ning time of less than five seconds. 

I also ran benchmark 3 on a Xerox/ 
Honeywell Sigma 5 and got a running time 
of about five seconds. This test was in a 
time-sharing environment with no other 
active users. 

E. M. Greene, Ridgecrest, CA 
Pioneers Together 

I often read letters submitted to this 
magazine from users of software who are 
very unhappy about the support they re- 
ceive from the various software houses. I 
would like to take this opportunity to 
write a letter of praise for the support I 
have received from Continental Soft- 
ware in Culver City, California. 

Recently I purchased Continental 
Software's Home Money Minder for 
$34.95. I found the software I purchased 
to have some marginal program loads 
and actually found a possible bug or two 
in the logic of the program. Needless to 
say, I was very lonhappy! My first in- 
stinct was to return the software to the 
store and get my money back. Instead, I 
contacted Continental Software. I was 
immediately rushed a new diskette that 
eliminated the marginal progfram load 
problems and was put in contact with the 
programmer to resolve the "bugs." 
When one considers that the Home 
Money Minder has been essentially re- 
placed by Continental Software's new 
money manager. The Home Accountant, 
the support I received was above and be- 
yond the call of duty. 

We are often quick to criticize. In- 
stead, we should be trying to work out 
problems with the software houses. The 
home computer industry is a new fron- 
tier and we, the pioneers, must work to- 
gether with the manufacturers (who are 
also pioneers) to produce working prod- 
ucts. 

In the future when we have problems 
with software, I feel we should attempt to 
contact the software house about the 
problem. If we do not receive support 
then let's write letters to this and other 
magazines about that software house. If 
however, we do receive support from the 
manufacturer, let's hear about these 
companies, too. 

For now, thank you. Continental Soft- 
ware, for your support!

The Oracle Flunks Arithmetic 

After reading and rereading both the 



September and December 1981 issues of 
Softalk, I cannot understand the Decem- 
ber standings in the Oracle '81 contest. 

My understanding is that Part 5 was 
worth either 0, -I- 10, -1-20, or -1-30 to any 
contestant. Unfortunately, adding any of 
these to all of the leader's totals as pub- 
lished in the September issue fails to 
yield a single match with the December 
issue. If, for example, Jim Ganz's total 
after Part 4 was -13, the most he can 
have after Part 5 is -1-17. This assumes 
that he gfuessed the Dodgers would 
triumph over the Yankees. However, in 
December you reported his score as -1-22. 
Similarly, Daniel Tobias's September 
score is repeated in that issue as —15^8, 



of implying that the only scores above zero 

n- he could have would be -1-4% or -(-14%, 

not -I-93/8 as shown in December, 

is Although both of the above examples 

ly seem to indicate that a constant error of 

of -1-5 is present, my score is indeed above 

b- zero but less than +2 after Part 5 (-l-l¥8) , 

to as Softalk correctly indicated in 

jr December. Finally, it seems I was left 

al out of the September issue even though 

in my score after Part 4 was -18%, indicat- 

28 ing I was third at that point. 

Id Could you please help me to under- 

In stand the published results? 

2. Michael B. Preston, Culver City, CA 

September's information was in 
error; the error was often in scores 
recorded as five less than they ought to 
have been, but some could have been ten 
or fifteen less as well. Inadvertently, in 
updating for part 2, scores had been in- 
creased by 0, +5, +10, and +15. Only the 
first figure is correct. Scoring entries 
should have been increased by +10, +20, 
and +30, respectively. We caught this 
only during the preparation of the 
December issue and updated all scores, 
contenders or not, accordingly. Inciden- 
tally, congratulations on a fine entry. 

Orcle the Day 

I noticed that your magazine has grown 
to more than two hundred pages, and I 
congratulate you on the success of your 
excellent product. I was wondering, 
would it be possible to add one of those ad- 
vertiser's reader service cards at the 
back of the issue similar to Byte maga- 
zine's, where readers could inquire about 
several products without writing to each 
advertiser individually? 
Steve Brodsloy, Stanford, CA 

Where an action or policy might en- 
courage or discourage Apple owners 
from supporting their local dealers, 
Softalk has always opted for the course 
that favors the dealers. In this infant irv- 
du^try, most users benefit from the sup- 
port and assistance of an expert they can 
contact personally; many local dealers 
are set up to give this aid, but the more 
time and effort they are wiUing to contrib- 
ute this way, the more expensive it is for 
them. If, as soon ous they are relatively 
familiar with their computers, such a 
dealer's customers begin dealing direct- 
ly with publishers, manufacturers, or 
mail-order houses, service of this nature 
will no longer be feasible. 

More Apples Choose Engineering 

I obtained a May 1981 issue of Softalk at 
the Toronto Apple Expo, November 1981. 

In the Open Discussion section, page 
8, I read with great Interest J. W. Yee's 
letter entitled "An Engineering Apple." I 
am in the same position as J. W. Yee. 

I would Uke to request, if possible, the 
address of Johnson W. Yee, in San Fran- 
cisco, so that I might get In touch with 
him.

Also, I bought a 48K Apple II-Plus 
lised, and this May 1981 issue is the first 
I've seen. Could you let me know the sub- 
scription rates? 

V. Siciunas, Toronto, Ontario, Canada 

We are presently exploring distribu- 
tion arrangements for Canada, Austra- 
lia, Sweden, and the Orient. As soon as 
these are firm, they'll be announced in 
Softalk and inquirers will be individually 
notified. Meanwhile, an independent 
company, Bite-soft, has arranged a for- 
eign subscription plan of their oton for 
which they buy magazines from u^. You

Crystal-Clear Controversy 
I read, with interest, the letter headed 
"Trust Is Best Protection" in your De- 
cember issue of Softalk. 

Strangely enough, I have suffered the 
same experience at the same hands with 
the same lack of success. I bought a copy 
of Sands of Mars from Crystal. It didn't 
work. Nor did the replacement. Nor did 
the replacement's replacement. Some- 
what miffed, I sent a letter (copy en- 
closed) with the software to Crystal ask- 
ing for a refund. The result? Five weeks 
later I got the whole lot back with a 
rather nasty letter sticker that said, in es- 
sence, "once you've bought it, we can't 
be responsible." Frankly, their attitude 



stinks. The trouble is, I really have no re- 
course, unless there are enough ticked 
Crystal software buyers out there to start 
a class action suit? ! 

I do think that it has to be, in part, 
your responsibility, Softalk, to screen 
your advertisers and protect your read- 
ers from these sort of unscrupulous get- 
rich-quick merchants. Maybe you need to 
set up a watchdog line to allow readers 
who have been gypped to complain. 

At least demand a sample of the ad- 
vertised software and make sure it runs. 
The Sands of Mars still crashes happily, 
and the graphics/animation are puerile ! 

Please, Softalk, see what can be done 
to protect us ifrom these rip-off kings — at 
least get their programs and try them.

December issue, I would like to say a few

To the best of my knowledge, with the 
conversion of our game software for the 
Apple II to DOS 3.3, all of the trouble- 
some bugs have been taken care of. 

Although we've found the majority of 
software buyers to be honest and ethical, 
we still run into a great deal of "White 
Collar Crime" and software piracy. 

I will only be too happy to speak to 
any of our unhappy purchasers out here 
if they will call (408) 788-3125. 

It is much easier for our competitors 



to produce what we consider to be very 
primitive games and debug and test their 
products. The more complex a program 
the more difficult it is to totally debug. 

We feel it ethical to provide a work- 
ing, playable copy of our product. It 
seems at times there are individuals who 
are more interested in finding fault than 
appreciating our product and experienc- 
ing and enjoying them as is our inten- 
tion they should. 

We always are receptive to com- 
ments and useful suggestions but some- 
times cannot process orders quickly and 
at the same time argue on matters of 
suggestive opinion and personal taste. 

Again mj' lines are open for your en- 
couragement and suggestions. Pleajse 
say "Code Blue" when calling. 
John Bell, President, Crystalware, Mor- 
gan Hills, CA 

Several individuals, including some 
retailers, have offered us unsolicited 
comments on Crystal products. Two re- 
tailers sent u^ unopened packages of sev- 
eral of the Crystal games. Both sets of 
packages are 3. 2 version. When John Bell 
of Crystal called Softalk to ask for "equal 
time" to offset the negative letter in De- 
cember's Open Discussion, loe offered 
him more than equal time. Believing that 
the best argument for a negative com- 
ment is a good product and that a review 
of such a product would be far more in- 
fluential than a letter stating unbacked 
opinions, we informed Bell of the soft- 
ware we had received and of our intent to 
review some of the products. Bell was 
distressed that we did not have the new, 
"bug free" 3. 3 versions, and we expressed 
full willingness to review those versions 
rather than the ones we had if he cared to 
send them to us. If the new versions were 
fully cleaned up, we would be most 
pleased to announce that; we far prefer 
publishing good news than bad. 

However, no 3.3 versions — in fact, no 
versions at all — arrived from Crystal; so 
we proceeded to testplay the 3.2 version 
of Crystalware's six-disk-side role-play- 
ing game, Fantasyland 2040 A.D., which 
is, indeed, rife with bugs. 

Softalk does not print responses that 
are highly negative to a company with- 
out first so informing that company; 
John Bell's response to that reading was 
to ship out a set of the 3.3 Fantasylands 
by express mail, in the hope that we 
could include it in our review. 

In the interest of being absolutely fair, 
Softalk 's review of Fantasyland, includ- 
ing 3.3, will appear next month. 

We take issue with John Bell's impli- 
cation that bugs are more acceptable in 
complex software than in simpler prod- 
ucts. No program is worth the price, 
whatever that may be, if it doesn't run 
properly. If authors' programs are too 
complex to be debugged, those authors 
need to lower their expectations tem- 
porarily and work on less complex pro- 
grams that they can produce perfectly.

In addition, from all we have seen of 
Crystal's products, we believe that there 
is not one game publisher represented in 
the Softalk Bestsellers whose products 
could be considered primitive compared 
vAth Crystal's. Some of Crystal's pro- 
grams are sophisticated, but so are Ras- 
ter Blaster, Crossfire, Zork, Cyborg, Cas- 
tle Wolfenstein, Ulysses and the Golden 
Fleece, Ultima, and Wizatdry, to name 
just a few; and all of these are essential- 
ly bugfree. 

Seek and Ye ShaU Find 

The writer of this letter is executive edi- 
tor of The Living Light, an interdisciplin- 
ary review of Christian education. Inter- 
ested readers can contact him at the 
Catholic University of America, Wash- 
ington, DC 20064. 

I was intrigued by an advertisement in 
the November 1981 issue of Softalk publi- 
cizing the wares of Cross Educational 
Software in Ruston, LA (page 182). I 
have placed an order with them for sev- 
eral of their Christian education pro- 
grams. Although I suspected that such 
programs existed, these were the first I 
have seen advertised. 

Some months ago we received an un- 
solicited manuscript from someone at 
Control Data ballyhooing some of the ef- 
forts made by churches to employ com- 
puters. The appUcations that he cited all 
dealt with data processing and manage- 
ment—which is not very different in 
churches than in business (I was going to 
say, other businesses) . We rejected the 
manuscript because we didn't think it 
would interest our readers. It did set me 
to wondering, however, about what pro- 
grams have been developed for religious 
education. It seems to me that if there is 
a market for educational software in gen- 
eral education, there is also a potential 
market in religious education. 

Who might know what is being done 
along these lines? When I phoned Cross 
Eklucational Software to place my order, 
the lady who answered told me about 
GRAPE ("Group for ReUglous Apple 
Programming Exchange"). She prom- 
ised to send me some material on it. To 
your knowledge, are there other private 
groups or commercial companies that 
are producing software that could be 
used in religious education? 

The Living Light attempts to provide 
a forum for catechists and professional 
religious educators, designed to present 
developments and trends, to identify prob- 
lems and issues, to report on research, 
to encourage critical thinking and to con- 
tribute to decision-making in the field of 
religious education. 

There must be others like us who 
bought a computer for one purpose, only 
to realize that we have not begun to ex- 
ploit its full range of possibilities. In oxir 
case we use our two Apples largely for 
word-processing, but we could obviously 
be experimenting with them for use in re- 



ligious education. (I am also chairman of 
the graduate program in religion and 
religious education here at the Catholic 
University of America.)

Remember the Controller Even McGraw 
Could Make? 

The article by Silas Warner in the Octo- 
ber 1981 issue entitled "The Controller 
Even You Can Make" was a very inter- 
esting and useful article regarding appli- 
cations of an I/O board with the Apple 
computer. However, Mr. Warner's flip- 
pant remark on page 134, "This principle 
can be expanded easily to cover eight col- 



umn lines," is typical of many computer 
writers. 

As suspected, it was not easy, in fact 
three of us have worked on this for two 
weeks. We are quite certain now that we 
do not have a hardware problem, but that 
the difficulty lies in the software. 

Perhaps you might be able to prevail 
on Mr. Warner to furnish the necessary 
changes to the program to read and print 
correctly an eight-by-eight matrix of 
chess board squares. I know how to do 
the data, the problem is with the ex- 
pected code changes we have made, we 
get stepping up the data table on a 
diagonal basis, not on a row basis.

I have to assume there is a program 
error. That being the case, I am svire you 
have heard enough complaints from dis- 
gruntled readers of your great magazine 
that you don't need any more abuse on 
the subject, but really, until they come 
out with Apple IV with the "OGT" 
mnemonic button — "Ought To Run" — 
any help you can provide would be 
appreciated.

Maybe The Typos Were Trying To Tell 
Us Something 

Referring to the Basic Solution in the De- 
cember 1981 issue of Softalk, I regret to 
have to inform you that the Catalog Hel- 
lo program submitted by Brad Stone is in 
all probability a plagiarism. 

I have had this program for at least 
ten months. I do not know who wrote it 
originally, but I got it from a local Apple 
dealer as part of a free collection offered 
to regular customers. Since Mr. Stone 
says he developed it after reading the 
May issue, it certainly could not be his 
original program that I have. 

The usual evidence is available: the 
program is exactly the same; the same 
line numbers, the same variable names, 
the same format. I'd send you a listing but 
it wouldn't prove anj^hing since it is 
exactly the same as the one in your col- 
umn. 

I don't know what "the basic solu- 
tion" might be to such a problem. It must 
take guts if not foolishness on Mr. Stone's 
part to take a chance to have this pub- 
lished where thousands of readers have 
the opportxinity to recognize it! 
Jerome I. Weintraub, El Cajon, CA 

Being an avid reader of your magazine, I 
was very surprised to discover that the 
"Hello Program" in the Basic Solution 
column of the December 1981 issue was 
an exact copy, except for many errors, of 
a program that appeared in Creative 
Computing's "Apple Cart" of September 
1980. I'm sure the person given credit 
would be very embarrassed if Bob San- 
der-Cederlof , the real author, pointed this 
fact out to him. 

I enjoy your magazine very much and 
hope you continue its many fine and in- 
teresting articles, but please be more 
careful ! 

Paul R. Mueller, Muskego, WI 



Utah who attends university-level pro- 
gramming classes. He and a friend used 
to write and modify programs together 
up to sixteen months ago, when the friend 
moved. This program was primarily the 
friend's, and Brad thought it was origi- 
nal. Brad uses his programming knowl- 
edge mostly to help in his father's real 
estate business. 

There appears to be no way to pre- 
vent the possibility of a similar problem 
occurring again, as long as we're willing 
to print the programs of our readers. 
While we regret greatly having pre- 
sented you a program that was not origi- 
nal, and while we regret equally the fail- 
ure to credit the proper author at the 
time, we believe your participation in 
Softalk is important, and we're willing to 
take the chance. We have confidence that 
very few of our readers would consider 
sending vs unoriginal programs as their 
oion, especially ivith today's evidence 
that the rest of our readers won't let them 
get away with it. 

Printing Out Programs Has Its Ups and 
Downs 

Like others, I have been frustrated by not 
being able to output both upper and low- 
er case on my printer from Basic or Ap- 
plesoft programs. After a short study of 
the assignment of the ASCII codes, I was 
able to come up with a very simple sub- 
routine that allows me to output both up- 
per and lower case on my printer with a 
minimum of complication and overhead. 

To use the subroutine, one merely de- 
fines the string SENT$ as the phrase to 
be printed with the letters to be capi- 
talized preceded by an @. Letters not 
preceded by an @ will be printed as 
lower case. Setting the variable ZN=10 is 
the same as HTAB (10) and starts the 
phrase in the tenth character position. 
GOSUB 9000 to the subroutine then 
causes the phrase to be printed as 
desired. 

This works well for me and has been 
tested on an attached IBM Electronic 60 
and an Epson MX-80. I'm sure that it will 
work for most printers hooked to an Ap- 
ple, with lower case capability of course, 
with little or no modifications. 

A copy of the subroutine with a sam- 
ple program and phrase follows. I hope 
that this can be included in your Open 
Discussion section.

Another Way To Chase the Blues 

I refer to your October 1981 issue of Sqf- 

talk, page 14, "The 01' Reset Blues." 

Reset blues have been experienced by 
most Apple owners. As medicine for the 
"Or Reset Blues," I have seen several 
articles describing solutions, but the best 
I have tried is as follows: 

Start by purchasing, from your local 
hardware store, a Vs inch 0-ring gasket. 
(¥8" is an approximate size.) Then re- 
move the reset button by gently prjdng 
upward with a small screwdriver, place 
the 0-ring gasket over the button shaft, 
and replace button cap. 

This modification allows full use of re- 
set button without the need of a special 
device, such as a pen. The modification 
requires a little extra pressure to actu- 
ate the reset, but accidental reset is near 
impossible, unless you are a gorilla of a 
typist.

The subroutine from the December 
1981 Basic Solution, as corrected in the 
January 1982 column, was indeed the

The Pains of Imperfection 

Is the Apple Pascal lORESULT function 
really broken, or is this another one of 
those petty oversights on my part? 

The most elementary concern for the 
user of a program would dictate that 
he/she not be punished with a fatal run- 
time error every time a mistake is made 
in entering a numerical value. Under 
program control, Apple Pascal does not 
allow a single error — an unacceptable 
situation for input intensive programs. 

Taking the Apple Pascal Language 
Reference Manual at its word, the fol- 
lowing function would make life a lot 
easier for the user: 
function 

ENTER ( VN AME : string) : real ; 
(*$I-*) (*tum off the fatal 10 feature*) 
var X:real; 
begin

(*$I-I-*) (*in case you want your 
program to go belly up for a 
simple error elsewhere*) 

However, this procedure does not work. 
It will gladly accept the literal i4 as a 
"real number," returning an lORESULT 
value of 0. The same function without I- 
will give a "bad format" runtime error 
(lORESULT = 14). 

A variant of this function for avoiding 
runtime errors due to the unavailability 
of a requested disk (lORESULT = 9) 
works fine. 

Summarizing: The I- compiler 
option changes the behavior of the 
lORESULT function some of the time. 
Seems like nonsense. Does anyone know 
of a fix or a dodge? 
E. Kurt TeKolste, Mililani, HI 

HeUo, DoUy? 

I have a hobby that I feel may be of some 
interest to your readers. This hobby is 
more fun than any hobby I have ever 
had, and I seem now to know more peo- 
ple across the country than I ever 
dreamed of. I haven't met most of the 
people in person, I know them only from 
their typing. I know this will sound con- 
fusing, but I am the Matchmaker of 
"Dial-Your-Match." What I'm going to 
attempt to do is explain my hobby in 
more detail. 

The excitement lies in a type of com- 
puter program commonly known as a 
CBBS. This stands for Computer Bulle- 
tin Board System. Anyone who has a 
computer can run a CBBS. A person can 
write a CBBS program or purchase a 
prewritten one at a computer store. This 
program turns the owner's computer in- 
to a type of phone answering machine. 
Once properly set up, people with "re- 
mote terminals" can call up the comput- 
er over the telephone and operate the 
computer from anywhere in the world 
they happen to be. Most CBBSes are run 
by private individuals as a club meeting 
place or just as a message system. As a 
caller, depending on the type of Compu- 
ter Bulletin Board System, you can read 
messages or enter messages, and some- 
times the system will even give you free 
computer programs. 

A sysop [for system operator] is the 
term given to the person who runs the 
CBBS. Sometimes a CBBS will allow the 
caller to commimicate with the sysop in 
"chat" mode. This allows the user to talk 
to the sysop by typing in the conversa- 
tion over the terminal. The sysop can Im- 



mediately respond by typing back. Of 
course, a better way to communicate 
with the sysop would be for both parties 
to pick up'the telephone, but this is Just 
not as much fun! 

As I said before, I am a sysop. I run a 
CBBS known to people throughout the 
United States as Dial-Your-Match. I don't 
like the name "sysop," so I go by the 
name of "Matchmaker." 

Dial-Your-Match, a CBBS, is a pro- 
gram that was not purchased. It is a com- 
puter program that took me two months 
to design and write. It runs on my Apple 
computer. Anybody, anywhere in the 
world, can call Dial-Your-Match. It's 
free, other than long-distance phone 
charges, and available to anyone with ac- 
cess to a "remote terminal." 

Dial-Your-Match is not like most 
CBBS systems. The first thing my com- 
puter does when a person calls is have 
them answer a personal questionnaire. 
This questionnaire gets information such 
as your name, age, sex, sexual prefer- 
ence, height, values, hobbies, and so on. 
It also asks questions relating to the per- 
son's personality. When complete, this 
questionnaire is filed and is used to lo- 
cate possible matches from the list of 
other people who have called Dial-Your- 
Match. Once the person has a list of 
matches, they can selectively "browse" 
any or all of those people's question- 
naires. If a good prospect is located, the 
person may want to send private mail. 
The computer stores this mail internally 
and will list it out only when the ad- 
dressed person calls the system again. 
People who are not satisfied with their 
matches can also advertise themselves 
on a "Public Bulletin Board." When per- 
sons are finished with the system, they 
are encouraged to leave comments to 
me, the Matchmaker. 
[Here followed a lengthy list of positive 
comments. ] 

I'd like to share an interesting experi- 
ence that occurred on my system a few 
weeks ago. On the public bulletin board 
was posted the following message (of 
course I've changed all the names) : 
"Well, Matchmaker, the system has real 
people on it. Just thought I would let you 
know that you have brought people to- 
gether. And across 3,000 miles. This af- 
ternoon, John from California flew to 
Florida. We met him at the airport and 
have been partying ever since." 

A few days later, the bulletin board 
contained the following message from 
John: "I have to write and tell you that I 
am extremely pleased with your board 
and the fact you made me a good match. 
I just got back from a trip ... I hope to go 
again soon. I am in Atlanta right now, but 
you made me a match that is 100 percent 
great!" 

And a few days after that, I received 
the following comment from John: 
"Please erase this account. My match 
and I found each other. Don't need this 
service anymore. Thank you very much

I've operated Dial-Yoior-Match for six 
weeks now [mid December] and my com- 
puter has received more than 4,500 tele- 
phone calls. There is never more than a 
one-minute delay between the time one 
person hangs up and the next person 
calls. I turn off the ring on the telephone 
at night so I can sleep, but the match- 
making process goes on, twenty- four 
hours a day, seven days a week. You see, 
I am not required to do anything; the 
computer answers the phone, hangs it up, 
and keeps track of all calls.

Hl-Res Help for Ace Teems In 

Many letters have arrived to answer Ace 
Colter's letter in the December issue, in- 
cluding some OS many as eleven pages 
long, and a fine one from a young man in 
Huntington, West Virginia, who forgot to 
include his name. Following are repre- 
sentative, and, while somewhat repeti- 
tive, offer unique approaches. 

This is a response to Ace Colter's letter in 
the December '81 Softalk, asking for the 
locations of the Apple's hi-res routines. 
This is something that I feel Apple should 
have included in the Reference Manual 
along with the lo-res routines. 
These are: 



HGR $F3E2 
HGR2 $F3D8 



HCLEAR $F3F2 
HCLEAR2 $F3F6 

POSTN $F411 



HPLOT $F457 



Both of these routines act 
just like the Applesoft 
commands of the same 
name, clearing the ap- 
propriate screen to black 
and switching to it. Sim- 
ply do a JSR to the loca- 
tion. 

This will Just clear the 
page to black if it is 
JSRed to. 

This will clear the page to 
the last color plotted. To 
use it, hplot a dot some- 
where, then JSR to here. 
This is the subroutine 
used to tell the Apple 
where It will hplot or 
where it will draw a 
shape. The X coordinate 
should be in the X and Y 
registers (most signifi- 
cant bite in Y) and the 
vertical coordinate in the 
accumulator. Then sim- 
ply JSR to the address. 
This does Just what it 
says, using the coordi- 



nates given to postn, and 
the hcolor set. 
HLINE $F53A This will draw a line from 
the last plotted point to 
the point sent to the sub- 
routine. This point should 
have the X coordinate in 
the X register and the ac- 
cumulator (most signifi- 
cant byte in X) and the 
vertical coordinate in the 
Y register. Note the dif- 
ference here from postn 
sfetup. 

DRAW $F601 This will draw or xdraw a 
XDRAW $F65D shape. Use postn to tell 
the Apple where to draw 
the shape, then place the 
address of the shape to be 
drawn in X and Y (most 
significant byte In Y). 
Note that this address is 
the address of the shape 
itself, not the shape ta- 
ble. The rotation value 
goes in the accumulator, 
and the scale should be 
placed in location $E7. 
Then simply JSR to the 
routine. 

HCOLOR $F6F0 To use this put the num- 
ber of the color in the X 
register, then JSR. 

Using these routines will speed up the 
drawing/xdrawing somewhat, but there 
is still the annoying flickering. Using hi- 
res images is much more satisfactory, 
but how to do that is even harder to find 
out than these locations. 

I wish to concur with Ted Young's let- 
ter to Roger Wagner, asking for some hi- 
res instruction. The routines I mention 
here can of course be used, but they ob- 
viously do not rise to the challenge of 
wanting to program Gorgon or Raster 
Blaster. 

I hope that these are still found useful 
by Ace Colter and other readers out 
there. 

One other location which I failed to 
mention earlier: 

If you want to draw on one page while 
displaying the other, location $E6 will do 
the trick. This is where the Apple tells it- 
self which screen is to be drawn on. A $20 
will force the Apple to draw on page 1 and 
a $40 will do page 2. 

Also, the Apple decides its color from 
what is in location 28 (decimal) . This lo- 
cation contains a value from 0 to 255. But 
there are only seven hi-res colors, you 
say. Sort of. Without going into a long, 
drawn-out discussion on how the Apple 
does its graphics, there are simply many 
different combinations possible. To see 
the possible things you can do, try pok- 
ing anything into 28, and Call 62454, which 
is the fill screen routine mentioned 
above. Or try this program: 

10 FOR X=0 TO 255 

20 POKE 28,X:CALL 62454 

30 NEXT X 

The normal colors, as you will see, are 
as follows: 0= black 42= green 85= pur- 
ple 127= white 128= black 170= orange 



213= blue 255= white. 

By poking a value into 28 and 
hplotting, you can achieve some very 
strange effects, some of which could be 
useful in games. 
Mason Jones, Ann Arbor, MI 

I have recently read many letters from 
people who are interested in the loca- 
tions of the Applesoft ROM graphics rou- 
tines. The only list I have found was in 
the March/ April 1980 issue of Apple Or- 
chard, but almost all of the entry points it 
listed were incorrect, so I spent several 
hours attempting to correct them. The 
correct routines are: 

HGR $F3E2 same as Applesoft com- 
mand 

HGR2 $F3D8 

HCLR $F3EC clear screen to black 
BKGRND $F3F6 clear screen to color in 
$1C 

HPOSN $F411 position the hi-res cursor 
without plotting. A = 
vertical, Y = high hori- 
zontal coordinate, X = 
low horizontal coordi- 
nate. A, X, and Y must be 
set on entry. 

HPLOT $F457 positions the cursor with 
hposn, and then plots a 
dot of color in $E4. A, X, 

Y registers same as in 
hposn. 

HLINE $F53A draws a line from the last 
plotted or positioned 
point to: 

Y = vertical coordinate, 
X = hi horizontal, A = 
low horizontal. 

SETHCOL $F6EC sets hi-res color to X (X is 
0 to 7) 

Hex values of colors: 
01234567&0 2A55 7F 
80 AA D5 FF 
DRAW has two entry points: $F601, and 
$F605. Use $F601 If the shape 
definition (not the start of the 
table ! ) you want to draw is pointed 
to by Y,X (Y is high, X is low) . The 
conventional shape drawer 
(Applesoft draw) is first a JSR 
$F730 followed by the JSR $F605, 
where X is the shape number to be 
drawn, and the start of the table is 
pointed by $88.89. 

For both, the cursor must be 
hposned, and A = the rotation 
factor, $E4 = the color, and $E7 = 
scale. 

XDRAW identical procedure as draw, but 
exchange $F65D for $F601, and 
$F661 for $F605. The $F730 is the 
same. 

The value of byte $E6 decides what hi- 
res page you plot on : $20 for page 1, or $40 
for page 2. On the draw function, the ro- 
tation you just used is stored in $B5, and 
the last color plotted is $1C. The func- 
tions above are nearly identical to the 
ones described by the January 1978 Apple 

II Reference Manual on page 46. 

In response to Ted Young's letter in 
Softalk' s December 1981 issue, which 
asked why Apple did not say where their 

GOTO 82 



Starfire 5. The disk drive that wont play hide-and-seeic 




What do we mean by that? 

You chose the Apple II, and it's a good 
computer choice. 

But Apple diskette drives play hide-and- 
seek with your valuable data. 

And if you're not looking for a diskette, 
you're worrying about scratching one. 

Besides, they're just too slow and hold too 
little. 

That's why your Apple II needs a REAL 
business partner. 

Like Starfire 5, the 5 IVlegabyte Winchester 
disk from Corona. 



The one that holds 38 diskettes of data, 
available instantly, and can alphabetize 
a mailing list 5 to 10 times faster. 

The one that seals your data off from 
danger and insures it with DataGuard 
automatic data protection. 

Double-volume data files. 

And best of all, Starfire 5 lets your files be 
twice as long, beating a crucial limitation 
of Apple's disk operating system, without 
abandoning it. 

That's the kind of partner your Apple II 
needs to let it fulfill its computer promise. 



At $2995, it's quite a deal. 

So ask your dealer to show you Starfire 5 
from Corona. 

Or call us for the local dealer who can. 

Because Starfire 5 is the BUSINESS partner 
for your Apple II.

It's hard to do compound Interest calculations in your head. 

Probably that's because the arithmetic weight-training that 
we do early in our lives rarely gets beyond linear functions. 
That is to say, all of us — or at any rate those of us who grew up 
in precalculator days — developed at least some familiarity 
with multiplication tables. Hence it's not too hard for us to fig- 
ure out in our heads that if Uncle Sam and his ilk are going to 
take away a third of a $27,000 income, we're going to be al- 
lowed to keep $18,000, and that if we double our income and 
have to give up half of it, we improve our position by only $9,000 
or 50 percent. 

Even if we have to assist ourselves with paper and pencil to 
do them exactly, we usually have a fairly good notion of where 
such calculations are going, because they only involve simple 
multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. 

Calculations concerning compound interest get us into 
deeper water because they involve exponentiation, or taking 
something to the power of something else. Few of us learn the 
powers of five — let alone the powers of one-fifth — the way we 
learn times tables. Most of us are content to leave that kind of 
figuring to accountants, or to our banks and their computers. 

Yet a lot of us are paying 20 percent of more these days for 
credit, so the powers of one-fifth do indeed have some rel- 
evance to our lives; they have a lot to do, in fact, with those 
shocking numbers that appear on the MasterCard bill at the 
end of the year, under the heading, "Total interest paid in 
1981." 

One of the great virtues of VisiCalc is its ability to reveal 
the long-range consequences of financial decisions we make. 
The program is an especially valuable tool when applied to 
those problems, like compound interest, where our own intui- 
tion tends to be a little imprecise. 

We're going to look at interest from a positive point of view 
this month, as we build a VisiCalc model to calculate the fu- 
ture value of an investment. The banks were busy touting In- 
dividual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) around the beginning of 
the new year, so we'll use our model to check out the long- 
range consequences of opening and maintaining an IRA. 

First, the mathematics. 

If you invest $1,000 and get a 10 percent annual return on 
your money, then at the end of a year, your Investment will be 
worth the original $1,000 plus 10 percent more, or a total of 
$1,100. Calling the original investment P and the interest rate I, 
the value of your investment, V, after a year would be deter- 
mined by this formula: 

V = p * (1 + I) 

At the end of a second year, the value of the investment 
would be 110 percent of what it was at the end of the first year. 
That value, call it V(2), could be found by this formula: 

V(2) = P * (1 + I) * (1 + I) 

But (1 -(- 1) * (1 -I- 1) can be written as (1 -I- 1) a 2, so, to state 
the case more generally, the value V(Y) of an investment P 
that earns interest I compounded annually for Y years after Y 
years is found by the formula: 



V(Y) = P * (1 * I) A Y 

If the interest is compounded more often than annually, the 
picture becomes only slightly more complex. If our ten per- 
cent annual interest were compounded quarterly, we would 
plug a rate of 2.5 percent into the formula and multiply the ex- 
ponent by four. If we let N represent the number of compound- 
ing periods per year, then the general formula for the future 
value of our investment becomes: 

V{Y) = P * (1 + l/N) A Y * N 

This is the formula we'll use in our VisiCalc model. 

Clear a worksheet and set recalculation to manual, with a 
/GRM. The automatic recalculation feature tends to slow 
things down when you're building a complex model. You can 
always set it back to automatic later, if you wish. 

We're going to need space for some fairly wide numbers, so 
set the column width to twelve with a /GC12. And since most of 
the information on the sheet will represent amounts of money.

you Can do a /GF$. We'll override that format in a few loca- 
tions. 

A typical IRA account advertised in Los Angeles offers 14 
percent interest compounded daily. The law permits a maxi- 
mum annual investment for a single person of $2,000; working 
couples are allowed to invest $4,000 annually. We'll work with 
the former figure first. 

Let's start by putting some labels in the area from Al to A6. 
Type in the following: 

>A1:PRINCIPAL 

>A2:INTEREST 

>A3:PERIODS 

>A4:TERM 

>A5:INT/PERIOD 

>A6:FUTURE VALUE 

You can either type that in literally, using the greater-than 
symbol and the colon to move your cursor to the appropriate 
coordinates, or just set cursor movement to vertical and hit the 
right arrow after each line. 

We'll plug our data into the corresponding cells of column 
B. Let's assume that our hypothetical working depositor is now 
twenty-one years of age and that he or she is going to make a 
single deposit this year of $2,000 and let that money ride until 
retirement day, forty-four years from now. We'll also make 
the assumption, for the sake of simplicity, that the money will 
earn a full year's interest for 1982. 

Plug in the values 2000, 14, 365, and 44 at locations Bl, B2, 
B3, and B4, respectively. At B3 and B4, you'll probably want to 
override the dollar format with a /FR. 

At location B5 we want to show the interest rate per com- 
pounding period, so type in the formula: -I-B2/B3/100. You 
need the division by 100 to convert the percentage rate into a 
decimal. When you hit return, you should get 3.835616E-4 for an 
answer, meaning that your money will earn about four hun- 
dredths of a percent interest per day. 



Finally, at B6, plug in the formula that calculates the fu- 
ture value of the investment. That formula should read: 

+ B1*((1-I-B5) A (B4*B3)) 

Note that VisiCalc's order-of-precedence rules are a little 
different from Applesoft's. In Basic you could state that 
formula as Bl*(l-I-B5) A (B4*B3) and everything would come 
out fine. Basic would figure the terms within parentheses first, 
then do the exponentiation step, and then finally multiply by Bl. 
VisiCalc, on the other hand, reverses the last two steps; it fig- 
ures the parenthetical terms first, then does everything else 
from left to right. If you leave out those apparently redundant 
parentheses in your VisiCalc formula, the result you'll get will 
read error, not because your syntax is illegal but because 
you've overflowed the limits of the system. 

You could avoid having to put in the extra parens by put- 
ting the Bl term on the right side of the formula, as + (1-I-B5) > 
(B4*B3) *B1, but you might just as well get accustomed to us- 
ing a lot of parens. In VisiCalc, when in doubt — or when in er- 
ror—check to see if you're assuming something other than a 
left-to-right order of precedence and add parens as necessary. 

Now that you've got it right, B6 should be displaying a fairly 
impressive six-figure number, showing that $2,000 left in the 
bank for forty-four years, gathering interest at 14 percent com- 
pounded daily, will grow to $945,736.17. 

To observe the effects of changing the compounding pe- 
riod, try putting in different values at B3. Hit an exclamation 
point after each new entry to calculate the results. Notice, for 
example, that if the money is compounded annaully instead of 
daily, the effect will be drastic. At the end of the forty-four year 
term, the difference in the value of the investment will be 
about $300,000. 

Suppose now that we want this worksheet to reflect your 
situation and that you're no longer twenty-one. Set your cursor 
anywhere on row 4 and type /IR /IR. Lti the new blank posi- 
tions at A4 and A5, type the labels AGE and RETIREMENT.

TASC The Applesoft Compiler. 
It turns your Apple into 
a power tool* 



Step up to speed. TASC, the Applesoft Compiler, 
converts a standard Applesoft BASIC program 
into super-fast machine code. By 
increasing program execution speed 
up to 20 times, Microsoft gives 
you a power tool for Applesoft 
BASIC programming. 
Highest capacity available. 
TASC will compile and run 
larger programs than any 
other Applesoft Compiler. As a 
disk-based system, it doesn't 
require the simultaneous pres- 
ence of compiler and program 
in memory. The memory you save 
allows you to compile significantly 
bigger programs. 

Power without bulk. Code expansion of up to 100% 
severely restricts other compilers. TASC's special 
code compression schemes typically limit code 
expansion to only 25%. You'll really appreciate that 
with complex programs or programs that utilize 
Apple's hi-res graphic pages. 
More BASIC power. TASC's powerful new 
commands increase Applesoft BASIC programming 
capability. Chain with COMMON allows compiled 
programs to share variables, so a main menu 

'Applesoft IS a trademark of Apple Computer, Inc. 




supports several programs in a 
single runtime environment. 
TASC's True Integer Arithmetic 
and Integer FOR... NEXT 
capabilities maximize the execu- 
tion speed of compiled programs. 
TASC's near total compatibility 

with Applesoft speeds compil- 
ation of existing programs 
with little or no modification. 
What about mistakes? You 
perfect your programs inter- 
actively with Applesoft. If some- 
thing does slip by TASC recovers 
from errors discovered in compilation 
and traps all runtime errors. It even permits 
graceful interruptions during compilation.

Put in /FR at both B4 and B5 and plug in the appropriate 
values— your present age and the age at which you intend to 
hatch your nestegg. Now replace the value at B6 with the 
formula +B5-B4. Hit an exclamation point and the program 
will calculate with the new data. Notice that you don't have to 
do anything with the formulas that are now at B7 and B8 ; the 
insert-row command automatically adjusts the formulas to re- 
flect the new locations of the cells involved. 

So far what we've done is calculate the future value of a sin- 
gle, one-time investment. Suppose you put another two grand 
in the bank next year, two more the following, and so on until 
your retirement. Then how much will you have? 

To answer that question, the first thing we'll do is construct 
a table showing the value of the original $2,000 investment at 
the end of each year. 

Go down to A12 and enter /FL to override the current de- 
fault dollar format. Replicate this formula down to A56 by typ- 
ing /R : A12 . A56 and hitting return. Now enter the value 0 at A12 
and the formula -I-A12+1 at A13. Replicate the formula from 
A13 to A56 with /R:A14.A56:R. Now at location B12 enter the 
formula +B1. This is your initial investment, after zero years 
of growth. 

Now at B13 through B56 we're going to want to calculate the 
value of the investment at the end of one-year intervals. The 
simplest way to do this, if you have VisiCalc 3.3, is to copy the 
formula at B8 into B13, make a small change in it, using /E, 
and then replicate. If you don't have the sixteen-sector Visi- 
Calc, you won't be able to use /E, so you'll have to enter the 
formula at B13 by hand. 

Assuming you've got /E, go first to B8 and copy the formu- 
la with /R : B13 : NNNN. Do a /E, move the cursor with the right 
arrow until it sits just to the right of the B6, hit two escapes, 
enter A13, and hit return. If you're working with VisiCalc 3.2, 
go to B13 and type -I-B1*((H-B7) a (A13'*B3)). 

What we've done here is copy the formula for the future 
value of our investment but used the number at A13 for the 
term of the investment. With the cursor still at A13, type: 
/R: A14.A56:NNRN and you'll have a year-by-year table of the 
value of your account, assuming only the initial $2,000 deposit. 
The bottom line, at B56, should read 945736.17, that impressive 
six-digit number that we had originally at B6. 

Position B14 shows us that at the end of a year, the $2,000 
will have grown to $2,300.49. If you now invest another $2,000, 
obviously the value of your account will jump to $4,300.49. We 
can represent that new figure at D14 by entering the formula 
-I-B14-I-B13. At the end of the second year, if you make no more 
deposits, you'll have the $2,646.12 that represents your initial 
input, plus $2,300.49 from the second deposit. That total can be 
arrived at by adding B15 and B14. 

To create a yearly table that represents two deposits, just 
replicate C14 down to C56, with /R:C15.C56:RR. 

Clearly, you can repeat this process to show the effect of 
putting in $2,000 every year. Just go to D15, enter -f-Cl5-l-B13, 
replicate, go to E16, enter +D16-I-B13, and so on. On a 48K Ap- 
ple you'll eventually run out of memory if you try to run the ta- 
ble out to forty-four years. With a RAM card you'll have 
enough memory with about 2K left over. 

If you have the patience to build this table to completion, 
you'll discover that that bottom right-hand cell, the one that 
represents the total value of the account assuming a new $2,000 
input for each of forty-four years, holds an astounding 
$7,227,140.66. 

Unfortunately, there isn't any simple way in VisiCalc to 
replicate diagonally. The relative feature in the replicate com- 
mand either increments columns, if you are replicating hori- 
zontally, or rows, if you're replicating vertically. It will not— to 
our knowledge — perform both operations at once. Anyone who 
has a simpler method to build this table (there probably is one) 
is invited to send it to Softalk Ventures, 11021 Magnolia Boule- 
vard, North Hollywood, CA 91601; we'll be delighted to print it 
here — and if we do, you'll get an extra year's free subscription 
to Softalk.

Spiralling clockwise, beginning above: Muse headquarters in Bal- 
timore — retail store is the ground floor, software publishing the

manager Jim Block; store manager Peggy Puente; and sales man-

EXEC 



BY (wic Simon 



Ed Zaron, foxinder and president of Muse Software, rubbed 
sleep from his eyes and poured a round of coffee. "I was up un- 
til four in the morning last night, thinking about this new 
database we're working on. I wasn't programming — Just lying 
in bed trying to figure out how to make certain things work the 
way I want them to. I'm really excited about it." 

Zaron has plenty of things to muse on these days. Apart 
from an exciting and consuming new software project — 
Muse's first major contribution to the art of database manage- 
ment — ^there is the company's recent expansion to ponder, 
along with the growing pains attendant thereto. Last July, 
Muse w£us a company of thirteen, crowded onto one floor of a

building on downtown Baltimore's Charles Street. Now the 
personnel list numbers thirty, an increase of about 230 per- 
cent, and the firm hfus its own three-story edifice down the 
street a block from its former lodging. 

To be precise, Zaron and Muse are in the process of making 
the new building their own. "We've completely renovated it. 
You should have seen this place. It was the pig of Charles 
Street when we moved in," Zaron recalls. "The front was com- 
pletely boarded up with plywood, with Just a little opening 
where you could look in." 

Now the front of the ground floor is a show window into a re- 
tail computer store nin by Muse. The software publishing ac- 



tivities, for which the company is more widely known, go on 
behind a bright brick facade for two floors above the retail 
store. Below the store is a basement full of people biusy with 
shipping, packing, inventory management, and other activi- 
ties vital to the day-to-day sustenance of a software company. 

The building is leased, but Muse is in the process of buying 
it; a second bviilding, nearby on the same boulevard, has al- 
ready been picked to catch the overflow from this one. 

The Agonies of Growth. Growth has brought with it 
changes, both in corporate personality and in individual life- 
styles. Muse is clearly in a state of transition, from being a 
small, closeknit alliance of friends to being an organization of 
considerable size. Zaron, who in the beginning was one of 
Muse's two principal programmers, has seen his role shift dra- 
matically in recent months. His Apple now resides at his home, 
providing less distraction from the responsibility of oversee- 
ing the whole business operation. 

Growth has brought personal conflicts as well. Besides the 
conflict between creativity and time that is often seen in soft- 
ware houses — the desire for endless refinement and improve- 
ment of product versus the need to put product on the market — 
Muse has also experienced some painful disagreement over 
purposes and methods. Jim Salmons, who had been the com- 
pany's chief of marketing, advertising, and sales, left in July 
as a result of what Zaron describes simply as "a personality 
clash." His departure is still a matter of much regret to the 
company, both because Salmons had been a close and long- 
standing friend of Muse's principals and because his talents 
have proved difficult to replace. 

When Salmons left the company, the decision was made to 
break up the marketing-advertising-sales function into two sep- 
arate divisions on the same management level. Fred Poole 
has served admirably since midsummer as sales manager, 
but the marketing-advertising slot, which was temporarily 
filled, is unoccupied as of this writing. 

Four Years Old Is Ancient. On the whole, nevertheless, 
Zaron has a lot to be pleased about in the progress of his com- 
pany. 

Muse is approaching a fourth birthday, making it one of the 
older Apple software houses. The company has distinguished 
itself, however, not merely by its longevity but also by the di- 
versity of its product line and the broad, across-the-board im- 
pact it has made upon the Apple marketplace. 

Its bread-and-butter products have been games and a word 
processor. But the company has also produced such varied 
materials as graphics utilities, plotting programs, a pseudo 
speech synthesizer that transported the user's voice under pro- 
gn:am control from tape recorder to the Apple speaker, mailing 
list utilities, and a version of the Pilot prognramming language, 
called Appilot. 

Many of these programs were ground breakers of sorts. 
U-Draw, for example, was one of the first available graphics 
utilities, and the Voice, although less impressive now that true 
speech synthesis has been achieved on the Apple, was 
unique and advanced for its time. The two games from Muse 
that held dominant positions in the Softalk bestseller lists 
through the second half of 1981— Robot War and Castle WoU 
fenstein — are both fully original, one-of-a-kind creations. 

Someone Bought an Apple. Like many other firms in this 
business. Muse W£U9 started by one individual's purchase of an 
Apple. In this instance the blessed event took place in Febru- 
ary 1978, in the early days of the Apple n. 

Zaron had spent the previous nine years in the employ of 
Commercial Credit Corporation, a subsidiary of Control Data.

INBOW COMP 




FEBRUARY 1982 



33 



For about six of these years, he had done assembly language 
progrramming on a CDC 3300, "A nice machine," he says, "but 
not as powerful as my Apple." 

A Big Surprise. On the evening of the day he made the step 
up to microcomputing, Zaron arrived home to find a fellow 
Commercial Credit employee, Silas Warner, waiting on his 
doorstep. "I don't even know how he found out where I lived," 
Zaron recalls, "but there he was, and he immediately started 
showing me how to use the thing." 

In such a manner was a collaboration conceived. 

"We picked the name Muse out of the dictionary. We were 
hoping to find something that sounded sort of like Rand, and I 
found muse and thought that looked pretty good. Silas said, 
'Great. It can stand for Micro Users Software Exchange.' Silas 
is like that — very quick, always coming up with good ideas." 

The partnership of Zaron and Warner worked out of Zar- 
on's home for the next ten months. Warner's contribution to 
the fledgling company consisted of Maze Game, Escape, and 
Side Shows, while Zaron wrote Tank War, U-Draw, and Music 
Box. The programs were all on cassette, of course; Apple's 
Disk Operating System was not even available to the general 
public until about midsummer 1978. 

The first ten months' output from Muse set a pattern that 
was to prevail throughout the company's development: War- 
ner wrote unusual. Interesting games, while Zaron concen- 
trated more on utilities and so-called serious product. This was 
by no means an invariable division of talent ; Zaron also wrote 
games, and Warner subsequently prog^rammed Dr. Memory, 
one of the first text processors available for the Apple. 

Nevertheless, Weu*ner has made his biggest impact with 
game programs — especially with Wolfenstein and Robot 
War — and Zaron was to author the company's major entry in 
the word processing market, SuperText. 

Zaron says Warner is the more creative of the two. Whether 
that is the case or not, the two men complement each qther 
well, and the balance of their abilities and inclinations ac- 
counts in large measure for Muse's broad coverage of the 
market. 

And Then Came Maggie. If that night in February marked 
the conception of Muse, its birth occurred the following No- 
vember, when the firm took up residence in a for-real office- 
one room over a gun shop in the suburbs of Baltimore. Zaron 
also hired a person to manage all the company's nonprogram- 
ming affairs— hi ventory, packing, shipping, bookkeeping, and 
general tactical and moral support. All this burden was— and 
still is — entrusted to Maggie Black. 

Freshly settled into their new country home, the small band 
of Museling^ seemed unaware of what was in store for them. 
"We thought that one-room office was so big, we didn't know 
what to do with all the space." Such comfort was brief. 

"In December of seventy-eight," Zaron remembers, "we 
sent out a Christmas special to dealers. It was Jvust a little 
mimeographed flyer, but we got a ten-thousand-dollar re- 
sponse, and we were just blown away with excitement. We 
couldn't find enough tapes to fill the orders." 

Things change rapidly in the Apple world, and the new year 
brought landmark changes for Muse as well. Early in 1979 the 
company issued Dr. Memory, which was noteworthy in two re- 
spects. It was one of the first Apple text processors, and it was 
also the first program by Muse to be released on disk. 

Forgetting Dr. Memory. Some six months after the ap- 
pearance of Dr. Memory, Zaron encountered a fellow at a 
trade show who had some rather disquieting things to say 
about the program. Zaron reacted to the criticism in a fashion 
characteristic of a prideful entrepreneur — he went home and 
commenced to revise it from scratch. The metamorphosed 
processor underwent half a year's trial as an in-house tool be- 
fore coming out in public under the name SuperText. 

Besides having become a popular piece of business soft- 
ware, SuperText claims the distinction of being the first copy- 
protected program written for the Apple. "With Dr. Memory 
we were getting many more trouble calls than we had had 



sales," Zaron says, "so we knew the time had come to start 
protecting our programs. The market was less professional 
then, and copying and trading were openly encouraged." 

Around the beginning of 1980, Muse, tired of country living, 
migrated to downtown Baltimore, setting up shop on North 
Charles. They also opened their retail store. 

Zaron says he has no plans to build the store into any kind of 
retail empire. It's intended to function as a single, indepen- 
dent profit center. "I've tried to take a hands-off attitude 
toward it," he asserts. "I want it to be a separate entity, and I 
don't want to get sidetracked by it, no matter what." 

Warner adds that the store — essentially an Apple dealer- 
ship with a large stock of software from the major Apple 
vendors — also provides a valuable link between the product de- 
velopment people at Muse and the end user, helping the form- 
er stay in touch with the needs and moods of the latter. 

Credit for keeping the retail operation profitable goes to 
Peggy Puente, who has been minding the store since last Oc- 
tober. 

Then Along Came Jim. Other significant events of early 
1980 : Silas Warner finally came on board as full-time member 
of the staff; his massive contribution prior to that time had 
been done on a royalty basis while he continued to work for 
Commercial Credit. And Jim Black, husband of business man- 
ager Maggie and another colleague and friend from Commer- 
cial Credit, became the company's manager of product devel- 
opment. Black had initiated Zaron in the rites of CDC 3300 as- 
sembly language programming back in the early 1970s. 

Aside from the splitting up of the sales-marketing-advertis- 
ing function into two coequal management positions. Muse at- 
tained its present organizational shape when Black came 
aboard. The rest of its history has been consolidation and 
growth. 

Since he joined the staff. Black has been concerned not only 
with the development of product, but with the development of 
producers as well. Although Muse has published and will con- 
tinue to publish the work of outside authors. Black intends to 
grow a strong core of inhouse programming talent. Currently 
that staff includes Dave Fitzgerald, Dave Schwartz, Tom 
Davenport, Ralph Sanchez, and Scott Diegel. 

Things To Come. The database program that keeps Zaron 
up nights is one of the current projects occupying this crew of 
programmers. Another Is an eighty-column overhaul of Su- 
perText II (scheduled to be released by the time this story goes 
to press). 

But what's really exciting people at Muse these days is the 
prospect of putting these two items together with some other 
software to form what they describe as an integrated elec- 
tronic office program. 

As they envision it, this office-of-the-near-future will be a 
massive turnkey system featuring database functions, word 
processing, interdesk communications, and "everything else 
you need to run a company." The key to the system will be a 
hard disk storage device into which each individual user will 
be cabled. 

Muse intends to stay in the business of making games and 
utilities, as well. Warner Is working on another adventure 
game, to be based on some of the concepts developed in Castle 
Wolfenstein. He's also in the process of writing an improved 
version of Appilot. 

The latter, while still in development, is already being put 
to work. At least a couple of educational programs are in the 
offing, both of which will use Appilot as a development lan- 
guage. One of these is a four-disk tutorial for adults on the sub- 
ject of writing; the programmer is Eric Kraft. 

There's a stranger in the office now, a computer that's big- 
ger than the Apple II. It's a loner, sitting off by itself in the cor- 
ner of a conference room. Odds are it's going to get some at- 
tention one of these days. But, for the present, days at Muse— 
and sometimes nights as well— are consumed by the effort to 
create a database program and an integrated electronic office 
system for the Apple. Hi

I 

To balance out your life 
Would you take Main Frame for your lawful, wedded wife 

Or husband, as the case may be? 

To have and hold 

Like taffeta or velum — 
A touching tonic for your cerebellum. 

Wrinkled more 
For coping with the Terminal . . . 

Or Monitor . . . 

Or Slave . . . 
(Auxiliaries frustrate me, 

A member of the Bourgeoisee du Stand Alone variety.) 
Than from tasting of the fatted calf 

Of random wisdom binary. 

Gargantuan and raw. 

II 

To test your mettle, then. 

Go serve the Mastermind — 

The Brain 
Which up to now has held tne key 
To Sanity, Chastity, Veracity, Integrity— 

The oceanic OM, 

Precision-honed, 

Dendritic and pervasive — 

Not to rule, Oh, no! 
But seeming to foretell 
The fate of myriad others who 

Are not equipped so well. 

Ill 

To find a random group : 

Can they pass the tests/exams. 

Complete the printed questionnaires 

That programs in the Main Frame 

Conjure up for them? 
Can a linear regression gain them entrance 
To the citadel of Eye Bee Em? 
What lies therein, my friend? 

Simply quantitative anas. 

Measured brains and alchemy 

No end.

To turn the tide for me : 

There is a special bed. 
No maze of wires and circuits (at the head) 
No place to plug a Dumbterm (at the stead) 

No longer 

Must I visit sterile, air-conditioned cubicles 

(With operators running to and fro) 

Befuddled by the revolution of each memory disk, 

Where laves the giant Behemoth, 

Numbered with her tandem sisters — 

Unisexed, more or less — 
But noting size, capacity, and dress. 

To think, I ravish her/it ... or did 

Until the micro versions came along — 

Family size, desk size, pocket size — 

I have my pick. 

V 

And frequently at dusk 

I tremble as the memory 
Of musk and wires and ozone, plastic buttons, diode lights 

Invades my senses 

Longing for an old connection. 
Then, weak but resolute 
I tiptoe to my Apple II 
Select a program (depending on the mood) 

And let it digitate 

Undulating freely 

Till the problem finds solution 

In one glorious burst 

Of panoramic 30 resolution 
(Charged seminal particles, if you will). 

VI 

So keep your giant golem Brain 

Your mighty Main Frame, 

Cold, electric paramour. 

My Apple serves me well 

Hooked up and in tune 

To my arhythmical cadenza.

There's a Powerrul Word Processor 

pascal 
Hiding in Your^Appie 



Bv ALLEH mmo 

•'You can't use the Pascal Editor for 
word processing," said the computer 
club newsletter editor. 

"Why not?" asked the new owner of 
an Apple Language System. "It seems 
like a nice full-screen editor, and the 
Filer is convenient, and ..." 

"How can you stand it?" the news- 
letter editor interrupted. "Every time 
you hit return, the next line starts at the 
same margin as the one before. After you 
indent for a paragraph, you've got to 
backspace to get over to the left margin 
on the next line! And, if you backspace 
one keystroke too far, you wrap back to 
the previous line and have to hit return 
and all those backspaces again." 

Worlds Unknown. The Pascal Editor 
has several modes that can be easily cus- 
tomized by the user. Like many casual 
users of the Apple Pascal system, the 
newsletter editor hasn't found the time to 
explore the full range of the Editor's 
capabilities. 

Because of its auto-indent feature, the 
default mode is the appropriate mode to 
use when writing Pascal programs. 
When the user inserts a new line in this 
mode, the Editor automatically indents 
the line to the same point as the previous 
line, making the default mode conve- 
nient for programming. Other modes are 
possible, however, including several that 
are more suitable for word processing. 

To experiment with Pascal word proc- 
essing yourself, begin by clearing the 
workfile. The workfile is a text file with 
special status to the Apple Pascal operat- 
ing system; it's the file the system is 
ready to work on. The workfile can be a 
file with a name chosen by the user or it 
can be the default workfile. The default 
workfile is called System. Wrk. Test. It 
resides on the boot diskette (the diskette 
with System.Pascal and other system 
files) , which is located in the boot drive 
(the disk drive attached to the drive 1 
connector of the disk controller card in 
slot 6 of the Apple) . 

To start a new text file rather than 
modify an existing one, you must first 
clear the workfile. To do this, enter the 
Filer (by typing F at the command lev- 
el) and type N for new. This tells the sys- 
tem it should expect to work on a new 
file. If no current workfile exists, or if the 
current workfile is not the default file, the 
Filer responds, "Workfile cleared." 

If, on the other hand, the current file 
being worked on is the default file (Sys- 
tem. Wrk. Text), the Filer asks whether 
you want to remove that file. If you don't, 



say N for no in response to the question, 
type S for save, specify a new name to 
save the file under, and then type N to 
"new the workfile." That sounds like a lot 
of hassle, but ordinarily the workfile is 
cleared with two keystrokes, F for Filer 
and N for new. 

Once you've cleared the workfile, 
type W to quit the Filer. This restores the 
command level of the system. Next, type 
E to invoke the Editor. Since there's no 
current workfile, the Editor will ask for 
one. In this example, you are starting a 
new text file rather than modifying an 
existing one, so specify the default work- 
file by simply hitting return. The Editor 
will present the edit command line at the 
top of the screen, and you'll be ready to 
begin. 

In the Editor, you have various op- 
tions. If you simply tj^e I for insert, you 
begin inserting text in the default mode, 
which, as you remember, is more appro- 
priate for Pascal programs than for text. 
What you want to do instead is to specify 
an environment appropriate for word 
processing. In the Apple Pascal system, 
this is accomplished by setting the edit 
environment. From the edit command 
level, type S for set. The set prompt line 
asks whether you want to set a marker or 
the environment. Typing E for environ- 
ment causes a half-screen menu to be dis- 
played.

The environment options displayed 
are responsible for such features as auto- 
matic indenting in the defualt mode. To 
change to a mode more suitable for word 
processing, type A for auto indent and F 
for false, then F for filling and T for true. 
This turns off automatic indenting. New 
lines now start at the left margin, unless 
they start a new paragraph. Selecting the 
filling option means that when new text is 
being inserted the Editor will automati- 
cally wrap words around to the next line 
when the right margin is reached. You 
need not hit a return unless the current 
line must be cut off before the right 
margin, such as at the end of a para- 
graph. 

Speaking of margins, you might like 
to select margins that differ from the 0 
and 79 default values. If, for example, the 
finished text is to be printed out on an 



39 

eighty-column, ten-character-per-inch 
printer such as the Epson MX-80, you 
might decide you want a 6Vi-inch long 
line of text, with a 1-inch left margin and 
a lV2-inch right margin. In this case, a 
left margin of 10 and a right margin of 75 
are what you want. Type L for left mar- 
gin, followed by 10 and return. Then type 
R for right margin, 75, and return. An ap- 
propriate paragraph indentation might 
be to the fifteenth column, five more than 
the left margin. Type P for para margin, 
15, and return. 

Through this process, you have se- 
lected a reasonable set of options for 
word processing with the Pascal Editor. 
You can change any option by typing the 
first letter of its name, followed by an ap- 
propriate value. Since you've just select- 
ed some good options, type control-C 
(called etx by the system) or hit the 
space bar or return to exit the Set En- 
vironment mode. You'll be returned to 
the top level of the Editor, labeled Edit: 
at the beginning of the command line. 

To see the effect of these environ- 
ment settings, type in a few paragraphs. 
FVom the top Editor level, type I to in- 
voke the insert mode. Use the backspace 
key to erase errors. To erase whole lines, 
use control-x for greater speed, and don't 
forget the repeat key when you want to 
hurry things up. 

Now write something. When you 
reach the end of a paragraph, hit return 
twice. This will result in two line feeds on 
the screen, the second of which will be in- 
dented to the paragraph margin auto- 
matically. When auto indent is false, two 
returns in a row are interpreted as the 
signal for a new paragraph. When typing 
control-C. Now exit the Editor by typing 
Q to quit the Editor and U to update the 
default file, System. Wrk.Text. 

System. Wrk. Text is not a very de- 
scriptive name for whatever you've writ- 
ten. To give your file a new name, enter 
the Filer by typing F from the command 
level, then type S for save-the-workfile. 
The system will ask for the new name 
of the file. File namea^ must begin with an 
alphabetic character, be less than six- 
teen letters long, and not have any spaces 
in them. Type in "Wordproc" (or any 
other name that appeals to you), fol- 
lowed by return. You have now renamed 
the default workfile Wordproc. Text. 

To print out your file, you don't even 
have to leave the Filer. If your printer 
interface is in the Apple's slot 1, the 
system software will recognize refer- 
ences to it as Printer: . Simply type T for 
transfer and when the system asks, 
"Transfer what file?" simply type in 
wordproc .text, followed by return. In re- 
sponse to "To where?", answer Print- 
er:." You have Just instructed the Filer 
to transfer wordproc to the printer. If the 
printer is on, it should begin to print the 
file immediately. The screen will remain 
black until the transfer has been com- 
pleted. 

This is how easy it is to edit natural

langtrage text with the Apple Pascal Edi- 
tor and to dump out the text files to the 
printer using the Filer's transfer com- 
mand. Although the description of the 
process is a bit long-winded, only a few 
keystrokes are required to set the edit- 
ing environment for a file, and printing 
the file requires only a few more. With a 
little practice, these short sequences of 
one-key commands will become auto- 
matic and natural to you. 

To make effective use of the Pascal 
system for editing, a user must learn to 
use a number of Apple Pascal Filer func- 
tions (see the table). With these com- 
mands, you can make backup files and 
disks and maintain disk volumes and 
files. 

Since a number of system files aren't 
required when only word processing is to 
be done, some Pascal users choose to cre- 
ate a special boot disk to use just in Pas- 
cal editing. Such a simplified disk would 
include only the files System. Apple, Sys- 
tem. Pascal, System. Miscinfo, System.- 
Editor, and System. Filer. This boot disk 
configuration provides 125 blocks for text 
files. Of course, you're likely to have 
other boot disks, complete with other sys- 
tem files, for compiling and executing 
other programs. 

On to Higher Things. This simple ap- 
proach to word processing is likely to be 
sufficient for accomplishing many unde- 
manding word processing applications, 
such as writing letters of less than one 



page. 

Many additional editing options and 
functions are useful in word processing. 
For instance, you can copy material 
from an existing file into the file you're 
currently working on. You can replace 
every instance of a particular word or 
phrase with some other word or phrase — 
an especially useful feature when you dis- 
cover you've misspelled a word consis- 
tently in a long text. You can use the find 
command to search for a particular word 
or phrase, including both capitalized and 
uncapitalized versions of the word. 

In addition, the margins can be 
altered via the set environment com- 
mands, then the margin command can 
be used to reformat the text. Margin is 
one of many available commands not 
listed in the Editor's one-line menu; it 
pays to read the documentation. To take 
full advantage of the Editor's potential, 
study chapter 4 of the Apple Pascal Oper- 
ating System Reference Manual and ex- 
periment with the use of each of the de- 
scribed commands. 

For word processing tasks more com- 
plex than simple one-page documents, 
the procedure described here for print- 
ing leaves something to be desired. If you 
use the "Transfer to Printer:" tech- 
nique, you must format carefully for the 
number of lines of text you want to ap- 
pear on a page. If you allow the text sim- 
ply to go on and on, it will print right over 
page boundaries (unless you use a print-

er that automatically skips page bound- 
aries). It's nice to have page numbers, 
too, when printing out longer texts. 

Of course, if you like, you can care- 
fully count lines of text, insert a number 
of returns after the appropriate number 
of lines for a page has been entered, and 
then type a page number and a few more 
returns to start the next page. But such 
an approach defeats one of the major 
aims of word processing— namely, easy 
alteration of the text. If you add two lines 
of text to the page, then all the carefully 
inserted page, boundaries for the rest of 
the text are no longer in the right places. 

Clearly, it's a much better approach 
to use a formatting printout program. 
Such a program performs mundane 
tasks like printing a specified number of 
lines per page, keeping track of page 
numbers, and altering marg^ins. Many 
printout programs offer other features 
such as underlining, overstriking for spe- 
cial character creation, and chained text 
file printout. Listing 1 is a very simple 
version of such a program, capable only 
of the mundane tasks of keeping track of 
page boundaries and margins. 

More elaborate programs suitable for 
a wide range of word processing applica- 
tions are available. For example, Intelli- 
gent Computer Systems advertises Qtext 
which works with Ms.Speller, a spelling 
checker program for Apple Pascal texts. 
Datamed Research offers a formatting 
printer called The Incredible Text Print- 
er, with approximately one hundred com- 
mands available. The Moonshadow for- 
matter (by Jim Merritt) from Merrimac 
Systems is yet another text formatting 
utility for users of the Pascal Editor. 

A number of public domain format- 
ting printers are available from Pascal 
user groups, and many Apple comput- 
er clubs have club libraries of such pro- 
grams. Also, the Apple Avocation Al- 
liance (AAA) of Cheyenne, Wyoming, 
distributes many such programs on its 
nominally priced Pascal disk. The twelve 
disks with Pascal programs from AAA 
include many printout programs, some 
with special features designed for use 
with particular printers such as the IDS 
Paper Tiger, the Diablo 1620, and the Ep- 
son MX-80. The public domain printout 
programs are not supported by any com- 
mercial distributor and cannot be guar- 
anteed. 

Hardware Modifications. There's no 
question that use of the Apple as a word 
processing system with Pascal can be 
more pleasant with certain hardware 
augmentations to the system. Foremost 
among these are jceyboard enhancers 
and eighty-column ckrds. Keyboard en- 
hancers permit the display of both upper 
and lower-case characters on the Apple 
II monitor (see "Apple in Small Letters," 
by Jeff Mazur, October, 1981). These en- 
hancers also provide for optional normal 
shift key operation. That is, there is a 
mode in which depressing the shift key 
causes upper-case characters to be print-

ed, and lower-case characters are print- 
ed on the screen otherwise. This ap- 
proach to text entry is more natural than 
the use of the control-E, control-W, and, 
for those used to tjrpewriters, escape key 
features available for lower-case entry 
without the hardware modification. 

Text editing becomes even more 
straightforward through the use of a Pas- 
cal-compatible eighty-column card (see 
"The New Look with Character," by Jeff 
Mazur, March 1981, and Vision 80, Mar- 
ketalk Reviews, June 1981). Eighty-col- 
umn cards tjrpically provide options for 
normal shift key operation as well, either 
through a connection to the Apple game 
I/O port or through a separate keyboard 
enhancer. Having the full eighty col- 
umns of text available on the screen 
makes a great difference in the ease of 
use of the Pascal word processing sys- 
tem. You see what you'll get without hav- 
ing to toggle back and forth horizontally 
between the two sides of the screen. 

Both the keyboard enhancers and the 
eighty-column cards usually require 
minor modifications to the Apple Pascal 
operating system for all normal functions 
to work properly. Without the modifica- 
tion, some eighty-column cards may dis- 
tort the keypress fvinction and disable the 
tj^eahead buffer. The keyboard and dis- 
play enhancers, used without eighty-col- 
umn boards, require operating system 
modifications to display lower-case char- 
acters in Pascal. Product manufacturers 
can usually provide the text of the brief 



Pascal BIOS modification programs. 
Such programs only need be compiled 
and run once. Once the system boot disk 
is modified, it will provide the full Pascal 
functions thereafter. 

The only other procedure you must 
follow is to execute Setup on AppleS: to 
change the screen width to eighty col- 
umns. This change will result in full 
prompt lines in such system components 
as the Filer. 

The use of an eighty-column board 
presents special opportunities and spe- 
cial problems for text editing. For exam- 
ple, because of the limited number of 
keys on the Apple keyboard, characters 
such as square and curly brackets and 
the underscore must be entered with a 
series of keystrokes. 

Rather than entering this series each 
time you need such a character, you can 
use the Pascal Editor's universal re- 
place option. 

Type a simple symbol you're not 
using otherwise every time one of these 
characters occurs ; after completing the 
file, jump to the begfinning of the text and 
do a universal replace of every occur- 
rence of the symbol with the complex 
character. Simple tricks like this enable 
you to use the Editor's features to over- 
come the limitations of the Apple 
keyboard. 

Other hardware enhancements can 
soup up word processing in Apple Pascal 
even more. One user, for example, uses a 
separate terminal, an Ampex Dialogue- 



80, in place of an eighty-column card. The 
terminal interfaces to the Apple with a 
CCS 7710A asynchronous serial card in 
slot 3. The terminal and computer com- 
mimicate at 19,500 baud, a good deal fast- 
er than the speed provided by the eighty- 
column cards. 

This Apple has the Pascal Speed-up 
Kit as well. This is a hardware/software 
combination consisting of the Stellatlon 
Two 6809 coprocessor board for the Ap- 
ple II and Pascal P-Code Interpreter de- 
signed for the 6809. 

The many hardware and software en- 
hancements available to the Pascal word 
processing user provide a range of levels 
of sophistication for word processing sys- 
tems. At the simplest level, you can 
merely set an appropriate word process- 
ing environment in the Editor, enter the 
text, and then use the Filer's transfer op- 
tion to print it out. 

The next level of sophistication is to 
use a formatting printer program or a 
preformatter. Many professional writing 
tasks work very well this way, particu- 
larly if you have an eighty-column card 
and keyboard enhancer. 

Finally, for those who demand the ut- 
most from their word processing tools, a 
variety of hardware enhancements and 
special Pascal word processing pro- 
grams provide high-complexity perfor- 
mance. The flexibility of the Pascal op- 
erating system permits a natural pro- 
gression through these stages as your 
needs evolve.

lllllllllllllllllllllllll 



Following the lead we established at the beginning of the 
new year, this month's column will continue to examine the 
CP/M utilities by reporting on STAT.COM. STAT stands for 
either statiis or statistical, depending on your preference. It's 
officially used for both. 

Generally speaking, STAT.COM is a utility that allows you 
to display information about the current system configuration 
and to change that configuration when desired. Like PIP.COM, 
STAT.COM is a transient command; that is, typing its name 
causes it to load and execute, performing a function in the 
same way that typing one of the built in commands, such as 
DIR, performs a function. 

STAT may be initiated by typing one of the following forms 
of command: 

STAT[RETURN] 

STAT "command line"[RETURNl 

As in PIP.COM, the command line can take a variety of 
forms; we will examine these as appropriate. 

Typically, the new CP/M user will seldom have discovered 
uses for STAT beyond its simplest form, which is to determine 
the amount of free space left on a particular diskette in a par- 
ticular system disk drive. Typing STAT in the first form above 
will perform that function for the disk in the currently logged 
drive. The response will be in the following form: 

A: R/W, SPACE: xxxK 

If other system drives have been accessed recently, they will 
also be shown. If not, adding a command line that consists only 
of a drive specifier followed by a colon, for example, B:, will 
perform the same function for drive B:. 

In the example, the SPACE: xxxK (where xxx is the 
amount of free space in kilobytes remaining on the disk) was 
expected. "But," you may be asking, "what is the R/W in that 
response ?y STAT has just informed you that the disk is cur- 
rently in Read/Write mode, and therefore can be written to 
by saving files, writing files from Basic, and so on. The exis- 
tence of R/W implies an R/O mode for Read/Only as well, 
which does, of course, exist. We will talk about these, and 
about the methods of setting them, later in the column. For 
now we'll continue to examine the ways STAT reports on disk- 
ette status. 

In addition to determining the free space and Read/Write 
status of the diskette, STAT can also tell us something about 
the files that reside on the diskette. Entering STAT with a com- 
mand line that consists of a file specifier will cause STAT to 
display the status of and statistics on the file requested before 
reporting the total diskette status it gave us before. Both un- 
ambiguous and ambiguous file specifiers may be used, so ♦.*, 
*.BAS, and 7BASIC.COM are all valid forms. For a sample 
diskette with three files, the command and response would 
look like this: 

STAT B:*,*(RETURNj 



Recs Bytes Ext Acc 

8 IK 1 R/O (B:COPY,COM) 
52 7K 1 R/O B:ED.COM 
214 27K 2 R/W B:SORT.BAS 
Bytes remaining on B: 91 K 

In this example, the first three colums relating to the files 
shown all display statistics about the file named in column 
five, while the fourth column reports whether that particular 
file can be written to or not. Now we'll examine each column to 
see what exactly it tells us about the files in question. 

You'll recall from our column on file structure that the 
minimum amount of disk space Apple CP/M can allocate to a 
given file is one kilobyte. The bytes column, therefore, will 
never show a number containing only part of a kilobyte, even 
though the actual file may not be as large as the number 
shown. In effect, then, this column represents the number of 
kilobs^tes allocated to the file rather than the number of kilo- 
bytes the file occupies. For the files shown, one, seven, and 
twenty-seven kilobytes respectively have been allocated on the 
diskette. Since a standard Apple CP/M diskette contains 126K 
of usable space, we can see that the 35K allocated to the files, 
along with the 91K shown in the last line as free space, to- 
gether equal the entire usable space on the disk. 

In our discussion of file structure we also talked about the 
concept of extents and the fact that files are allocated not only 
in numbers of kilobytes but in numbers of 16K blocks as well. 
Each of these 16K blocks is called an extent. The ext column 
displays the number of extents allocated to the file and will cor- 
respond to the number of times sixteen can be divided into the 
bytes figure (plus one if there is a remainder) . 

This figure can be used in at least one way. Since each ex- 
tent a file occupies uses up one entry in the space allocated for 
the director on the disk, and since there are only forty-eight 
such entires allowed, knowing if you're getting close to filling 
the directory area is important. Remember, even small ran- 
dom access files can occupy many extents depending on the 
record numbers in use. 

Finally, the recs column displays the number of 128-byte 
records actually in use by the file. This figtire will give you a 
true length of file (with all but random access files of other 
than 128-byte record size). This is so because with the excep- 
tion of random access files, CP/M handles all files in records of 
128 bytes. Therefore, when a file is first saved on disk, whether 
by using PIP.COM, L0AD.COM, SAVE, or whatever, CP/M 
keeps track of the number of records occupied in the last (non- 
full) extent used and writes the number in the directory entry 
for that extent. 

But since random access file records may be other than 128 
bytes in length, a file may have, for example, one six-byte ran- 
dom record in each of ten extents. In such a case, the true 
length of the file is sixty bytes, although STAT will show it as 
having ten 128-byte records in ten extents. The addition of 
another random record with a record number only one great- 
er than the number of an existing record in the file would prob- 
ably produce no change in the information reported by STAT, 
since the new record would just alter six bytes of information 
in what STAT thinks is an existing 128-byte record. With STAT 



FEBRUARY 1982 



there is no way to get a true length of file in bytes for random 
files of other than 128-byte records. 

A fourth statistics column can be obtained with STAT if a 
dollar sign followed by an S, ($S) , is typed at the end of the file 
specifier. The $S must be separated from the file specifier by a 
space. The new column printed will be "size", and will display 
the virtual file size in records. All this means is that the num- 
ber shown under the size heading is the record number of the 
last record existing in the file. This assumes, of course, record 
sizes of 128 b5d;es and that all records are in use. 

For all files except random access data files, the size and 
recs columns will be the same, since records in these files are 
128 bytes long and the file is full. With random access files, 
STAT will take the sum of all used 128-byte records existing in 
all the extents of the file and display it under the recs column, 
just as in our previous example, not counting the "holes" 
where records have not yet been written. For the size column 
however, STAT will find the end-of-file, and calculate the num- 
ber of 128-byte records in use as if all previous records had ac- 
tually been written. By some definitions, this is considered the 
true size of the file. As you can see, the size entry for a random 
file changes only if a new and higher last record is written, 
while the recs entry changes nearly every time a new record is 
added. Our earlier comments concerning records of other than 
128 bytes apply here also. 

Finally, you will notice that in our example C0PY.COM was 
displayed in column five between parentheses, indicating that 
this file has been given the $SYS or system attribute. This is 
best understood by thinking back to our comments on R/W and 
R/0 status. Both of these are considered to be attributes of the 
specific file. 

In the same way, $SYS and $DIR are file attributes as well. 
A file with the DIR attribute will be shown in the director list- 
ing when the DIR command is used, and also may be copied 
freely using PIP in its standard form. On the other hand, files 
with the SYS attribute can be considered as hidden from both 
the DIR command and from PIP as well unless the [R] param- 
eter, (described last month), is used with PIP. The SYS at- 
tribute is often used to hide files from other users of a diskette 
and is usually combined with the R/0 attribute to prevent ac- 
cidental erasure or copy-over with PIP. 

Now that we've discussed attributes, we should talk about 
how to set them. Setting is also done with STAT in the form: 

STAT filename.typ Sattribute 

where $attribute is the attribute you wish the file to have, 
either R/W or R/0, or DIR or SYS. The system will respond 
with: 

filename.typ Set To attribute 

Either unambiguous file specifiers as were shown earlier or 
ambiguous file specifiers may be used with this command. 

In addition to setting a file's write attribute, you can also set 
entire diskettes to R/0 by the command form: 

STAT d:=R/0 

where d: is the drive you wish set. A drive can't be set to R/W 
with STAT, but a simple control-C resets an R/0 status set 
with STAT. Also, hitting any key after getting the R/0 error 
message when trying to write to a disk set with R/0 will clear 
it. There is no analogous attribute to SYS and DIR for entire 
diskettes, although using the *.* ambiguous file reference will 
have that effect by setting all existing files to SYS or DIR as de- 
sired. 

Besides displaying statistics and setting attributes for files, 
STAT also can be used to report the characteristics of the disk 
drives themselves. This is done using the form: 

STAT d:DSK: (where d is the drive identifier) 

Stat will respond with: 

d: Drive Characteristics 
1024: 128 Byte Record Capacity 
128: Kilobyte Drive Capacity 



48: 32 Byte Directory Entries 
48: Checked Directory Entries 
128: Records/ Extent 

8: Records/ Block 
32: Sectors/ Track 

3: Reserved Tracks 

Admittedly, this information will be of limited use to the 
average user; however, it may come in handy when other than 
Apple disk drives are placed on a system. My system, for ex- 
ample, has a five-megabj^te S^^-inch hard disk, a double-sided, 
double-density, eighty track 5^-inch floppy disk drive, two 
standard Apple disk drives and two double-sided, double- 
density 8-inch disk drives. 

Each of these non- Apple drives has a different set of drive 
characteristics that are important to consider when doing disk 
to disk routines. This is especially true of the 8-inch drives, 
which can be set to single or double-sided, or to single or dou- 
ble-density. STAT provides a quick way of determining the 
drive configurations at any given time. This hardware, which 
comes from Lobo Drives International, is part of a growing 
number of drive options for Apple CP/M. We'll try to address 
the question of comparative performance of these periph- 
erals in a future column. 

The next use of STAT concerns the CP/M 2.2 USER func- 
tion. As we discussed briefly in a previous column, the concept 
of USER areas is implemented by simply identifying each file 
entry with the USER number that was in effect when the file 
was saved. While DIR and other commands, (STAT in- 
cluded), will only report the files associated with the current 
USER, STAT can also report what the current USER number 
is and the number of other USER areas that have active files. 
To obtain this information, enter the following: 
STAT USR: 

Assuming of course that you are logged on as USER 0 and have 
files in USER areas 0, 1, 2 and 5, STAT will respond with: 

Active User : 0 
Active Files: 012 5 

The final use for the STAT command is to report on and es- 
tablish device assignments within the system. Of necessity, 
we're going to get rather technical here, but if you hang in 
there and refer to the Softcard manuals or other CP/M docu- 
mentation for clarification, your understanding of general I/O 
in the Apple CP/M environment will be increased. 

As we've touched on before, devices to the CP/M system 
are simply a conceptual part of the system that performs some 
specific function, such as the printer, paper-tape reader, disk, 
and so on. For CP/M 2.2, five functions the system performs 
require interfacing to the physical world. These are: 

CON: - The user's console input and output. 

RDR: - A reader device of some sort, (cards, tape, etc.) 

RUN: - A punch or output device, (as above) 

LST: - The user's printer or listing device. 

d:DSK: - The user's disk drives, (d: is identifier) 

These are all logical devices since, with the exception of the 
disk drives, they correspond to a function rather than to a spe- 
cific physical device. The disk drives can be thought of as both 
physical and logical devices. The other four must somehow be 
linked to a physical device that performs their specific func- 
tion. The system's hnks to these physical devices are routines 
called drivers that are located in the BIOS. Consequently, 
when the system wishes to perform the logical LST: function, 
for example, the output it generates must somehow be direct- 
ed to that driver in the BIOS which directs the operation of the 
actual physical device that you've selected to perform that 
function (probably the system line printer). 

In like manner, the other three functions must be linked to 
the devices you've set up to perform those functions. Obvious- 
ly, the system itself has no need for the names CON:, LST:, 
RDR:, and so on. Such names just make it easier for us hu- 
mans to see what we're manipulating, and so STAT, (just like 
PEP last month) , deals with these devices by their names. In 



reality, the names correspond to vector addresses in the BIOS 
to which output is directed or from which input is obtained. 

Typically, there is one actual driver for each function that 
comes built into a CP/M system and resides in the BIOS itself. 
Other physical devices may be linked in by having their driv- 
ing routines placed elsewhere in protected memory, and then 
altering their vector addresses to point to those routines. These 
link vectors are also named as physical devices for use with 
STAT, PIP, and other commands. 

The twelve physical devices and the logical devices they 
can be linked to are displayed by typing the command: 

STAT VAL: 

This command will produce a summary of the various STAT 
command forms we discussed earlier, plus a table under the 
heading- 

lobyte Assign: 

CON: - TTY: CRT: BAT; UCl: 
RDR: - TTY: PTR: URl: UR2: 
PUN: - TTY: PTP: UPl: UP2: 
LST: - TTY: CRT: LPT: ULl: 

In an earlier time, these names actually had some basis in 
fact. PTR and PTP actually stood for paper tape reader and 
paper tape punch respectively, TTY was the common teletype 
typewriter style keyboard, and so on. Now, however, these 
names are commonly used to stand for just about anything 
that is consistent with the basic function, i.e. input or output. 
You can't, for example, output to a PTR or URl device, and 
likewise can't input from an LPT or UPl device. So long as the 
basic input and output functions are consistent, though, nearly 
any physical device can be assigned to any logical device. 

We can find out what our current device assignments are 
by typing the following command: 

STAT DEV: 



If your CP/M is unaltered, it will produce the following Ust: 

CON: is CRT: 
RDR: is PTR: 
PUN: is PTP: 
LST: is LPT: 

This list tells us that the logical device CON: , meaning con- 
sole, is linked to the physical device CRT: ; the logical RDR: to 
the physical PTR:, and so on. Remember that these physical 
devices are nothing more than vectors that point to a specific 
driver routine in memory that is itself designed to control 
drive, the physical device. Each of the twelve physical devices 
is associated with a particular vector. CP/M keeps track of the 
assignment of logical to physical devices by means of a single 
byte of memory called the lobyte. The lobyte is found at mem- 
ory location 0003, and its eight bits are assigned, two to each of 
the logical devices, as shown here: 



lOBYTE at 0003 


LST: 


PUN: 


RDR: 


CON: 


bit number 


7 6 


5 4 


3 2 


1 0 


standard value 


1 0 


0 1 


0 1 


0 1 



Since four values— 0, 1, 2, and 3— can all be represented in 
just two binary bits (00, 01, 10, and 11 respectively), each sec- 
tion of the lobyte can be set to four values that correspond to 
the four possible physical devices that can be assigned to that 
logical device. The possible values for each logical device are : 

CON: (bitsO&l); 0-TTY:, l-CRT:, 2-BAT:, 3-UCl: 

RDR: (bits 2 & 3); 0-TTY:, 1-PTR:, 2-JR:, 3-UR2: 

PUN: (bits 4 & 5); 0-TTY:, 1-PTP:, 2-JP:, 3-UP2: 

LST: (bits6&7); 0-TTY:, 1-CRT:, 2-LPT:, 3-UL1: 

So, by altering the bits in the lobjrte, we are able to change 
the physical device (remember these are only vectors to a 
driver for the physical device) that is assigned to the system's 
logical device or function. In this way, by knowing which physi- 
cal devices (vectors and drivers) correspond to which hard- 
ware peripheral cards in your system, you can have maxi- 
mum flexibility in the assignment of functions to specific 
peripherals. When you type [CTRL]-[P] from CP/M or LPRINT 
from BASIC, for instance, depending on your current device 
assignments, the hard copy output will be directed to the prop- 
er peripheral device no matter how many printers you have in 
your system. The same holds true for all the other logical and 
physical devices. Changing the lobyte by hand for each sys- 
tem configuration, however, would be asking a bit much, and 
that's where the device assignment function of STAT comes in. 
By typing: 

STAT logical device: = physical device; 

we cause STAT to alter the lobyte to the new configuration. 
STAT will respond with: 

logical device: is physical device: 

Apple CP/M does contain some limitations that must be 
considered in device assignments. Unlike the normal hard- 
ware that CP/M runs on, the Apple is set up to interface to the 
outside world through something called memory mapped I/O. 
Under this system, each peripheral slot is assigned a certain 
segment of memory addresses that, in reality, are not RAM at 
all, but are space that can be used for routines contained in 
ROM on the peripheral card in question. To the Apple, these 
ROM routines look like any other ROM or RAM routines in its 
memory range. Consequently, most Apple peripherals are 
built with such structure in mind and contain ROM routines 
that drive the peripheral — outputting characters, inputting 
characters, and so on — in a semi-standardized manner. 

Because of this, when Microsoft designed the BIOS for Soft- 
card, they had to establish a system of physical devices (vec- 
tors, remember?) that took into account the fact that this 
would possibly mean calling a 6502 subroutine in ROM located 
on a peripheral card in one of the six Apple slots. Where possi- 
ble, to save time switching back and forth from 6502 mode to Z-

80, calling such ROM routines was rejected in favor of dealing 
directly with the I/O circuitry on the card. In either case, how- 
ever, allowing complete freedom in the placement of such 
cards among the six slots would have meant requiring the user 
to rewrite portions of the BIOS each time such reconfiguration 
took place. While this might have been acceptable to some so- 
phisticated users, most users would not have been able to per- 
form such config^iration alone. For that reason, Microsoft 
made the decision that lead to the current configuration, in 
which the physical devices are confined to specific slots. The 
LPT: (line printer), device, for example, is confined to slot 
one; the PTR: and FTP: (reader and punch) devices to slot 
two and so on. General purpose drivers for these devices that 
would take care of most standard Apple peripherals placed in 
the corresponding slots were installed in the BIOS. 

The inherent structure of the Apple II hardware dictated 
that all twelve physical devices be implemented using just ten 
vectors. These vectors are two bytes in memory that contain 
an address of one of the general purpose driver routines in the 
BIOS. A simplified example of the process will help you under- 
stand how it works. 

If the system wishes to output a character to the logical 
LST: device, it places the character in Z-80 register [C] and 
then examines the lobyte to see which physical device is cur- 
rently assigned to do that output. Finding that the physical 
LPT: device is the proper one, it consults a table and learns 
that the vector used by LPT: is List Output Vector #1, located 
at F392 and F393. The two bytes at these addresses are them- 
selves an address that is the starting address for the printer 
driver located in the BIOS. The system now goes to that start- 
ing address and executes the driver routine controlling the in- 
terface card in slot 1, and a character is printed on the printer. 

Simply stated, each logical device is assigned (by you) , to a 
specific physical device, each physical device is assigfned to a 
specific vector, each vector points to a specific driver routine, 
and each driver routine controls a specific slot. The table sum- 
marizes these assignments.

Apple CP/M comes configxired with drivers in the BIOS for 
a printer interface in slot one, general purpose I/O in slot two, 
general console I/O, (either an 80-column card or an I/O card 
connected to a terminal), in slot three, and disk controller 
cards in slots four, five, and six. Slot seven is undefined, as are 
slots four and five if they contain no disk controllers. If the pe- 
ripheral card in a specified slot is one that CP/M recognizes 
(which includes most cards distributed by Apple Inc., plus a 
variety of printer, serial, and eighty-column cards), the 
drivers in the BIOS will initialize the card and direct input 
from it and output to it in a way the card expects. 

With the exception of the LST: logical device, these drivers 
can generally recover well if accessed with no card in the slot. 
With no card installed in slot two, for example, output to the 
PUN: logical device will have no noticeable effect; likewise, 
attempted input from the RDR: device will always return an 
end-of-file character. Since it was foreseen that there would be 
other non-recognized cards for which the standard driver 
would not work, patch areas were set aside in the BIOS in 
which a user could place his own driver for such a card. 

This brings us to our subject for next month; the CON- 
FIGIO utility, which, coincidentally, has as one of its functions 
the ability to install driver routines for unrecog^zed cards, 
and to enhance the driver routines already in the BIOS. 
Until next month. ...

An Apple with synthesizer hooked up to a special platform enables Charlene Brown, who is totally deaf, to "hear" the music through the vi- 
brations in her feet. Brown is shown dancing to music being played on the Apple by Harold Martindale, who's legally blind, and from the look 
of the picture, they're both getting into the beat. Opposite page, from the top: Jean Miller, Jack's dad, says his son and Dale Washlake act as 
a catalyst for each other. Washlake wrote a program that enables Jack to work at his Apple for long periods of time.

FEBRUARY 1982

BY MELISSA hILlCU 




Roy Bonnell and his colleagues at Florida State University 
in Tallahassee have given music to twenty-nine-year-old Char- 
lene Brown who has been deaf since birth. A vibrating plat- 
form hooked to a musically programmed microcomputer en- 
ables Brown, who loves disco dancing, to feel the music and 
dance to the beat she "hears" through her feet. Bonnell plans 
to expand his vibrating platform into an entire studio that 
would enable deaf students to major in dance at Florida State 
if they chose. 

Thanks to computer software developed by Gary Kelly and 
David Ross of Georgia Tech in Atlanta, blind people can now 
learn to read using a tonal alphabet that substitutes musical 
tones for letters and numbers. Kelly, who is himself visually im- 
paired, says those who learn his musical language will be able 
to read the musical version of English at approximately three 
hundred words a minute — a reading speed three times as fast as 
the average braille reader and a speed nearly equal to the av- 
erage sighted reader. 

In Rancho Palos Verdes, California, Jack Miller, a high 
school senior suffering from muscular dystrophy, lacked the 
strength and agility in his fingers to use his Apple keyboard to 
learn programming. Fortunately, Miller had an innovative 
computer teacher. Dale Washlake, who wrote a program al- 
lowing his young student to control the keyboard by turning the 
knob on a game paddle. 

The computer software that gets the most press attention 
these days does not usually include programs that are de- 
veloped for the handicapped. There's always a lot of hoopla 
that goes along with each new arcade or adventure game re- 
lease. But there is also a large amount of excitement brewing 
among a more quiet group of people who are just as actively 
developing computer applications that will make life easier for 
those without fully functional bodies.

This is not to shortchange the value of computer games. 
Their value has already been proven in several aspects of ther- 
apy, from helping stroke victims develop coordination to 
teaching children with behavioral problems how to concen- 
trate. And, as Jack Miller will attest, it was the skill he devel- 
oped manipulating the game paddles playing Raster Blaster 
over and over that enabled him to adapt so successfully to 
Washlake's alternative to the keyboard. 

The programmers, Roy Bonnell, Gary Kelly, and Dale 
Washlake, are not getting rich off their software programs or 
computer applications, but they are getting different kinds of 
rewards. The look on Charlene Brown's face the first time she 
hopped on the vibrating platform to "hear" the music through 
her feet was worth a million dollars to those who built the con- 
traption at Florida State. 

Brown, who loves dancing, always went to discos regular- 
ly, but since she is totally deaf, she had to keep time to the 
flashing lights and by the movements of the other dancers. 
Brown was one of the first to test the invention that was 
created jointly by Bonnell, a career counselor, and Barry Mc- 
Connell, a computer programmer. 

The vibrating platform that allows Brown to dance to a beat 
she can feel is actually an artificial floor that contains sound 
transducers. The transducers, which are manufactured by a 
private company, weigh only about two pounds and can fit into 
the palm of an average-sized hand. A voice coil and a large 
magnet inside turn sounds into physical vibrations. 

Bonnell installed several of these sound transducers into a 
platform that's connected to an Apple computer with a music 
synthesizer inside. The result was the vibrating platform. 

Brown's eyes radiated excitement with her first steps as 
she felt the music coming through the floor. 

"Oh, if you could have seen her, it was so great," recalls 
Bonnell. "TTiere's a feeling component to music that's very im- 
portant. The only time people usually experience this is If they 



are sitting in the front row before a huge orchestra. 

"Even if they're not deaf, it's fun to watch people get up on 
this platform. A lot of people just like to sit on it." 

Bonnell, who is systems coordinator for the university's 
career development services, also installed near the plat- 
form variably colored strobe lights that change with the 
rhythms of the music. Eventually, he would like to open an en- 
tire dance theatre built on a vibrating floor with rhythmically 
changing lights that could accommodate deaf students who 
want to major in dance. 

"We are searching for ways to provide to the handicapped 
things that most fully fiinctional people take for granted," Bon- 
nell said. "We try to do this by finding things that are already 
available and putting them together in unique ways." 

Gary Kelly, a graduate student at Georgia Tech Univer- 
sity, shares that philosophy. On an Apple, he has developed a 
unique reading system for the visually impaired in which mu- 
sical sounds have been assigned to normal English text. His 
language is reminiscent of the sounds of R2D2 of Star Wars. 
The software was written in machine language with all the 
tones corresponding to the ASCII characters. The carriage re- 
turn, control assignment, and space bar all have tones as- 
signed to them. 

That's kind of unique all by itself, but what makes Kelly's 
innovation even more unusual is that his musical translation 
from English was so carefully engineered that proper English 
typed on a keyboard will come out of the computer via the syn- 
thesizer as a melody — sometimes even a recognizable one. 
Garbled spelling or garbled typing will come out as garbled 
music. 

For example, the phrase this is is a. very common expres- 
sion in conversational computer language (this is an Apple II, 
and 80 on) . The six letters in the phraae this is correspond to the 
first six notes in Scott Joplin's melody, "The Entertainer." 
Kelly, who has a background in psychology and human fac-

Piofessionol proofreading 

on the APPLE II Computer 
Is how o reolity 




THE APPLE SPELLER fills the void 
that has consistently kept the large 
variety of excellent word processing 
packages for the Apple II Computer 
from approaching the power of a 
dedicated work processor. Finally, 
the first professional quality spelling 
verification program is available for 
the Apple II. The Apple Speller will 
certainly be the standard against 
which all other similar programs are 
compared. 

The Apple Speller interfaces to the 
most popular Apple word processors, 
including Applewriter, Apple Pie, 
Executive Secretary, Letter Perfect, 
Magic Window, and Superscribe II, 
just to name a few. In fact. The Apple 
Speller can analyze the output of any 
editor that writes a standard Apple 
binary or text file to a diskette. In 
addition to this flexibility, the per- 
formance of The Apple Speller will 
astound the microcomputer world. 

The Apple Speller is supplied with 
a 30,000+ word dictionary on a 
single SV^" diskette with additional 
space to easily add another 8,000 
words to suit your individual needs. 

APPLE IS a registered trademark of APPLE Computer Company 



The Apple Speller has built-in utilities 
to maintain the dictionary diskette. 
You can readily add words, delete 
words, and create an unlimited num- 
ber of modified and/or new diction- 
aries for specific application. 

The Apple Speller is unbelievably 
fast. The first pass reads your docu- 
ment and collects all the words it 
contains at a rate of 5,000 words 
per minute. Next, the words are 
compared to the dictionary for spell- 
ing errors at the incredible speed of 
50,000 words per minute. Finally, all 
misspelled words are marked as 
such in your document with a rate 
of 1,000 words per minute. This 
translates to proofreading a 10 page 
document in 1 minute if there are no 
spelling mistakes and 2 minutes, 15 
seconds for an unlimited number of 
spelling errors. 

Numerous options are provided 
throughout the program to enable 
you to completely control all activi- 
ties of The Apple Speller. These 
include the ability to ignore both 
control codes and formatting com- 
mands, an alphabetical listing of 



either mispelled words or all the 
words in your document along with 
usage frequencies, multiple options 
for the action taken with each 
misspelled word, and much, much 
more! A verification mode is pro- 
vided to allow you to examine and 
dispense with misspelled words 
while viewing them in the actual 
context in which they appeared in 
your file. 

The Apple Speller requires an 
Apple ll/Apple II + equipped with 48K, 
DOS 3.3, and 1 or 2 disk drives. Two 
disk drives are required to delete or 
add words to the dictionary. 

The Apple Speller is being intro-

tors engineering, and not in music, aaya he paired the letters of 
the alphabet to the musical notes by way of a mathematical 
formula. The research, which was funded by the Veteran's Ad- 
ministration, first required Kelly to compile a list of the most 
frequently used letter sequences in the English language. 

To do this, he used the same types of technical literature the 
FBI, CIA, and other special agencies use to crack codes. Kelly 
says the English language is very redundant, and his final list 
numbered only about three hundred combinations. 

"The letters QU occur quite often," he explained. "You 
never find QB in this language. TH also occurs a tremen- 
dous amount, but TJ almost never." 

The list of letters was ranked according to the frequency 
with which they occur in our language. Then, by coincidence, a 
visually impaired musician Joined the project. He was able to 
compile a similar list — this time of the most commonly occur- 
ring musical sequences in Western culture. 

Kelly found that musical sequences in the Western culture 
are almost as redundant as our language letter combinations. 
For example, the Jumps in musical notes C to D to E occurs 
fairly often in popular songs, whereas the sequence of jumps 
from notes A to B-flat to C-sharp isn't a very logical musical se- 
quence to most Americans, although that combination of 
sounds might sound just fine in a different culture. 

Kelly says he tried to mesh the two lists together as logical- 
ly as possible, but he naturally found some words that didn't 
come across as very musical. Words with a foreign spelling or 
an odd combination of letters that doesn't occur very often in 
English are slightly out of tune with the rest of the sentence In 
Kelly's musical language. 

Kelly is now modifying Apple Writer to his tonal alphabet to 
provide a word processing system that the blind can use that 
he believes is more foolproof than the braille system. Typing 
mistakes will come across as a clash of sounds with the tonal 
alphabet. 



59 

Although still in the testing stages with only a small num- 
ber of people using the system, Kelly believes the tonal alpha- 
bet is easier to learn than braille. After twenty hours of study, 
one user was able to translate or read one hundred words a 
minute. Eventually, the more well- versed users should be able 
to decipher about three hundred words a minute. 

For added simplicity, punctuation marks were given com- 
pletely different sounds — ^tritones or chords — to make a dis- 
tinct sound from the alphabet and number tones. "The excla- 
mation mark is a high-pitched shriek— it sounds like an excla- 
mation mark. The period is a very low clump, and that sounds 
like it should be at the end of a sentence." 

In addition, Kelly says his musical alphabet Is also much 
more interesting and far less expensive than a braille system. 
Braille readers need a special machine to type and print, as 
well as special paper. Not many employers, Kelly believes, are 
willing to go to this extra expense to employ a blind persdn. 

But, if the employer has an Apple computer, the only other 
thing that's required to use the tonal alphabet system is a mu- 
sic card. The software Kelly will supply free in exchange for a 
floppy disk on which to copy the program. 

'The only question people keep asking Kelly is, why should a 
person put so much energ^y into learning the tonal alphabet if 
there are computer-controlled tape recorded voice output de- 
vices now available for handicapped use? 

"There are about two million visually Impaired people in 
this country and their biggest problem is illiteracy. "There are 
too many voice devices that free people way too much from 
ever having to use the language. 

"They're gradually forgetting grammar, spelling, punctua- 
tion, and sentence structure. But these basic communication 
skills are needed by everybody whether they're employed by a 
company that needs a report prepared or they Just want to 
write a letter to a friend." 

Kelly sees the possibility of some fluent listeners of his Ian- 



Consider the classroom of the future.^ 



To meet the demands of an increasingly complex world, tlie classroom will become a "Learning Environment" which 
coordinates space, work surfaces, group and private interaction, audio/visual presentations, printed material, and electronic

Why Computer Mediated Instruction? The microcomputer personalizes learning; 
it frames learning within an individualized situation. It combines vital immediate 
feedback with infinite'patience. Its screen displays capture attention, while the 
learner advances at his or her own pace.

guage being able to translate an already existing piece of mu- 
sic such as Beethoven's Fifth and possibly discovering an in- 
terpretation new to music scholars. In the meantime he is sat- 
isfied for having developed something that is, in effect, an art 
form, which he describes as "musical poetry." 

Both the tonal alphabet and the vibrating platform were 
created using standard pieces of hardware and inexpensive 
parts that were already on the market. Imagination also came 
in handy. Dale Washlake got the idea for an alternative to the 
computer keyboard while driving down the freeway, and all he 
needed after that was a game paddle and a little perseverance. 

Washlake, who lives in southern California, is a private 
teacher of computer programming to eighteen-year-old Jack 
Miller, a victim of muscular dystrophy. Not only did Jack have 
problems pressing the keyboard, but he was also having trou- 
ble sitting up straight in a chair for long periods of time to work 
at his Apple. 

An attachable RCA heat sensitive keyboard that hooks to 
the Apple was first brought in to solve the problem. Although 
no pressure is required to use the keyboard, agility was still a 
problem for Jack, especially when he had to press two keys at 
the same time in order to give control commands. So one night, 
after struggling with the Los Angeles freeways, Washlake went 
home and struggled with a program to eliminate the problem 
by giving a game paddle the control of a keyboard. 

Washlake wrote a program in machine language that 
would scroll the letters, numbers, and characters of the entire 
computer keyboard across the top of the video screen. When it 
reaches the end of the sequence, the line backs up and runs by 
again. Turning the game paddle knob in any direction adjusts 
the speed at which the letters and symbols scroll by. To stop 
the scroll of letters at the chosen character. Jack simply twists 
the knob slightly toward the center. 

To print the character on the screen. Jack presses the but- 
ton on the paddle, which is large enough for him to work easi- 
ly. The paddle also allows Jack to program from a reclining 



position. Washlake was careful to design the paddle program- 
ming so that its mechanics did not interfere with the program 
already created on the screen that the paddle program is for- 
matting. 

Washlake says when he figged out exactly what Jack 
needed, he contacted people all over the country to try to find 
an already-existing program that would utilize the game pad- 
dles in this way. But although Washlake thought it a very obvi- 
ous solution, he couldn't find anybody who had already written 
the sort of program he had in mind. 

The program, which he calls Paddle Keyboard II, was writ- 
ten on Lisa and several days were spent revising it. Washlake 
calls it the II because the first version, in which every position 
on the paddle knob corresponded to a letter, was just too hard 
for Jack, or any user, to work. The new version, which takes 
just minutes to learn, is extremely adaptable to the average 
user. It takes less time to learn if you've had a lot of arcade 
game practice with paddles. 

Although Washlake doesn't have a publisher for his pro- 
gram, he wants to make it commercially available to as many 
people as possible. 

"The only way for Jack to learn programming was for him 
to do it. I wanted to provide a way to encourage him to do it as 
long as possible." 

Washlake, Kelly, and Bonnell. Three Apple users in three 
different parts of the country, all who turn their ideas into 
something that will help somebody in some way. And they 
keep going. At Florida State, Bonnell is also helping to develop 
software and other applications for the visually impaired, in- 
cluding a braille printer they can produce at a fraction of the 
cost of the standard model. Georgia Tech's Kelly has his hands 
in at least ten other projects he promises are as intriguing as 
the tonal alphabet, and, in California, Washlake, with the help 
of Jack Miller, is developing a computer game. A few good 
ideas and the right people and life for the handicapped ad- 
vances along with the rest of society. JM

Write - On 



A computer without a word processing program is only 
being half-utilized. And the unused half is the most important, 
because we all have reams of letters to write, scripts to type, text 
to edit, files to keep and data to record. 

Write-On! was developed to solve all these problems, 
and more, for you . . .easily, quickly, and effortlessly. Have 

we succeeded? 
In the june 81 
issue of Byte 
magazine, they 
'^'"^ reviewed Write- 
On! against the competition. And here are just some of the nice 
things they had to say. 

"Write-On! is amazingly error-free and it ran the first 
time we put it on the computer. One of us thinks it's his choice 
of all the word processors that we reviewed." "Write-On! is a 
super word processor. . . .touch typists can enter text quickly 
and easily. . . . performs its editing chores with ease and speed 
. . .even provides for form letters using data files. This is a 
tremendously powerful and useful feature (especially for the 
price).'' 

To continue with words from Byte, "Along with excellent 
human engineering, Write-On! provides superlative docu- 
mentation. . . . leads the user by the hand. . .explanations are 
clear and concise. . And. . . " . . .undoubtedly the most 
powerful features found in a microcomputer-based word 
processor." 

Our users have been sayingthesame kind of things about 
Write-On! The reason, we believe, is because of all the word- 
processors available, this one was designed to be user-oriented 
. . .to be easy for non-computer types to get professional results 
with. Whether used for business, professional, home or school 
. . .Write-On! is the right one because it is right-on.

The 
Softalk Cruise 
Leaves June 5th! 



A week can be a long time and seven days is what you get on the Softalk cruise. For seven 
days you con get away from the daily grind, shake off the chill of winter, thrill to spectacular 
scenery, and, most importantly, learn more about your Apple computer. 

You and your Apple are invited to take part in a great adventure that will present a chal- 
lenging curriculum in a relaxing environment. The time is rapidly approaching — the cruise de- 
parts June 5, 1 982 and reservations ore due before March 1 . The place is the magnificent Pa- 
cific Northwest, seen from the land and from the deck of the luxurious Sun Princess. 

Beginning in Vancouver, British Columbia, the Softalk cruise will visit the ports of Juneau, 
Skagway, and Ketchikan. It will also explore the wonders of Glacier Bay and Misty Fjord, re- 
turning to Vancouver at the end of a week. During the cruise there will be several seminars of- 
fering Apple owners and their computers the opportunity to learn from the masters. 

Ken Williams, creator of hi-res adventures and other mischiefs, will illustrate sophisticated 
graphics techniques. Roger Wagner, bestselling author of Softalk's Assembly Lines column 
and a crooner of some renown in the San Diego area, will investigate advanced assembly 
language programming. Dennis Goodrow, co-author of Expediter II, the bestselling Apple- 
soft compiler, will enlighten Basic programmers on the uses and abuses of compilers. 

The latest addition to this list of all-stars is Mark Pelczarski, author of the popular Complete 
Graphics System and Special Effects. He'll delve into the mysteries of basic and instruct those 
present on how to program their own database. 

You can meet all these people, see some of the most beautiful scenery north of Silicon Gulch, 
learn more about your computer, and escape from the daily grind all at the same time. 
Sound great? 

If it does, you better move fast because time is running out. You've only got a month to sign 
on, so the time for action is now. Please write for the necessary information and cost of the

Empire I: World Builders. By David Mullich. Not enough peo- 
ple seem to know that good science fiction has very little to do 
with gorgeous unclad women and fierce snarling monsters. 
Thankfully, David Mullich is a man who knows science fiction 
and this makes Empire I an interesting, thinking person's ad- 
venture game. 

The game requires a lot of time and patience. In it, you 
create characters and watch them die with great rapidity. But 
you are always the master of your own fate, and you survive if 
you are smart. 

The game begins at the New York Rocket Field where you 
are given the choice of plajdng an old character or creating a 
new one. The computer helps you randomly select the sex and 
characteristics of your player, which determine how she or he 
will fare in the trials and tribulations to come. You're given the 
choice of three career paths to follow: homesteader, miner, or 
missionary. 

Once you've got your character, you board a spaceship 
which leaves earth for an interstellar voyage. Soon you find 
yourself orbiting a planet that has specific characteristics. 
Some planets are better than others, depending on what ca- 
reer you have chosen. Homesteaders have to find a planet with 
an earthlike atmosphere and some kind of government or 
chances are they won't survive for long. Missionaries need a 
planet with a population of some kind, since their primary pur- 
pose in life is to preach to someone. Miners are best served on 
planets that have a high density, since they are in search of 
mineral wealth. 

This is definitely a game in which you must use your head. 
For instance, leaving a spaceship without your vacsult on a 
planet that has an unbreathable atmosphere will cause your 
character to die painfully. Missionaries have to gauge the ef- 
fect of their preaching on the masses or risk being stoned to 
death. Miners must be aware of their equipment (which could 
fail at any time) and of the local environment. 

Homesteaders have perhaps the toughest time of all. They 
have to monitor crops, rainfall, and herds of heffelumps; they 
even have to get married and raise a family to keep from get- 
ting lonely. One of the highpoints in the game occurs when the 
homesteader mates with her or his spouse (accomplished by 
typing in "mate"). The computer determines if you had 
enough will power and whether any offspring resulted. 

Empire I strives for reality whenever possible. You have to 
eat and drink when you are on a planet's surface. The longer 
you play the game with one character, the older you get. Even- 
tually, a character will die of old age or be so worn out as to be 
useless. If you choose to quit before your character dies, he or 
she is saved on the disk for the next player. 

Mullich has fashioned an elaborate history to explain the 
background of Empire I and to lay the groundwork for the two 
games to follow in this Interactive Fantasies series. Although 
it is not essential to read this history for purposes of playing the 
game, it is worthwhile and good science fiction. 

Empire I is played, like any good adventure, using an elab- 
orate vocabulary, including fix, repair, undress, steal, bribe, 
stab, chop, fling, and preach. You start with an inventory of 
possessions and you're given ample opportunities to buy 
needed goods in the course of the game. 



You also interact with other characters in the course of the 
game, some friendly and some not. One nod to the less than 
serious aspects of science fiction is the Bandersnatches, fe- 
rocious, bipedal carnivores that invariably tear your char- 
acter limb from limb. 

On the whole, though, this is an adventure that goes out of 
its way to be interesting and evocative of the future potential 
for man's colonizing of the galaxy. W

Zoom Grafix. By Dav Holle. If your printer can tap out graph- 
ics, Zoom Grafix may be for you. It will operate on any of the 
following machines: All IDS and Epson printers, the AO'1 88G, 
NEC 8023A, Xerox, Pro-Writer, Spinwriter, Qume, Anadex, 
Diablo, Silentype, and Starwriter. 

Zoom Grafix will show you a picture on the screen to let 
you decide if that is indeed the one you want printed out. You 
can also swap hi-res screens. If neither of the screens in mem- 
ory is the one you want, you can ask for a file from the disk 
(getting a catalog by hitting return) . 

Once you've selected your file, you can print either a posi- 
tive or negative image, vertically or horizontally. 

You can change the size by changing proportions. Normal- 
ly, you would print one dot high by one dot wide ; to double the 
size, you'd select two by two, or triple it by selecting three by 
three, and so on. For special effects, you could choose one high 
by two wide, or vice versa. 

The zoom feature of Zoom Grafix lets you select any part of 
the picture by its outside row and column coordinates, then 
print it out to any size. Once you've set the dimensions at top 
and bottom, left and right, a frame will show around the 
chosen section. (If it isn't correct, you can change your dimen- 
sions.) 

Note : you have to pay attention to the delay settings when 
you do this. If you have large areas of black to print out, you 
could damage your printer unless you let it cool periodically. 
Choosing number 7 on the menu lets you change the delay fig- 
ure at the end of each row. 

You can also set your left margin, change print width (au- 
tomatically set according to your printer) , and send a form or 
line feed command. 

The error-trapping features on the progfram work quite 
well. You always seem to have an option to change your mind, 
as well, and that's very helpful. DA

Napoleon's Campaigns: 1813 & 181S. By Paul Murray (design 
and programming), Joel Billings and Larry Duffleld (game 
development) . Strategy games on the Apple have always been 
much of a sameness. You enter all your orders, your opponent 
enters all of his or her orders, and the computer carries all the 
orders out at the same time. This is well and good, if you're 
playing something as precise as a game. 

But real life is different. Things don't happen that way at 
all. Consider Benjamin Franklin's "For want of a nail" 
maxim, in which the lack of a nail results in horseshoe, horse, 
6uid rider all being lost. 

In a real battle, orders can be delayed or lost. They can be 
misinterpreted. They can be followed timidly. In some cases, 
they may even be disobeyed. And the person in charge of the 
battle, no matter how competent, can't be everywhere at all 
times. 

Until a few years ago, commimication was accomplished 
via messenger. Even today in modem warfare, much of 
communication is handled the same way. After all, codes can 
be broken, radio transmissions can be jammed, electronic 
gear can be damaged. The fog of war that veils events from a 
commander's view is in effect just as much now as it was mil- 
lennia ago. 

Strategic Simulations places these factors in the fore- 
front of its Napoleon's Campaigns. In this game, the player or 
players command corps of troops at either Waterloo or Leip- 
zig. To avoid delays, the line of communication (LOC) must be 
kept open. The farther away a corps is from the headquarters, 
the longer it takes to respond to orders. 

To replace subordinates' misinterpretation, the game 
counters with leadership ratings, with the tactical ability of 
corps commanders ranging from one to nine. Timidity is re- 
flected by the aggressiveness rating of a commander, with 
negative and positive ratings possible. A corps may become so 
fatigued it's demoralized, giving it such low morale that it 
won't obey the army commander. 

Corps are numbered according to their marching priority. 
Since the Allies (English, Prussians, and so on) are unwieldy, 
these corps are designated arbitrarily. Starting urgency and 
starting contact are also set at the beginning of the game. 

Urgency determines how effective a corps will be. Starting 
contact modes range from initiative, withdraw, stand, and at- 
tack, to hasty attack. This lets you determine what a corps will 
do when it enters an enemy zone of control. 

The sequence of play begfins with a reconnaissance, as 
corps check the hexes they occupy and those immediately 
around them. Those in patrol mode check two hexes around 
them. 

You next receive activity reports — some of which may be 
false, others which may reflect movement of your own troops. 

Then come battle reports, with time, friendly units in- 
volved, battle location information, and so on. These are fol- 
lowed by reconnaissance reports. Units show the time sent, 
from where, which corps is sending the report, and an esti- 
mate of enemy strength (which can be inflated or minimized) . 

Last to arrive are location reports. In which each corps able 
to report tells when its report was sent, from what hex, and 
sometimes what combat action is planned. 

After all reports are in, the commander can issue orders. 
These can be from three menus: strategfic orders, orders to 
corps, and orders to a group of corps operating as a force un- 
der the immediate command of the primary army com- 
mander. 

Strategic orders don't go to the corps; instead they show 
you what's happening. You look at an attractive map (coincid- 
ing with the maps and cardboard counters supplied with the 
game) and at status reports. As army commander you can 
also designate a secondary army commander, reset LOC, save 
the game, reread the earlier dispatches, or order a corps or 
force. 

The second menu lets you designate hexes to withdraw or 
attack to, reinforce a hex containing friendly units, and 
examine the status of the corps (good only within one turn dis- 



patch distance from the army commander). 

Both the second and third menus allow setting urgency, 
contact mode, orders to move, patrol, change deployment 
from road to deployed (or vice versa) , and exiting the menu. 

In effect, the player or players fight their battles by dis- 
patches, seldom knowing the immediate effects of their or- 
ders. Changes in the tides of fortvine may make a poor earlier 
move seem brilliant or a good one disastrous. Some orders 
will conflict, leaving a unit marching in place. Orders should 
be given in bunches, rather than every time it's the player's 
turn. 

Waterloo takes five days of turns, Leipzig six. Day turns 
use four hours, night turns eight. In addition, there are rain 
turns, march modes, ferocity, echelon attacks ... all are in- 
volved in Napoleon's Campaigns: 1813 & 1815. 

This is a highly complicated game, one that will take some 
time to learn, despite its well done and detailed instruction 
book, prompt card, color maps, and cardboard counters. 

One minor problem when playing against an opponent is 
the difficulty of keeping your map secret. The map's slippery, 
so you may dislodge yoiir counters if you cover it when you 
leave the room for your opponent's move. 

Another drawback is that, in the solitaire Waterloo scenario, 
you can't play the French side, while in Leipzig you can't play 
the Allies. The sound of battle is supposed to be evoked by in- 
termittent popping from the speaker. Why not a few trumpets 
and some cannonfire? 

These complaints aside, this is such a realistic interpreta- 
tion that any serious wargamer will be entranced. DA

Ceiling Zero. By Stephen Warady. This new arcade game 
comes as a pleasant surprise. Although it seems there are just 
too many shoot em' up games. Ceiling Zero proves that there's 
always room for one more, especially when it's fast, smooth, 
and challenging. 

After the title has been displayed, hitting the button on your 
paddle starts the game, placing you at the bottom of the 
screen. At the top of the screen is the mother ship of the aliens, 
which spews out a stream of smaller ships while moving back 
and forth the length of the screen. The smaller ships pass 
through a micro-deflection beam at various angles, with the 
beam set at ceiling fifteen at the beginning of the game. 

When you have destroyed all the smaller ships at the first 
level, the beam comes down a little and you have a new set of 
terrors to contend with. The first three levels introduce you to 
the three different kinds of alien ships. The first two are fairly 
slow; after a few times of playing the game, they're easily 
done away with. The third level is much harder going; the 
ships become smaller and more difficult to destroy while mov- 
ing considerably faster than the earlier ships. 

Once you hit ceiling twelve, all three kinds of ships are let 
loose on you at once. This is when things get tough. Then, to 
make life even more difficult, there's the landing vessel that is 
sent by the mother ship. Intent on violating your territory. It 
moves slowly in a straight line from the top of the screen to 
the bottom and is a real sitting duck. That doesn't mean it's 
easy to get it, though. You have to dodge all the other ships, sit 
under the landing ship, and blast away. If you miss and the 
vessel manages to land on the bottom of the screen, you are 
promptly killed and sent to a starry grave. Later in the game, 
past ceiling twelve, the landing ship wobbles as it moves down 
the screen, making it even harder to hit. 

You start with three laser-bases and get more at certain 
points in the game. This adds greatly to the game's difficulty. 
You really have to earn those extra bases and they are few and 
far between. But if you get good at it and somehow make it to 
ceiling zero and survive, the mother ship crashes and the 
whole thing starts all over, but faster. 

Stephen Warady's animation and graphics are smooth and 
consistent. As they leave the mother ship, the smaller ships ca- 
reen off the sides, bottom, and top of the screen like in a pong

The Soul of a New Machine. By Tracy Kidder. (Book Review. ) 
The majority of people who use computers probably have lit- 
tle understanding of what a monumental task it is to make one. 
The Soul of a New Machine concerns the building of a super- 
mini computer, the Eclipse MV/8000, or Eagle as it was known 
during its building at Data General in Massachusetts. 

Written at times like a novel, this is the true story of big 
companies and intercompany politics, design teams and vi- 
sionary managers, moments of despair and moments of tri- 
umph. It is the story of people working very hard for some- 
thing more than money and prestige. There is a phenomenon 
in the computer industry known as the all-nighter and It gets its 
reputation from the likes of the Eclipse group, the talented 
team responsible for desig^iing and building the Eagle. 

Thousands of people worked on the Eagle, and Kidder does 
a good job of concentrating on the main characters. At the 
same time as you are reading about the incredible sacrifices 
that went into the making of the computer, you also learn 
something about the individuals and why they are doing it. To- 
ward the end of the book, Kidder turns to John Ruskln and his 
theories of Gothic architecture. In much of modem industry, 
tasks become so fragfmented and simple that it requires an 
army of slaves to put out a product. But, in something like a ca- 
thedral, the individual craftsman is allowed to pursue his tal- 
ents to the utmost. 

This is how it was with the Eagle. The style of manage- 
ment at Data General allowed for a looser than usual atmos- 
phere, where practically anything was possible and any prob- 
lem could be solved. Engineers and programmers soared and 
tried to do the impossible whenever they got the chance. Not 
everything worked, but it was the kind of experience not easily 
forgotten. 

Kidder has done his homework and made this an extreme- 
ly engaging book. For those interested in the history of com- 
puters and particularly the making of them, this nontechnical 
book can offer considerable food for thought. DN

Hi-Res Computer Golf. By Stuart Aronoff . Hi-Res Golf makes 
us consider a new distinction in computer game genres : com- 
puter sports. Only this and one other program would fit this 
category thus far. No, not Computer Quarterback or ditto 
Baseball or ditto Soccer and the like; they are computer 
games about sports. But Hi-Res Computer Golf follows the 
lead of Olympic Decathlon in requiring a form of athletic dex- 
terity in its play. 

In Decathlon, you had to get your fingers in good running 
shape or you were sunk. Now, for golf, you'll have to fine hone 
those fingers for timing finesse in order to swing your clubs. 
Like the pole vault and the shot put in Decathlon, swinging the 
club in Hi-Res Golf is hard— so hard that some people won't 
consider the practice necessary to master it worth the effort. 

For those willing to put in the effort, or those wilUng to risk 
the brand of duffer, Hi-Res Computer Golf is a masterpiece 
game of judgment, strategy, visual keenness, and skill. 

You'll find that the game provides facsimiles of several 
eighteen-hole golf courses of varying difficulty. Start mod- 
estly. Holes may be completely shown on one screen or may 
require two or three screens. Since your judgn^ent of dis- 
tances is important in real golf, all fairways on all courses in 
the game are to the same scale, one hi-res dot equalling one 
yard; this is why a long hole can't simply be represented as 
smaller on one screen. 

All the accoutrements of a real golf course are there to hin- 



der you: sand traps, roughs, pretty and game-deadly lakes and 
ponds, and groves of shady trees. The verisimilitude of the 
game is such that each grove of trees is calculated for the 
heights of its trees. If your drive is a very high one, It may pass 
over smaller trees; a couple of pixels one direction or the 
other, however, and you've collided with a big oak and lost 
your ball among the fallen leaves. 

As you begin a hole, you see your ball on the tee and all or 
part of the fairway ; the toggle to see the rest of a multiscreen 
fairway is quick and simple. For the rest of the review, we'll 
describe a single screen hole. 

With a paddle, you set the direction in which you'll aim the 
ball. You'll have to take into consideration the direction and ve- 
locity of the wind, which is given at all times, and which may 
change even while you are setting up a shot. 

Now you choose a club. You can toggle to your golf bag, a 
text table showing the range of each club at each of several 
strengths. Having determined how far you want the ball to 
travel in the direction you've set, it's easy to choose the cor- 
rect club and the proper strength from the table. You return to 
the fairway and input these values. All this done, you're ready 
to drive. 

Every good golfer knows that you look at only one thing 
when you drive: the ball. And that's what happens here. The 
fairway fades away and you're presented with a simulated 
golfclub swinger. You must guide your clubhead through the 
appropriate arc to hit your ball straight on. If you top it or un- 
dercut it, you'll hook or slice or lob it only a few feet. You'll find 
it all too easy to miss it altogether. This is really hard and will 
require a lot of practice from anyone. 

As soon as your clubhead makes contact with the ball, the 
screen switches back to the fairway and you watch your ball 
move through the air (you hope). If you didn't hit it head on, 
you'll helplessly watch it curve toward that sandtrap or begin 
descending before it even reaches a grove of trees. Sound ef- 
fects are occasional, and one of the occasions is the landing of 
your ball: thud in the sand, splash in the water, bonk on the 
treetrunk, maybe even swish on the fairway. 

Assume — we hope realistically — that you eventually make 
it to the green. Now the screen becomes a closeup of that area, 
and the scale changes. You won't forget because your ball it- 
self is clearly much bigger. Several things are different here. 
That you'll use your putter is assumed, but you must still input 
the strength with which you'll hit it. The wind is no longer a fac- 
tor, but the green is geometrically divided by direction of In- 
cline, and this must be taken into account when you choose 
your strength and also the direction in which you'll aim the 
ball. Once you've set these and hit return, the computer takes 
over and you'll'see your ball go the way you directed it, which 
may or may not be the way you intended it to. There is no 
swing required (hallelujah) in putting. 

You can play golf alone or with a foursome or any combi- 
nation in between. So it is with Hi-Res Golf. The (printable) 
scorecard provides for all these. 

Besides the excellence of the graphics within the context of 
the game requirements, besides the apparent simplicity with 
which they have handled amazingly complex details of simu- 
lation in the physics of ball motion and interaction with the 
club and the elements, besides the remarkable integration of 
outside elements with player input, and in spite of the diffi- 
culty of the game, the authors seem to have thought of every 
possible detail to make playing the game simple and pleasing 
to the gamester. n(T

Tablet owner a comprehensive tool for the creation of hi-res 
displays using the graphics tablet. It provides all of the fvinc- 
tions of the original Apple software supplied with the Tablet, 
although in modified forms. It also provides a great many new 
options for making and modifying images. The strength of this 
package is the wealth of effective options for making hi-res 
graphic displays. Its weakness is that it is quite complex and 
difficult to learn to use, and its documentation fails to make the 
learning process easy. 

A comparison of the features of the Utopia software and the 
original Apple Graphics Tablet software shows the relative 
strengths of each. Both systems make minimal use of the key- 
board, permitting the user to rely almost exclusively on the 
graphics tablet stylus to interact with the program. Both use 
menus to present user choices. In the original Apple software, 
the menu is printed on a transparent mylar sheet affixed to the 
Tablet. In Utopia, there are a number of separate menus that 
fill the screen with choices (up to twenty-two at a time) . The 
main menu appears when the program is first booted. From 
this program level, one can select other menus that permit the 
selection of a new hi-res screen image (with a user-chosen 
background color) , the selection of an old image from disk, a 
choice of pen characteristics, a "tour" through stored images 
on disk, the creation of graphs, and a number of more exotic 
functions. 

Utopia offers a much wider selection of drawing modes 
than does the original software. The user can select 
paintbrushes of a wider variety of colors, widths, shapes, and 
consistencies than are possible from the original software. One 
can choose brushes that draw two, three, or ten parallel lines. 
In addition, one can develop custom paintbrushes and store the 
brush shapes on disk for use in constructing pictures. Very im- 
portant : Utopia offers a fill option that permits the user to fill 
an enclosed area of the screen quickly with a chosen color from 
a palette of sixty-four colors constructed by weaving together 
the different Apple hi-res colors. Utopia has also provided a 
number of functions for softening edges and otherwise adding 
an element of randomness that enhances the realism of repre- 
sentational art on the Apple II hi-res screen. 

The Utopia graphing options, provided on one of the main 
submenus, permit the user easily to construct bar graphs, Car- 
tesian coordinate graphs, and pie charts. Values for the graphs 
can be input either through the graphics tablet or from the key- 
board. A variety of graph labeling modes are provided, includ- 
ing a character-paint option in which a selected character is 
painted on the image in response to stylus inputs. A software 
keyboard filter permits the use of escape as a shift and shift- 
lock key, so that graphs may be labeled in both upper and 
lower case. 

Utopia is difficult to learn to use. While a six-year-old child 
using the original Apple Graphics Tablet software can learn in 
ten minutes how to clear the screen, sketch a picture, and save 
it to disk, an intelligent adult may require an hour or more of 
experimentation and flipping through the user's manual to 
learn how to do the same thing with Utopia. In part, the prob- 
lem is the twenty-four page Utopia manual, which is more of a 
reference book than a tutorial. The confusing (to the novice 
user) structure of the Utopia document stands in sharp con- 
trast to the carefully designed Chapter 2 of the Apple Graphics 
Tablet Operation and Reference Manual. 

Utopia offers the Apple Graphics Tablet owner a gfreatly ex- 
panded set of graphics production tools. The structure of the 
system and its documentation do not facilitate learning how to 
use these tools. Nonetheless, the serious graphics tablet user 
may want to purchase this package and take the time neces- 
sary to learn to make use of its many functions. Afl

The Battle of Shlloh. By David A. Landry and Charles T. 
Kroegel, Jr. This entry from Strategic Simulations is a simple, 
rapid game for a solitary player or two opponents. You can 
play either side in the battle, and adjust the ratings of the ar- 



mies to reflect the players' ability levels. 

The battle is Shiloh, April 6 and 7, 1862. A.S. Johnston'8t:k)n- 
federates, fifty thousand strong, surprised U.S. Grant's Army 
of the Tennessee (forty thousand troops) in an attempt to 
destroy it before it was joined by Don Carlos Buell's fifty thou- 
sand-man Army of the Ohio. 

The attack almost succeeded, but the Union rallied, and fell 
back toward Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee River. John- 
ston fell in battle, leaving P. Beauregard in charge. Beaure- 
gard withdrew to campsites in the rear to rest for the next 
day's assault. But that night, Buell's troops and the Third Ten- 
nessee Division reinforced Grant; the strengthened Union 
drove the Confederates back. 

Unlike most of the SSI sames, the Battle of Shiloh is set up 
so you can see the entire map of the battlefield. You can decide 
to attack or not, even when you're adjacent to an enemy unit. 
You move your pieces from hexagonal position to hexagonal 
position by selecting a number from one to six. Numbers two 
and five are horizontal; the others are at thirty-degree angles. 

The units have historically accurate combat points, leader- 
ship, and morale. They're each named for the actual com- 
mander, as for example, Jackson's Third Brigade of the Con- 
federate Army of the Mississippi. 

One interesting new feature of this game is the use of at- 
tacker's and defender's levels of risk . . . and strategy. Level of 
risk ranges from daring through bold to conservative and 
finally cautious. In terms of strategy, the attacker can decide 
on all-out attack, medium, probe, or reconnaissance. The 
defender may respond with a counterattack, hold, with- 
drawal, or full retreat. 

Each of these choices has some impact on losses. In fact, 
the riskier a unit's choice, the more likely that orders will be 
disobeyed and the message "leader acted on his own initia- 
tive: new strategfies" will appear. Other messages that could 
occur include "leader killed; unit cannot attack due to low 
leadership/morale; units did not receive attack orders," and 
so on. Units don't necessarily have to retreat if given the op- 
tion, but, if they don't, they'll suffer additional losses. 

Artillery fire can be called down on troops ; reinforcements 
and replacements will occur; the Union gunboats can trigger 
artillery on adjacent Confederate troops; morale and leader- 
ship affect what risks a unit will accept. 

Although it's simple (for an SSI game) , there's enough com- 
plexity in Battle of Shiloh to make it a good beer and pretzels 
tactical wargame. It has a save option. DA

Cropduster. By Uriah R. Stukk. The bean moths are coming. 
The state legislature is vacationing in the Badlands and can't 
be reached — their last official act was to ban your one-man 
cropdusting operation. The only thing standing between two 
thousand acres of prime Dakota beanland and agricultural dis- 
aster is your Fokker triplane (in need of repair) and five hun- 
dred gallons of impounded DDT. 

Thus begins Cropduster, the new fantasy role-playing 
home-arcade game from Slipshod Software (Bad Nation, SD) . 
The game is extremely involved and time-consuming; not rec- 
ommended for beginning adventurers. Before you can even 
get to the government warehouse and devise a strategy to 
liberate your illegal insecticide, you must get out of your house 
without arousing the suspicions of your wife/husband/signlfi- 
cant other, an ecological activist. (Alienation of affections is 
fifty points off your score before you even get started.) 

After bribing the right officials or stealing a sufficient 
quantity of the DDT, you must then find a good airplane 
mechanic. The airfield has been closed in observance of Fort 
Midge Heritage Day, so you must taxi your Fokker down to 
Main Street for use as your runway, at which point the time for 
secrecy is obviously past. When and if you come down again, 
you will either be a hero for saving South Dakota's economy, or 
you will be delivered into the hands of the federal marshals— 
or both. (At which point you must go to disk three, Plea

Bargain, and possibly disk four, Escape from Dannemora.) 

Once airborne, life gets even harder. The Fort Midge 
Historical Society is holding its annual picnic in the middle of 
the beanfield. You can attempt pinpoint sprajing— risking 
noneradication of the bean moth menace and a subsequently 
dimmer view of your actions in the public eye — or blanket 
spraying, probably killing all the moths but risking several 
strangulated historians and even dimmer public opinion. Your 
spouse keeps breaking in on the CB to tell you he/she wants a 
divorce. 

There are several other frustrations, most of them ap- 
parently programmed into the game, but others apparently 
not. The third time you run into a power line at an altitude of 
three thousand feet may cause annoyance. The twelve-disk 
business simulation version keeps you apprised of stock 
market behavior and fluctuations in bean futures as affected 
by your ongoing efforts, allowing considerable investment po- 
tential, but it has its own unfortionate tendency to load its Visi- 
Calc interface if you try to spray and bank left at the same 
time. If your plane crashes, the disk will do the same — part of 
Slipshod's well-known emphasis on authenticity and meaning- 
ful consequences. This is not for everyone. 

Intelligent spraying can require considerable entomologic- 
al background (some provided in the exhaustive documenta- 
tion) , as there are beneficial insects and even natural enemies 
of the bean moth concealed in the two thousand acres of bean 
rows. One must fly perilously low to identify them by their 
markings and coloration (hitting a cow is minus twenty-five) . 

You may find you require additional documentation to ex- 
plore the game's potential fully. Unhappily, Slipshod is cur- 
rently embroiled in legal difficulties with a large arcade game 
manufacturer claiming Cropduster to be a copy of one of its 
games. George Spelvin, Slipshod president as well as chair- 
man of the board for the South Dakota Bell System, denies the 
charge, but, while the arcade company tries to serve the in- 
junction. Slipshod has effectively gone underground. For the 
duration of the suit, no Bell System operator in the state will 
give any information on Spelvin, or his company, or even ack- 
nowledge the existence of the entire town of Bad Nation. 

While the lack of support is a problem for the time being, 
Cropduster is, all in all, a satisfying and engrossing foray into 
the realm of rural adventuring, much in the tradition of Slip- 
shod's previous Cattle Drive and Migrant Farm Worker. A(

David's Midnight Magic. By David Snider. Perhaps it's the 
venerable age of the pinball machine concept that makes it ap- 
parently impervious to copjoight questions. After all, with all 
the differences in colors and shapes between games, the basic 
idea is the same : shoot pinballs into a field of chutes and lights 
and bells — a slanted field that encourages the balls to escape; 
then give the player outside-controlled flippers to catch the 
coasting balls and knock them back into the field of play, trip- 
ping as many traps and lighting as many lights as possible. 
Are any two pinball machines more different than Gobbler and 
Snack Attack are different among home-arcades? Are they 
nearly as different as Snoggle and Bezmani 

But pinballs are accepted as a genre and anyone so inclined 
can create variations on the theme. The pinball genre is enjoy- 
able, but it would fade quickly if only one permutation were 
permitted to exist. Perhaps that's where we're coming to a 
greater acceptance of the concept of variations on a theme in 
arcade and home-arcade games. Not a lot of gamesters play 
Hyper-Headon anymore, the game that first used the expendi- 
ture of dots through a maze form. But the genre is still a great 
favorite; people just like variations. 

David's Midnight Magic is a pinball machine on your Ap- 
ple. As such, it bears many similarities to Bill Budge's multi- 
best-selling pinball. Raster Blaster. Only the details have 
changed, and that makes it a whole new ball game. 

Instead of one set of flippers, you get two, one g^uardlng the 
bottom exit chute and the other keeping you scooting around 
the high-bonus-prone top half of the screen. You're after im- 



mediate points and bonus points, extra balls that let you keep 
going, and multipliers. There's a spot at the very top in which 
you can deposit balls and get additional ones for them; the 
third ball entering sets them all free at once. There's a loop at 
the top of the lower area that multiplies whatever bonuses you 
accumulated by the end of that ball — two times bonus for once 
through, three times for twice through, and so on up to five 
times bonus. After five, you get an extra ball to shoot for each 
subsequent trip through the loop. Sounds simple but it ain't 
easy. 

In graphics, animation, smoothness, speed, and general ex- 
cellence of execution, David's Midnight Magic is right up there 
with Raster Blaster. It's another step toward the ultimate mi- 
cro pinball. The next step, it appears, will be pinballs with 
themes built in, causing great variation in looks and feeling. 
For instance, picture a Vegas pinball, where one area of lights 
or traps sets off slot machines; another, blackjack; another, 
craps ; and perhaps each game has a random set of keno num- 
bers to try to match by hitting all the right lights and only the 
right lights ... or a cops and robbers pinball, or basketball pin- 
ball — you get the picture. 

If you loved Raster Blaster, you'll love David's Midnight 
Magic. David Snider may not be an old revered name in the in- 
fant micro world, but he's been doing his homework just as 
well. He's a software author to watch. n(T

quested and walks off; the screen changes (somewhat slowly, 
going to the disk every time), and your friend enters, moves 
centerstage, and awaits your next command. 

The animation is not complete, but it's a good step in the 
right direction. Animated sequences besides walking on and 
off screen are going up and down stairs and fighting, the latter 
varying in the animation with the weapon being wielded by the 
adversary. 

As an adventure, Castles of Darkness seems nearly impos- 
sible when you start; once you cross the first barrier, it seems 
unusually simple for a while. But don't let this discourage you. 
Once you make it to the second castle (What? There's a sec- 
ond castle?), things perk up and the riddles are an enjoyable 
challenge for the best adventurer. 

Let it not be said that sight is everything. Castles of Dark- 
ness occasionally speaks as well. It doesn't happen often, but, 
when it does, you'd do well to heed what it says. 

This is an excellent first adventure from a new entrant into 
the realm of adventure publishers. Its only significant fault is 
the delay caused by frequent return to disk, and this is not to 
discourage you from enjoying the game, but to encourage the 
company to seek methods to speed up the process in the ad- 
ventvires we look forward to their producing in the future. 

One side feature is excellent. Saving of seven games simul- 
taneously is possible, a feature essential for families and of- 
fered by only one other company we know of (although this can 
be done with games that will save to ordinary disks by using a 
different disk each save) . n(T

□ Milestones, by Ken Franklin, Creative Computing (39 East 
Hanover Avenue, Morristown, NJ 07960; 201-540-0445). Card 
games translated to the computer are generally pretty much a 
washout in competing with the real thing, except that the com- 
puter provides an opponent when no human is available. Per- 
haps the most likely to benefit from this genre of software then 
are only children. Milestones is a case in point. 

Designed to simulate a card game designed to simulate an 
automobile trip. Milestones is a good card game for kids, in the 
tradition of Touring and Water Works. All are games parents 
can enjoy too — once in a while, in relatively small doses. 

Milestones, done in brightly colored, cartoony graphics, 
provides a playing companion of infinite patience for the child 
alone. The game requires planning and strategy to win and 
thus is a worthwhile learning game. The idea is to travel 
seven hundred miles before the computer does. You rack up 
the miles by playing various denomination mileage cards, but 
you can only play them after you have played a "Roll 'em" 
card. Meanwhile, you try to thwart the computer by plajdng on 
its stack cards representing flat tires, accidents, red lights, 
running out of gas, and speed limit, and the computer is doing 
the same to you. These delays must be countered by appro- 
priate solution cards or by one-of-a-kind preventative cards, 
such as "Extra Fuel Tank," which renders out^of-gas cards 
useless against you. The first player to get to seven hundred 
miles wins the hand, but both players score their mileage and 
can score various bonuses. 

The game is well executed, plays swiftly and smartly, and 
will provide yoxingsters some good quiet fun when they're 
arcaded out. $19.95. 

□ Robot Tank. By Jay Crafferty, Amber Software, distrib- 
uted by Micro-ware Distributing (P.O. Box 113, Pompton 
Plains, NJ 07444). Out for a Sunday roll, your tank is not hav- 
ing an easy time of it. Although versatile and well armed, it 
must contend with other robot tanks programmed to destroy it. 
If enemy tanks are too easy for you, there are also flying sau- 
cers that come winging down from the sky and attempt to cook 
your goose. 

Requiring a set of paddles. Robot Tank is strictly a shoot- 



'em-up affair. One paddle moves you right and left and fires 
the gun. The other paddle moves you forward and back. When 
an opposing tank is firing at you, a triangle forms on the screen 
warning you to get out of the way. 

Colorful graphics and arcade sounds make the game all 
that more palatable. You get three tanks and three chances to 
reach 500, which means you have killed all the enemy tanks 
and saucers. When you destroy an enemy tank, its turret rises 
up and falls on the ground, making a nice graphic effect. In 
turn, when you are killed, the windshield of your turret 
breaks. $34.95. 

□ Picture Puzzles, by Jim Neville, Creative Computing (39 
East Hanover Avenue, Morristown, NJ 07960; 201-540-0445). 
What's the least likely pastime you can think of to program for 
computer play? If you didn't say jigsaw puzzles, it was only 
because you didn't think of it, right? 

Jim Neville disagreed, and he has produced a program that 
makes a jigsaw puzzle of any hi-res picture you want to feed it 
and lets you play it on the screen. 

What you see on the screen is the interlocking outline of all 
the pieces in the puzzle, only they're blank. You can then riffle 
through the pieces themselves, using the paddles, to pick one 
you want to insert. You paddle a marker to the spot where you 
want to put the piece and, if it will fit the shape, it is inserted. It 
may not be the right spot, though. 

Neville gives you several options for play. You can see the 
picture ahead of time and toggle to it while solving or you can 
work a puzzle without access to the picture ; you can play with 
the traditional interlocking pieces or with squares — which is 
hard. 

Quite a few hi-res pictures come with the program, vary- 
ing from the traditional covered bridge to a modem all- 
squares abstraction. The program runs fast and smoothly and 
the pictures are well done. If you really love jigsaws, you may 
find this a fun addition to your software library, and though the 
sixty-piece puzzles won't challenge you much, the computer- 
ized method will probably make up for it. $19.95. Hi

W PETER OLIVIERI 




Data Base Corrections. All of you who have been keeping 
up with our comments on data bases will want to look at the 
Open Discussion section of the December issue (page 15), 
where you'll find additional comments about and corrections to 
our reviews of both DB Master (Stoneware) and The Data 
Factory (Micro Lab) . Our thanks to the authors of these pro- 
grams for helping us keep the record straight. 

Computers at Tax Time. While we are all obligated to pay 
our taxes, we are also duty-bound to take advantage of any tax 
savings available to us as taxpayers. There's nothing wrong 
about taking advantage of legal tax deductions. Doing so, how- 
ever, requires investing some time in understanding what 
these deductions might be. 

Before we discuss some of the things you should consider at 
tax time, it might be useful to outline briefly certain aspects of 
taxes. While many of the business men and women among owe 
readers are already familiar with these, the new home com- 
puter user may not be. 

If you itemize your tax deductions each year, you are 
already aware of the value of deductions. Each deduction you 
can claim reduces your gross income by the dollar amount of 
the deduction. When you finish taking all of your deductions, 
what remains is the amount of income that will be taxed. Cer- 
tainly, claiming all of the deductions available to you will work 
to your advantage, since it will lower the amount of your tax- 
able income. 

Depreciation. The cost of certain (usually expensive) items 
cannot be deducted in full in the year of purchase. Instead, an 
item of this sort must be depreciated over its useful life. For 
example, a computer for which you paid ten thousand dollars 
might be depreciated over a period of ten years, with deduc- 
tions of $1,000 being claimed each year. As you can see, depre- 
ciating an item is actually like taking a deduction. It too 
reduces your gross income and therefore reduces the amount 
of tax you are required to pay. 

While there are several methods of depreciating an item, 
the new tax laws specify clearly what method should be ap- 
plied to computer equipment. We will look at this shortly. 

Tax Credits. Tax credits, like deductions, have the effect of 
reducing the amount of tax you must pay. Tax credits differ 
from deductions, however, in that they are subtracted directly 
from your tax liability, not from your gross income. (Tax lia- 
bility is the figure that's obtained after you've subtracted all of 
your deductions from your income and then referred to the tax 
tables that are appropriate to your adjusted gross income 
range.) 

Clearly, tax credits are nice. Because they act directly on 
your tax liability, they return even more money to your pocket 
or savings account than deductions do. One significant tax 
credit to be aware of is the Investment Tax Credit. A tax credit 
of up to 10 percent may be claimed on certain property you 
may have purchased during the year in connection with your 
professional responsibilities. The investment tax credit is in 
addition to any depreciation deductions that you may have 
taken. 

Do You Qualify? You're probably already aware that you 
can deduct the expenses you incur in running a business. If you 
also wish to deduct related expenses, take advantage of the de- 
preciation features, and claim an investment tax credit, you 
must be able to demonstrate that you have used the equip- 
ment for business purposes. 



A side business you run from home may make you eligible 
to take advantage of some of the features we've been describ- 
ing. For example, you may be using a word processing pack- 
age to write articles, maintaining mailing lists for local busi- 
nesses, writing programs as a consultant, or learning about 
mathematics packages for your use as a teacher. The IRS will 
be interested in how frequently you use the computer. If you 
use it only once a year to balance your accounts, it's likely the 
IRS will be reluctant to consider your computer a business re- 
source. The key to qualifying for this deduction is that the com- 
puter must be used in your occupation as a tool. (Using your 
Apple at home to play Space Invaders and Olympic Decathlon 
isn't sufficient to demonstrate that you qualify!) 

If you're able to demonstrate that your computer is a busi- 
ness tool or resource, chances are that a variety of other de- 
ductions may also be available to you. In particular, you may 
be able to deduct the cost of maintaining a home office. The 
rules for verifying that you have a home office are stringent, 
but if you feel that you may be eligible, by all means take the 
time to investigate the possibility. Furthermore, if you do 
qualify for deducting your home office, you may then also add 
a deduction for depreciating the portion of your home that's 
used as an office. This could be a fairly substantial sum. Don't 




forgiet other possible deductions including supplies, books, disk- 
ettes, paper, electricity, insurance, and the sales tax on your 
computer. 

As mentioned earlier, the new tax laws provide a new 
method of depreciating your computer. It is called the Accel- 
erated Cost Recovery Systems (ACRS). Under this system, 
computers are depreciated over a five year period (over a 
three year period if they are used in research and develop- 
ment). The depreciation schedule is as follows: 15 percent in 
year one, 22 percent in year two, and 21 percent in each of the 
last three years. Thus, if you had bought a $6,000 personal com- 
puter that you used for business purposes, you could claim a 15 
percent ($750) deduction in the first year. 

In addition, you may claim an investment tax credit for 
equipment with a five-year life which is being depreciated over 
those five years. This 10 percent tax credit is one of the better 
savings available to the taxpayer and should be looked into. 

What Next? You may be beginning to feel burdened by the 
complexity of all this. Indeed, tax requirements and regula- 
tions do require you to do your homework, but as you can see, 
substantial savings may be the result of your effort. 

Next month, we'll look at some programs you can piu"- 
chase for your Apple that will help you find your way through 
much of the maze. Although these programs can't make the 
decisions for you and can't determine your eligibility for cer- 
tain deductions, they can help you with some of the mathe- 
matics. You and your tax advisor will have to tackle the other 
sorts of questions. 

Many books are available that can help you along the way, 
among them J. K. Lasser's Your Income Tax (Simon & Schus- 
ter, $5.95) . If you're a teacher, don't be without the Tax Guide 
for College Teachers (Academic Information Services, $13.95) . 
If you buy a book, be sure it includes the latest tax changes and 
the new 1981 tax forms. In particular, you'll want to look at 



Form 3468 (Investment Tax Credits), Form 2106 (Use of 
Equipment in Your Occupation), Schedule C (if self-em- 
ployed), and Schedule A (for itemizing deductions). 

A Final Warning. Please be advised that I am not a tax ex- 
pert or specialist. I want to point out to you some areas for con- 
sideration, but telling the IRS that "Olivieri said it was so" 
won't reduce your prison term by any substantial amount. Do 
purchase a tax book (it's deductible). Then if it seems appro- 
priate, see a tax specialist. It can save you money. 

The Learning System. Micro Lab has introduced a pack- 
age called The Learning System. This method of teaching re- 
quires a 48K Apple with Applesoft in ROM or a language card, 
as well as one or two disk drives with DOS 3.3. As is the case 
with many packages, a printer provides enhanced capability. 

As we survey some of the features of this package, its utili- 
ty to both teachers and students will be quite apparent. The 
reason we are reviewing this package here is that it also has 
some rather useful applications in the business/office environ- 
ment. 

Essentially, The Learning System allows the user to create 
a variety of tests. These tests can then be administered to stu- 
dents, and the performance of the test takers can be moni- 
tored. Provided with the system is an original master diskette 
(with backup), as well as two player disks. Questions, an- 
swers, and student records are stored on the master diskette. 

The master menu presents the following list of options : test- 
ing, creating tests, creating compositions, reviewing of student 
scores, status of tests, deleting tests, and initializing user 
diskettes. 

The creating tests option allows the user to create three 
types of tests: fill-in, column matching, and multiple choice. 
"There is a lot of flexibility within each of the categories. For ex- 
ample, when creating a fill-in test, you can specify a preferred 
answer, an alternate answer, and a hint. And for column

THE 

GENERAL MANAGER 



THE SHORT CUT TO YOUR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT NEEDS 



Easy to use— Simply design the screens you wish to use for data entry. Your 
database is created automatically. 



Information may be retrieved such as: list all customers who owe over 
SI. 000 with an invoice over 30 days old or who owe over $10,000 dollars. 



• APPLESOFT interface provides complete access to your information and 
allows you to tailor THE GENERAL MANAGER to YOUR needs. 

• Selected fields from selected records can be written to a standard text file. 




• Expand your database at any time with no loss of existing data. 

• Easy to use reporting capability provides automatic formatting and totals. 

• Easily sort the entire database or selected portions for reporting. 

• Full range of calculation capabilities including logical operations. 

• Your database can span over one hundred disketts using one to four drives 
or a hard disk. 

• Complete tutorial and reference manual. 



Some database programs let you perform calculations so you can 
easily handle economic projections, sales forecasting, and cost 
accounting. Other database programs give you a wide range of 
search and selection options so you can find the information you 
need to make daily decisions. Still others format the screen for 
easy data entry so anyone can use the database. But now, one 
database program PUTS IT ALL TOGETHER. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER is designed after large mainframe 
database management programs. The hierarchial structure allows 
up to sixteen unique record formats which interrelate to form the 
total database. You design the screens the way you want them 
and then fill them in. It's just like working with a set of blank 
forms. Information from one screen can be automatically used in 
other screens. Any fields can be used in complex calculations to 
figure costs, interest, payment terms, discount rates, recipe 
proportions, and many more applications. The data built on one 
screen may easily be used to make comparisons or build totals on 
another screen. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER provides easy-to-use APPLESOFT 
interface using the ampersand command which allows user 
programs to read, write, update and delete database records. 
Uses for this interface are limited only by your imagination. In 
addition, using your selection criteria, THE GENERAL MANAGER 
can write selected fields of selected records to a standard DOS 
text file to be used by word processors or other existing 
programs. 

Visa, MasterCard, Check, COD 



With THE GENERAL MANAGER you are never stuck with your 
original database format. You may change the length and type of 
fields, add and delete fields and add entirely new screens at any 
time with no loss of existing data. As your needs change The 
GENERAL MANAGER will change with you. The unique access 
method of The GENERAL MANAGER allows your database to 
span over 100 diskettes using from one to four disk drives or a 
hard disk while at the same time using the minimum amount of 
disk storage to store your data. The GENERAL MANAGER has 
the flexibility to handle a recipe file or an entire business system. 

A complete tutorial and reference manual leads you through the 
many uses of The GENERAL MANAGER and presents a number 
of solid applications. 

THE GENERAL MANAGER is designed to work FOR you. You 
mold it to your operation and it gives you the information you 
need, when you need it, in just about any format you want it.

matching tests, extra choices can be listed if you like. You can, 
of course, modify tests once you've created them. 

The creating compositions option allows the user to com- 
pose material that can be used as a pretest learning aid. 
Material in these compositions can be matched difectly to test 
questions, and can even be designed to work with several ver- 
sions of your tests. It can be displayed before the student takes 
a test. 

Testing is, of course, the main task of the system. When you 
select this option, you are asked to choose which test you'd like 
to administer. Students may elect to be given instructions (in 
which case, the appropriate composition is displayed) or may 
proceed directly with the practice drill. Questions answered in- 
correctly will automatically reappear at the end as a retest. 
Once they've completed the practice session, students may 
take the actual test. Test scores are stored on disk. 



obligations) , leverage ratios (the extent to which the company 
has been financed by debt) , activity ratios (how effectively re- 
sources are used), and profitability ratios (the overall effec- 
tiveness of management). 

The cash flow program provides a cash flow projection for 
the month following the current month twice a month through 
three future months. Knowledge of your cash flow will enable 
you to meet expenses and plan for other asset acquisitions. 

The Analyzer includes sections on balance sheet analysis, 
interfacing with the general ledger, customizing the Analyser 
for your organization, and end-of-month closing procedures, as 
well as a variety of utilities. 

Obviously, to use this package you must first have the Con- 
troller. If you do have the Controller then you really should add 
this package to your Ubrary. Dakin5 is committed to providing 
the business user with as thorough and complete a package as 






The student score review option allows the test creator to 
look at what tests students have taken and at their scores on 
those tests. A detailed display of students' performance is 
provided. If you have a printer, you can print copies of tests, 
compositions, student scores, and test analyses. 

The application of this particular package in an educa- 
tional setting are easy to see. But there are many equally good 
applications in business that may not be immediately obvious. 
The Learning System could be used, for instance, when you're 
evaluating applicants' skills for a particular position in your 
organization. A variety of office procedures could be taught, 
using the computer as a teaching tool. In this way, employees 
may become familiar with certain company policies, proce- 
dures, or rules, or even with how to operate a computer. 
Because of the compositions option and the feedback that the 
system provides, employees can learn in a very positive way 
at their own pace. The Learning System's applications are 
limited only by the imagination of the user. 

The Learning System is a useful package — certainly a val- 
uable addition to both the personal and professional software 
library. The user's manual is well written and provides a 
variety of examples that guide the user through all phases of 
test construction and administration. 

The Analyzer. A few issues back we discussed The Con- 
troller, an accounting package from Dakin5. Now a com- 
panion product. The Analyser, is available to accompany it. 
The Analyser is designed to assemble, evaluate, and dis- 
tribute monthly information in reorganized forms that are pro- 
duced by the Controller. For example, a budget master option 
allows you to display projected budget figures, the true figures, 
and the differences. A profit and loss analysis compares dollar 
amounts for this year with those of last year on a monthly, 
quarterly, or year-to-date basis. 

For those who wish to perform some financial analysis, the 
Analyser provides a report of the sources and uses of funds and 
displays the changes in the balance sheet from last year to this 
year. In addition, some seventeen financial ratios can be com- 
puted, including liquidity ratios (the ability to meet short-term

possible and intends to release companion packages as appro- 
priate. A new product, the Depreciation Planner, which can be 
linked to the Controller or used alone, has just been released. 
The documentation is complete and the user guide is well done. 

The Readers Speak. "I currently have a single Apple in my 
business. It is clear that we could use several of them (per- 
haps one on each manager's desk). Is it possible for several 
Apples to share data on a disk? Can the Apples 'talk to each 
other'? How do I find out more information about these possi- 
bilities?" K. S., Houston, TX. 

Yes, it is possible for several Apples to share the same disk, 
and it is also possible for them to talk to one another. The fea- 
ture you are describing is more formally called networking ; 
that is, using a network of microcomputers. This is not a new 
concept, and in fact, several organizations now have Apple net- 
works in operation. Under this arrangement, each user has his 
or her own computer to work with, can access a common data 
base, and can communicate with other users. In addition, each 
user can share any peripheral equipment (such as a high- 
speed, letter-quality printer). 

A network of this sort would require (in addition to the Ap- 
ples you'd add) : a large storage capacity hard disk (don't for- 
get to consider backup) , interface cards for each Apple, and 
connecting wires, as well as a printer. 

At present, we're aware of four manufacturers that pro- 
vide network capability to an organization. These are Corvus 
Systems, Nestar Systems, Santa Clara Systems, and Micro- 
mation. In a future issue, we will discuss networking in depth. 
Perhaps we might even profile a particular business user. 

Take care until next month. Let me know if there's some- 
thing in particular you'd like to see covered In the future.

This episode is supposed to cover editing and introductory 
graphics. It won't, "niere just isn't space to cover both this 
time. And since you're supposed to finish the spinach before 
you get dessert, we'd better begin with the editing and save the 
graphics for later. 

Editing. The Apple keyboard has three keys that are de- 
signed for editing. They are the two arrow keys on the right 
side and the key marked ESC on the left. There are two times 
to edit a line : before you have pressed the return key (easy) 
and after you have pressed return (a little harder) . Let's take 
an example. Type new and then home (pressing return after 
each one, of course). Now iype this: 

10 PRINT "THIM IS OUR FINEST HOUR." 

Don't press return. The flashing cursor should be blinking 
right next to the final quotation mark. As you may have no- 
ticed, the word this has been misspelled. To remedy the situa- 
tion, use the left arrow key to back the cursor up until it is posi- 
tioned directly over the mistake. Then type S and use the right 
arrow key to advance the cursor to the end of the line. Then 
(and only then) press return. 

What has happened is this. As you type on the computer, 
each character you type (up to a maximum of 268 characters) 
gets stuck into an area of memory called the keyboard buffer. 
This information is ignored by the computer until you press re- 
turn, at which point the computer examines the buffer to see if 
you said an3d;hing of value. 

The left arrow is a signal to move the cursor one space to 
the left and to remove the last character thrown into the key- 
board buffer. It does not relate directly to what is on the 
screen. This may not make much sense until we talk about the 
ESC (escape) key in a couple of minutes, so jvist file it in your 
pending buffer. 

The right arrow is a signal to copy whatever character the 
cursor is sitting on top of into the keyboard buffer and then to 
move the cursor one space to the right. Generally, it saves the 
effort of retyping a line. Don't ever fall into the trap of using 
the left arrow to back up to an error, fixing it, and then press- 
ing return. Everything backed out of the keyboard buffer by 
use of the left arrow has to be replaced there, either by re- 
typing or by using the right arrow. 

So much for the easy part. But what if the fatal return key 
has been pressed? How do you get up to that blemish in the 
code? (Some of the more observant may already have noticed 
the absence of an up arrow key on the keyboard.) This is where 
the escape key comes in. 

The escape key can be used to position the cursor on the 
screen. There is a diamond on the right part of the keyboard 
made up of the I-J-K-M keys. These keys can be used in es- 
cape mode to move the cursor up, left, right, and down. To get 



into escape mode, just press the key marked ESC once. Now 
press the I key and watch the cursor move up one line. If you 
accidentally press any key other than these four (with a few ex- 
ceptions that we aren't going to get into right now) , you will 
exit escape mode and will have to press the escape key again 
to get back into it. 

When you are in escape mode, nothing that you type gets 
put into the keyboard buffer. You can travel from one comer of 
the screen to the other, passing over words, line numbers, and 
whatever assorted trivia you have on your screen, and your 
buffer will still be as clean as a whistle. The only way to put 
anything in that buffer is to leave escape mode and then either 
type a character or use the right arrow key to copy something 
from the screen. 

Now that we know what we are doing, let's try some practi- 
cal examples. Type new and enter the following listing: 

10 HOME 

20 VTAB 10: HTBB U 

30 PRINT "THE STORY OF":HTAB 14 

40 PRINT "MY LIFE"; 

50 HTAB 14: PRINNT " ":HTAB 14 

60 PRNT "BY PEACHIE KHAMA" 

Make sure to include all the mistakes. Try to run it if you like. 
Bingo. "Syntax error in 20." It won't be the last time. 

Now to edit out the mistakes. Type list. Then press the es- 
cape key and use the control diamond of I-J-K-M to position the 
cursor over the 2 at the beginning of line 20. Using the right ar- 
row, copy over the line until the cursor is on top of the error. 
Correct the error and then continue to copy the rest of the line 
with the right arrow key. 

Finally, press return, and the new corrected line 20 will re- 
place the old one in the Apple's memory. Type ftome and then 
list to check this. 

Next, let's remove the semicolon at the end of line 40. It 
shouldn't be there anyhow. Escape up to the beginning of the 
line. Then hold the right arrow down and press the KEPT (re- 
peat) key on the right side of the keyboard until the cursor ar- 
rives at the semicolon. With the cursor on top of the semicolon, 
press return. No more semicolon. 

When you bounce around a lot on the screen, it may start to 
get a little cluttered with bits and pieces of old Unes. "rhere are 
a couple of quick commands for cleaning up the screen that 
you might want to make note of before continuing. Both are en- 
tered from escape mode. Escape-® (the escape key followed 
by shift-P) will clear the entire screen, just like the command 
home. Escape-F will clear the screen from the cursor on down, 
a very handy command to remember if you have to do a lot of 
editing. 

Deleting and inserting are perfectly possible using the edit- 
ing commands. Let's try a deletion first, since it is a little sim- 
pler. LIST the program and look at line 50. The PRINT com- 
mand has an extra N in it, so enter escape mode, cursor up to 
the 5 in 50 and then use the right arrow key to copy over until 
you reach the first N in PRINNT. Now reenter escape mode by 
pressing escape and press K to skip over the first N. Then con- 
tinue with the right arrow key across the rest of the statement 
and press return. Type escape-F list 50 to see the results of 
your handiwork. 

You may have noticed that the first time you pressed the 



WE'RE BUILDING UP SPEED 




A recent article in "INTERFACE AGE" tested 45 of the most 
used BASICs on 48 different microcomputers. That article 
judged that if you are an APPLE owner writing programs in 
APPLESOFT, you have the nineteenth fastest BASIC/com- 
puter combination tested.* 

-THAT WAS BEFORE EXPEDITER II.- 

If you're an APPLE owner with EXPEDITER 11 writing 
programs in APPLESOFT, you can now have your BASIC 
program judged second in the same comparison - with a 
minimum of effort. You need only LOAD your program, BRUN 
EXPEDITER, then save your program. iStlt^H^ 

EXPEDITER II is a new programming utility which translates 
your APPLESOFT programs into machine language, usually on 
the first try. Problem spots in the code are flagged during 
compilation. The new compiled code supports all the features of 
APPLESOFT including HI-RES graphics, shape tables, LO- 
RES graphics, defined functions and DOS commands. 
EXPEDITER II is the only compiler to support global string 
variables easily. There is no additional BASIC syntax to learn. 
The only real difference you'll notice with the new program is 
that it's faster - usually two to twenty times faster. 

Other APPLESOFT compilers are available for the 
APPLE, but none have all the features of EXPEDITER II. 
EXPEDITER II, with its new MEMORY COMPRESSION 
OPTION can reduce your compiled program size by up to 50 
percent. (Remember: a machine language program is normally 
bigger than a BASIC program that does the same thing). It's also 
compatible with MMS II** to help you solve any memory 
problems you might encounter. 



The race has just begun 

We make your compilation process easier by providing a 
symbol table and address listings for each line of your BASIC 
program. EXPEDITER II even allows you to reserve areas for 
machine language subprograms or graphics. Debugging is 
facilitated by EXPEDITER lis support of the Applesoft TRACE 
command. 

We at ON-LINE SYSTEMS believe that the APPLE II is a 
powerful machine, and we're constantly trying to make it better 
and easier to use. TTiats why we offer a full line of utilities written 
by some of the best programmers in the field. The only limits we 
, feel the APPLE should have, are the limits to your imagination.

right arrow after using the escape commands, your Apple 
failed to respond. This is because the Apple takes the first non- 
edit character as a signal to leave escape mode rather than as 
an actual character. Not to worry. If you use the repeat key 
and the right arrow together, you may not even notice it. 

Insertion is a little more difficult, but only a little. We hap- 
pen to have a candidate for insertion in line 60. Escape up to 
the 6 in 60. Then use the right arrow to cursor over until the 
cursor sits atop the N in PRNT. At this point everything up to 
the N has been entered into the keyboard buffer. Now reenter 
escape mode and press J to backspace one space (do not use 
the left arrow— the left arrow will delete the letter R from the 
keyboard buffer, and that would never do). Then press the 
space bar (or any other key) to exit escape mode and type the 
missing I. You should then be able to cursor over the rest of the 
line without any problem and press return. 

As you have doubtless noted, the line now looks something 
like this: 

60 PINT "BY PEACHIE KHAMA" 

However, list the program again and look at line 60 as it ap- 
pears on the screen. It should look correct now. 

Run the program now. You may want to go back and edit it 
some more to spruce it up. Or then again you may not. 

Long Programs and Long Lines. If you have gone off on any 
tangents before now and tried to write some longer programs 
on your own, you may have run into a couple of problems that 
we haven't discussed yet. If you write a program that is more 
than twenty-four lines long you will find that it doesn't all fit on 
the screen at one time when you list it. In fact, the part of your 
program that interests you may have scrolled completely off 
the screen before you can examine it. 

You can stop the screen listing in midstream by pressing 
control-S, and if you are quick enough you may get just the 
part you want in front of you. Pressing any key will then cause 
the listing to resume. If you want to break into the listing or 
call the whole thing off, use control-C. 

If you want to list only a part of your program, you can 
qualify the list command: list 100-200 works, as does list 200-. 
You can substitute a comma for the hyphen if the spirit moves 
you — ^the Apple shows some rare flejdbility in this instance. 

Now on to the problem of long lines. As we mentioned, the 
Apple takes whatever you write and formats it by adding 
spaces between commands and by indenting certain lines to 
make it all more readable on the screen. There is one flaw in 
this scheme of things. If a line needs editing, automatic for- 
matting can be a real nuisance. Suppose you want to edit the 
following line in your program: 



10 



PRINT "THIS IS THE WAY THE WO 
RLD EMDS." 



As you can see, this line wraps around onto two rows, and the 
part that needs editing is on the second row. To edit this you 
must enter escape mode as usual and then use the edit dia- 
mond to position the cursor over the 1 at the beginning of the 
line. If you then use the right arrow and repeat keys to push the 
cursor along until you reach the error (remember, of course, 
to cursor to the end of the whole program line once the correc- 
tion has been made) , you will get something like this when you 
run the program: 



THIS IS THE WAY THE WO 



RLD ENDS. 



Look familiar? Join the club. You can avoid this in any of 
several waj's. First, when you are copying the line by using the 
right arrow key, you should stop as soon as you have reached 
the space after the O in world. Press escape at this point, cur- 
sor to the right with the K key until the cursor is positioned 
over the R, and then continue with the right arrow key to the 
end of the line. There are better ways, however. 

The best way is to go down to your local computer store and 
purchase Neil Konzen's Program Line Editor (Synergistic 
Software), the most valuable programmers' utility an Apple- 
soft programmer can possess, and one of the least expensive. 

Alternatively, you can annihilate the Apple's formatting 



propensities. As we mentioned earlier; the Apple's screen has 
forty columns; that is, up to forty characters can be printed on 
a single row. If the screen width is narrowed to less than thir- 
ty-four characters, the Apple automatically turns off its screen 
formatter. 

The Apple keeps track of the number of characters it is sup- 
posed to print on each line in an area of its memory called the 
zero page. Without getting into the details of where things ac- 
tually are under the hood, this is an area used internally by the 
Apple and not ordinarily visible to us. However, it is possible to 
peek into this area and even to modify it if we know what we 
are doing. Try typing the following direct command : 

PRINT PEEK (33) 

Location 33 is the area in memory where the screen width is 
stored. If we haven't messed with it, it will always return a 
value of 40. Now let's mess with it. 

Go ahead and type in the line 10 above, including the mis- 
spelling at the end. Then type escape- @ to clear the screen. 
Now let's change the screen width. Type : poke 33,33. The com- 
mand poke a, b means put the value B in the address A. If you 
now type print peek (33), you should see the new value. 

Now list the program: 

10 PRINT "THIS IS THE WAY THE WO 
RLD EMDS." 

Use the escape mode to position the cursor over the 1 as be- 
fore and then push the cursor along with the right arrow. When 
you get to the O in world, don't stop. You'll see the cursor jump 
directly down to the R at the beginning of the next row. When 
you've finished copying the line after you've made the correc- 
tion, press return. Then type poke 33,40 and press return again. 
When you run your program, everjdhing should be hunky- 
dory. 

Now you are a full-fledged editor. Next time, it's on to bet- 
ter and bigger things. No more spinach.

routines were in memory, Apple has not 
been trying to hide them from los, but they 
are simply unable to state their location 
because of their agreement with Micro- 
soft, who wrote the language Applesoft 
for them. (This is also why they haven't 
given us a disassembled version like they 
have with the system monitor.) 

I believe the routines in this letter are 
correct, and I will be happy to answer 
any questions I can. 
Steve Brodsky, Stanford, CA 

My guess is that a number of readers 
have already responded to your request 
for the machine language addresses of 
Applesoft's hi-res graphics subroutines. 
This information is not too difficult to 
find, if you know where to look. Having 
been in the same situation before (I 
wrote a hi-res air combat program in Ap- 
plesoft that I wanted to convert to ma- 
chine language) , I quickly discovered (as 
I'm sure you have) that the Apple and 
Applesoft reference manuals were of lit- 
tle value on the subject. Below is a list of 
Applesoft's hi-res graphics routines that 
you (or anyone else) may find useful:

As I stated earlier, these addresses 
have appeared many times in various 
club newsletters and Apple publications. 
One such place is page 83 of Nibble, Vol- 
ume 2/Number 3, 1981. 1 recommend that 
you look this over, as it gives the regis- 
ters that you need to load with certain 
values (X and Y coordinates, for exam- 
ple) before calling some of these subrou- 
tines. For a more complete reference of 
all Applesoft's subroutines, see the ex- 
cellent publication ot Apple Orchard, Vol- 
ume 1/Number 1, March/ April, 1980, 
pages 12 through 18. Please note that 
some of the values given here for the hi- 
res routines are incorrect; corrections 
appear on page 34 of the fall 1980 Apple 
Orchard. 

If you're really serious about convert- 
ing a number of Applesoft programs to ma- 
chine language, you might want to consid- 
er an Applesoft compiler. However, if 
you want your program to be completely 
independent from the language in ROM 
(or don't have megabucks to spend) , you 



might be better off to assemble the pro- 
gram yourself and write your own set of 
graphics subroutines. (This brings up the 
subject of hi-res graphics in Assembly 
Lines, which appeared in December's 
Open Discussion in a letter by Ted 
Young. I feel Mr. Wagner eventually 
plans to present this information to inter- 
ested readers; however, being a very 
complicated subject [graphics anima- 
tion without the use of Applesoft's sub- 
routines], I think it is still quite a ways 
away. Besides, what would there be left 
to cover after that?) 

I hope this information can be helpful 
to you, Ace, and anyone else interested in 
using Applesoft's hl-res commands from 
machine language. 

James Baker, age 16, Alexandria, VA 

In response to Ace Ck)lter's letter from 
the December issue of Softalk, I'm four- 
teen also, and in this letter I will give you 
the addresses for the routines you 
wished. I suggest that you also obtain a 
book that I just recently purchased that 
maps out the entire RAM memory plus 
ROM subroutines and special addresses 
for the Apple II and n Plus. This book 
gives the special uses, if any, for all loca- 
tions in the Apple, which is invaluable to 
any Apple 6502 programmer. Its name is 
What's Where in the Apple, by Professor 
William Luebbert. The book is published 
by Micro Ink, 34 Chelmsford Street, 
Chelmsford, MA 01824. 

Getting back to your routines, here 
are the entry points for several routines 
and addresses. Hposn, xdraw, and draw 
use the Y register for the horizontal MSB, 
the X register for the horizontal LSB, and 
the accumulator for the rotational fac- 
tor. (Use the hi-res map in the Apple II 
Reference Manual to find positions.) 

Draw $F601 (-2559) 

Hplot $F453 (-2989): plots point after 
hposn is called 

Hposn $F40D (-3059) : uses A register for 
vertical position 
Scale $00 E7 (231) 
Hcolor $0324 (804) 
Xdraw $F65D (-2467) 

Only hposn has a horizontal MSB and 
LSB ; draw and xdraw use the MSB and 
LSB for origins. 

If you have Integer Basic and the Pro- 
grammer's Aid #1, then you can use the 
addresses found in the ROM listings at 
the back of the that manual. 
Myles D. Greenberg, Andover, MA 

I am writing in response to Ace Colter's 
letter in the December issue. The Apple- 
soft hl-res routines are listed in Call- 
A.P.P.L.E In Depth: All About Apple- 
soft, pages 55 and 56. If you have Integer 



Basic, the same routines are on the Pro- 
grammer's Aid #1. Descriptions of these 
are in the Programmer's Aid #1 Manual, 
complete with source listings! Good 
Luck, and happy plotting! 
Joe Schwartz, Andover, NJ 

Here are a few goodies about using hl-res 
graphics from machine language in re- 
sponse to several of the letters in Open 
Discussion. I, too, hope Roger Wagner 
will soon treat the subject more authori- 
tatively and in depth, but, until then, here 
are some things to get you started. 

The following information comes 
from All About Applesoft, a Call- 
A.P.P.L.E. In Depth magazine, avail- 
able to members of the Apple Puget

In an article entitled "Applesoft In- 
tervals," Jim Crossley lays bare many of 
the entry points for Applesoft, including 
floating point functions and utilities, ini- 
tialization routines, miscellaneous Basic 
commands, and of course, entry points 
for the hi-res graphics routines. In 
"Notes on Hi-res Graphics in Applesoft," 
C. K. Mesztenjri expoimds more fully on 
the Applesoft hi-res graphics routines 
and here are a few of the secrets re- 
vealed: 

HGR = JSR $F3E2 —will InltlaUze hi-res 
graphics page 1. 

HGR2 = JSR $F3D8 —will initiaUze hl-res 
page 2. 

HCOLOR= JSR $F6F0 —will set plotting col- 
or to a number from 
0 to 7, which must 
be passed in the X 
register. 

HPOSN = JSR $F411 —position (but doesn't 
plot) a point on the 
hl-res screen. The A 
register must con- 
tain the Y coordi- 
nate of the point, the 
X register the low 
order byte of the X 
coordinate, and the 
Y register the high 
order byte of the X 
coordinate. 

HPLOT = JSR $F457 —similar to hposn, 
but plots the point 
on the screen. X,Y 
coordinate passed 
identically to hposn. 

HLINE = JSR $F53A —draws a line from 
last point hposned 
or hplotted to the 
point passed in the 
registers as fol- 
lows: Register Y 
contains the Y co- 
ordinate, register A 
contains low order 
byte of X coordi- 
nate, and X register 
contains high order 
byte of X coordi- 
nate. 



Hope this will help get a few people 
started. Would like to also congratulate 
Softalk for a great magazine, taut also 
plead for a magazine shipping wrapper 
of some kind in order to thwart the ef- 
forts of the U.S. Post Office. The last is- 
sue of Softalk had its cover completely 
separated from the magazine, and the 
two issues of Softline I got looked like 
wrappers from yesterday's lunch. I 
would gladly pay a couple of bucks to 
have it shipped to me in a manila en- 
velope. After all, Softalk is one of the best 
Apple magazines around, and you can't 
beat the price! 
Randi Rost, Davis, CA 

The unbeatable price has fallen vic- 
tim to a year's time limit, but note the 
way your Softalk arrived this month — a 
baggie, yet. 

Chefs Might Feel Left Out 
Besides being extraordinarily stupid, the 
[C&H Video] ad [October 1981, page 141] is 
an extremely good example of blatant 
sexism. I wonder if it has ever occurred 
to to the C&H Video Company that males 
can also cook, and that perhaps a "wife" 
might be running the computer, not the 
male of the household. If the leaders of 
this company, presumably males, really 
want to do something nice for their 
wives, perhaps they could stop running 
ads which portray women in this light. 
There is enough software junk on the 
market already. One hopes C&H Video 



will quietly fade away.

Tongue-in-Cheek Paul Strikes Again 

Thanks to your readers I have solved my 
recent problem with my eighteen-inch 
disk containing my favorite programs. 

I am working on a new program en- 
titled "How Not To Pay Income Tax at 
All," which will include sutaroutines such 
as: 

How to have more cash in your pocket 

each month. 
How you can taenefit from inflation. 
How to tauy income property with 

$10.00 down. 
How to double your money each year. 
How to invest your money to make 

more money than you will ever 

be able to spend. 
How to do this without leaving your 

home. 

Because of my limited skills in 
programming, any help your readers can 
offer to get this program going would be 
appreciated. 

I have an Apple II, a TRS-80 Model I, 
an Underwood manual typewriter, and 
an Atari pong game all in good condition.

I am a sixteen-year-old High School 
Senior and a reader of Softalk for the last 
two years. I wrote a College Entrance 
Essay which may be of interest for your 
Open Discussion section. 



Jossy and the Apple 

Two years ago a new addition to our 
family changed my life. This offspring 
was bom in Silicon Valley, California. Its 
name was Apple II Plus. 

Apple has become an important mem- 
ber of our household. We try to share it 
equally; sometimes it is hard! 

When I first used it, I thought it was 
the most clever electronic game I had 
ever seen. One word of command would 
display a whole world of fantasy and fun 
on the monitor. Then I became curious 
about the programming that made that 
entertainment possible. I started to learn 
Basic. I liked this language. It reminded 
me of an endless puzzle where each piece 
had its own place in the proper sequence. 
It also often frustrated me with the dis- 
play "syntax error." Then, with work 
and patience, I would find the "bugs," do 
my "debugging" and ... I had working 
programs ! 

Now I want to learn the different lan- 
guages that make the computer work for 
humans. Today Fortran, Cobol, Pascal, 
and others are just names to me. 
Tomorrow I want these names to be- 
come my tools. I want to acquire that 
knowledge and create with it. I am also 
fascinated by the inner works of the 
microprocessor and the technology that 
is changing the way we live. 

When I first saw the Apple sitting in 
our family room, I did not know I was 
looking at my future. Now I do know.

Welcome back to the Basic Solution. It 
is really gratifying to see the favorable 
response that many of you have for the 
Basic Solution. The majority of the ques- 
tions will be answered in upcoming is- 
sues. 

Lawrence Grabinski of Burbank, IL, 
has written a very interesting letter in 
which he explains a way to improve and 
speed up the Knight's Tour program 
presented in the November issue. 
Lawrence used Hayden's Applesoft 
Compiler to speed up the execution of the 
Basic code. For those of you who did not 
believe the Knight's Tour was possible, a 
printout is supplied for your review.

WORKING ON NUMBER 64 

If any of you are interested in receiv- 
ing a copy of this program, please send a 
self-addressed envelope, to Knight, in 
care of Softalk, for a photocopy of the 
routine sent in by Grabinski. 

This month's Basic Solution deals 
with one of the most irritating aspects of 
the Basic input statement. How many 
times have you written a program that 
requests a number of some type, then 
found yourself running all over the house 
for a pocket calculator to multiply or 
divide or add some numbers together to 
answer the computer's request? There 
you are with $2,000 worth of computing 
equipment and you're searching for a $10 
calculator to do a simple mathematical 
problem. 

Wouldn't it be wonderful if Basic 
would interpret your input and do any 
mathematical functions requested by the 
user? The enclosed subroutine will 
analyze a string for the occurrence of any 
mathematical character, perform the 
functions requested, and return in a 
string the proper value. 

This same routine will check for the 
occurrence of string data and not per- 
form any mathematical functions, there- 
by allowing the routine to be used for any 
general input. 

Those users familiar with the input 



structure of VisiCalc will immediately 
appreciate the structure and power of 
this subroutine in Basic. 

The Basic Solution is anxious to hear 
from Softalk readers who have created 
original programs that they would like to 
have included in the Basic Solution. A 
$10.00 credit at your local computer store 
will be awarded to any author whose sub- 
routine is published or mailed out to 
Softalk readers. If any of you have 
questions about this month's subroutine, 
please write in as soon as possible so we 
can include your comments in our up- 
coming issue. Please direct all corres- 
pondence to Softalk Basic Solution, 11021

HEAVY TRAFFIC: 

Apples and Metro Traffic 
Take the Drag out of Rush Hour 

BV DAVID HUHTER 



It's a wet and cold New Year's Day and the clouds are 
hanging low in the sky. It has just stopped raining and you're 
swooping through the skies of Los Angeles en route to Pasa- 
dena. 

You've been up since before dawn and the noise in the 
three-seat helicopter is shaking you up, but you'll survive. 
Your job is to report the traffic conditions on the freeways into 
Pasadena. They should be jammed for the Rose Parade and 
again for the Rose Bowl football game. 



Arriving in Pasadena, it is about how you expected it — a 
mess. You make your reports and you do your job with zeal. It 
is a beautiful morning and you are glad to be in the air. The 
pilot sunngs over the Rose Parade for a moment and you gaze 
down on the throng. They are a million strong and they are 
only barely aware of your existence. 

And yet you are a part of much of their lives. Not neces- 
sarily this particular day, but every working day. They expect 
you to be up there every day, making their freeway driving

easier. lAttle do they suspect what a great time you have while 
you're doing it. 

Flying Blind. One of the greatest banes of modem living is 
the daily commute. It comes in many forms: subways, trains, 
buses and cars. Any way you look at it, time is wasted and spir- 
its are dampened. 

Short of working at home or working the graveyard shift, 
there is no way to escape the mental frustration and physical 
discomfort of traffic, congestion, and crowds. 

One solution is to redesign cities, making the movement of 
individuals fast and comfortable, at an affordable cost. In 
Larry Niven and Jerry Poumelle's latest novel, Oath of 
Fealty, a cubic structure two miles on each side is erected in 
the city of Los Angeles. The gigantic structure, Todos Santos, 
is a city within a city where the inhabitants travel short dis- 
tances by subways, escalators, and elevators. They never have 
very far to go. 

The future may see the elimination of the daily commute in 
one way or another. Telecommunications will free certain peo- 
ple to work from their homes. Building huge structures is one 
way to control the movement of people ; elaborate people-mov- 
er systems and monorails are other ways. 

But this is cold comfort for today's commuters stuck on the 
Dan Ryan Expressway or in the Lincoln Tunnel in bumper-to- 




bumper traffic. They're looking for something to make their 
lives easier today. 

How do you make the undeviating sameliness of com- 
muting less so? You read a book, listen to the radio, smoke, or 
look at members of the opposite sex. It also helps to know just 
what's holding you up and how long it will take to get where 
you're going. 

All forms of commuting have their less than charming as- 
pects (freezing on a train platform in the dead of winter makes 
for a jolly time) , but the car seems the least tormenting of all. 
In a car you can smoke, drink coffee, listen to the radio, and, 
most important, be the master of your own destiny on the 
roads. Unlike a case of entrapment within a train or bus, you 
can change routes in mid-commute should the need and op- 
portunity arise. 

Millions of people begin each day the same way. They get 
into their cars, turn on the radio, and drive to work. 

Morning radio stations with a heart have a friendly an- 
nouncer with a deep voice who makes a few jokes and plays 
some kind of waking-up music or engages in harmless talk. 
News and weather reports are universally accepted subjects 
for the morning, as well as the usual deluge of advertise- 
ments. Sometimes it is soothing and sometimes it provides for 
a rude awakening. 

Something that's popped up in recent years is the phenom- 
enon of periodic traffic, informing the listener where 
accidents and other problems are occurring. The traffic report- 
ers offer alternate routes or at least projected travel times. 

Birth of an Idea. It took a Baltimore snowstorm, a traffic 
jam, and a sharp individual like David Saperstein to put two 
and two together. Sitting in his car one wintry day three years 
ago, Saperstein was fascinated by the traffic reporter he was 
listening to on the radio. The announcer was in a car, re- 
porting from the road, providing up-to-the-minute information. 

Many radio stations across the country use their own in- 
house traffic reporting services. But the cost of quality report- 
ing from the air and on the ground is often beyond the budget of 
a single radio station. Partial or inaccurate reporting can frus- 
trate and alienate an audience fast. There is nothing worse 
than hearing that the George Washington Bridge has light traf- 
fic when you're inching along the Long Island Expressway. 

Today, David Saperstein is the president of Metro Traffic 
Control, which provides traffic information to more than 
twenty-four million commuters in twelve cities across the 
United States.

FEBRUARY 1982 S C) ^ T A 



Every weekday and most holidays a small army of pilots, 
announcers, and technicians awake before dawn and arrive for 
work at five in the morning. The battalion of Apple computers 
that assists the employees of Metro Traffic Ck)ntrol are not 
spared the early wake-up call. 

In three years, Metro has grown from a two-city service to 
one that includes Boston, Houston, Atlanta, Denver, Minnea- 
polis, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, and the latest addition, Los 
Angeles. Metro has succeeded incredibly since Saperstein first 
envisioned a traffic reporting service for the Baltimore and 
Washington DC areas. Saperstein had no inkling when he 
started that the idea would take off so fast. 

By the end of 1983, Saperstein hopes to have conquered 
twenty-five of the top thirty nationwide markets. There are 
even more ambitious plans afoot for the coming years, which 
should help solidify Metro's position as the foremost traffic re- 
porting institution in the country. 

The key to all this success has been what Saperstein calls 
the credibility factor. It has been proven that people will trust 
on the spot reporting more than studio reporting. Actually, the 
reports gathered by the mobile and remote units could be sent 
to the studio and read over the air with no substantial delay in 
communicating the information. But it is much more effective 
to have an announcer in the plane or truck making the report 
from the scene. 

Saperstein didn't stop there. Fixed positions from high 
vantage points over freeways can be just as good as planes and 
trucks. Metro invades the top of the Washington Monument at 
certain times each day, as well as a host of other high spots 
overlooking freeways across the nation. 

Apple at the Core. With all of these various means of gath- 
ering information scattered all over a metropolis at a given 
time, a central location was needed to coordinate the activity 
and process the information. 

At the typical Metro studio there is an announcer, a couple 
of technicians, broadcasting equipment, two-way radios, and 
the Apple. The computer operator and the person who takes 
the incoming traffic information sit on one side of a console 
with an amputated Apple keyboard embedded in one end, 
while the announcers and an engineer sit on the other side. The 
Apple, its keyboard and top removed. Is bolted upside down un- 
derneath the top of the console with the disk drive attached 
rlghtside up next to it. 

Portions of the traffic information are stored on the Apple 
and teleprompted to the announcer. In preparing a report for 
broadcast, the announcer in the studio reads the items off the 
Apple and then includes one or more reports from the mobile 
units; drivers usually double as announcers in the ground 
units. 

The final effect is of having a main announcer who reports 
major problems and the general conditions of traffic, com- 
plemented by on the spot updates from the road or the air. 
Among other things, this format allows Metro to use existing 
announcers from participating stations. 

A case in point is the new Los Angeles operation. Rhonda 
Kramer had been reporting traffic at KHJ radio for five years 
when Metro Traffic approached that station with its offer. KHJ 
was interested but didn't want to lose Kramer, who had be- 
come a familiar voice to the listeners. Metro simply incorpor- 
ated her into the format and everybody was happy. 

Saperstein's grand scheme is to utilize the proper mix of 
local people familiar with the area and experienced national 
people to keep things running smoothly. This spirit of moving 
into an area and using local resources has another practical 
application. Metro always approaches established aviation 
companies for the renting of planes and hehcopters. Trucks 
are cheaper than planes so Metro owns and operates its own 
fleet of ground vehicles. 

Tim Kenney is the experienced national figure who came 
from Denver to be the general manager of the Los Angeles 
operation. Rhonda and Tim get along extremely well and 
make for a dynamic duo. It's essential that people get along to- 
gether in this business. The hours are long and the work can 



89 

get positively frantic at times. 

Rhonda Kramer is a good example of how much people en- 
joy this line of work. She liked flying so much while doing the 
traffic that she took it up as a hobby and now is a pilot. 
Knowing that you are up there, free, while all those other 
people are stuck on the ground in traffic must be slightly in- 
toxicating. 

Glen Ivey works out of Dallas and is the brains behind Me- 
tro's computer system that utilizes Apple computers. He is a 
self-avowed self-taught programmer who spent a great deal of 
time hopping computer stores looking for the right machine. 

Ivey decided on the Apple for several reasons. The most Im- 
portant was mobility. Metro uses Apples in many exotic loca- 
tions and even has them in trucks in some cities. Another fac- 
tor for choosing the Apple waa reliability. It is unthinkable to 
have the computer down in the middle of rush-hour traffic. 
Ivey tested an Apple for months to make sure it would stand 
the strain of being in use sixteen hours a day. 

All the programs that Metro employs are the work of Glen 
Ivey. Working at first only in Applesoft, Ivey eventually found 
that certain subroutines would have to be written in machine 
language. 

Basically, the Apple has two functions in the day to day 
reporting of the traffic. Its primary function is to list traffic in- 
formation that can be scrolled through by the announcers as 
they broadcast on the air. Its second function is to compute 
driving times for a myriad of routes, taking into account de- 
lays or the lack of delays, as the case may be. 

This second function is accomplished by feeding into the 
computer a group of previously compiled times for specific 
routes in various situations. In the course of a normal day, the 
driver of a mobile unit will radio in the speed he is traveling 
and his time will be compared against the data in the Apple. A 
driver may actually be going slower than normal and not 
realize it, but the computer will. The driver is then informed by 
the studio that something is up ahead and to continue on and in- 
vestigate it.

Ivey describes the program like this : it is like the night of 
an election, where the news services can predict a winner with 
only a fraction of the results. 

The first function is really more than just putting up infor- 
mation on a screen. Ivey wrote a program for a split screen 
format where the lower portion of the screen displays infor- 
mation ahready gathered and the top portion of the screen is re- 
served for any information that may come in at the last 
minute. An announcer can change in the middle of a broad- 
cast and add the newest update. 

Ivey likens it to a messenger coming up to Walter Cronkite 
in the middle of his news broadcast and handing him a piece of 
paper with an up-to-the-minute development. 

Ivey has tried all kinds of things on the Apple and many 
ideas have been discarded in the process. Ivey admits to 
having asked things of the computer that shouldn't have been 
asked, although some worked out in the long run. The final pro- 
grams have been very successful and Ivey is pleased with the 
results. Apparently, the biggest problem with the drive time 
program is that some people don't drive at the same speed as 
the mobile unit (they always try to stay with the flow of traf- 
fic) , which will throw the projected time off. 

One effect of Metro's spectacular growth is that they have 
need of more Apples. As a matter of fact, they are in the proc- 
ess of purchasing approximately twice as many as they now 
have, close to $100,000 worth of Apples. This will bring all the 
offices nationwide up to the same standard. For the more than 
two hundred Metro employees, more Apples will be a wel- 
come addition to the staff. 

Writing an in-house program is not a unique achievement, 
but it is one that makes programming satisfying in a different 
way than producing a software package or game. Ivey is very 
proud of the system he has put together, but has no plans to sell 
it at this time or in the foreseeable future. All Metro's pro- 
grams have been copyrighted as they have emerged.

reason why traffic reporting should be limited to radio, and 
Metro has been investigating television and its potential for 
imparting this kind of information. Ideally, an accurate road 
map, updated on the Apple, will be sent to a television station, 
with color codes and markings indicating the traffic condi- 
tions. The announcer in the studio can then refer to the map in 
the course of his or her report. 

Another experiment that Metro has been trying is putting 
Apples into the mobile ground units. The always inventive en- 
gineering department has custom built compartments for 
holding the Apple, after it has had its keyboard and outer shell 
removed. Through the use of two-way radios, the driver can 
produce a report on the spot and send it to the studio in the 
form of hard copy coming off a printer. This is accomplished by 
using a 1,200 or 600 baud modem with a normal interface to the 
Apple, which is interfaced to a two-way radio. The radio fre- 
quency is generally aa reliable as telephone frequencies. 

Saperstein envisions this system having many uses other 
than reporting traffic. Ultimately, Metro may go into straight 
news reporting. With the Apple in the truck, a news story could 
be sent to a studio as quickly as a telephone call but in its final 
form, ready to be read on the air in a very short time. Soon 
there may be a lot of disgnintled rewrite men who find them- 
selves being challenged by the Apple. 

Metro Traffic Control is concerned with more than just dai- 
ly commuter traffic, though that is the lion's portion of their 
work. Holidays are notoriously crowded on the roadways. 

This year's Rose Parade crowd was huge and jammed 
things up greatly. Fortunately, the rain early New Year's Day 
kept some people off the road. A million people showed up for 
the parade, but a million and a half had been anticipated. In 
any event, everything went fairly smoothly and Metro's first 
Rose Parade was a success. 

Other aspects of Metro's operation allow for sending up a 
plane in an emergency situation in ten minutes. Metro often 
gets information of stranded cars and accidents from its mo- 
bile units before the police or highway patrol. They pass on any 
information they think will be useful. 

Although the Metro mobile ground units are normally not 
allowed to stop, sometimes it just can't be helped. One poor 
driver stopped once because a big dog was loose on a freeway 
in Baltimore. Trying to be helpful, the driver got out of his van

FEBRUARY 1982 



and attempted to get the dog and hold it iintil it could be 
transported safely off the freeway. He got bitten for his ef- 
forts. 

In another incident, a Metro driver was caught in the mid- 
dle of a police shootout on a surface street in Denver. They 
closed off the street, but he was already caught in the middle. 
Proving his journalistic mettle, he crawled under the truck and 
reported the shootout as it was taking place. 

When the freeways are traffic-free or there are no major 
difficulties, Metro often turns to problems on surface streets, 
going out of their way to provide a good product. The barom- 
eter for judging whether they are doing a good job is listener 
response in the form of letters and telephone calls. 

Saperstein attributes much of Metro's success to the strong 
group of people working in the company. "I'm the weakest 
one. I just take people to lunch and dinner." While Saperstein 
is wining and dining potential new customers, a typical mobile 
ground unit may rack up two thousand miles a week. 

Saperstein is no slouch, though. He may rack up fifteen 
thousand air miles a week, supervising various operations and 
meeting with potential customers. 

At this point it costs approximately a quarter of a million 
dollars to set up a Metro traffic studio, including the cost of 
mobile ground units, but excluding the cost of airplane and 
helicopter rentals. The cost is worth it to Metro and the stations 
that use it. Saperstein boasts that the stations who use Metro 
almost always see a rise in their ratings, while stations who 
choose not to lise Metro watch ratings go down or stay the same. 

Metro has no competition at this point and Saperstein hopes 
the head start they have gotten will keep them in the lead in- 
definitely. There may be imitators, but that's a compliment 
and Saperstein can live with that. 

The bottom line with Metro is the working atmosphere. At 
certain hours of the day, things pile up and it gets hectic in the 
studio. But that's nothing new in the radio industry and most 
people seem to enjoy it. You never know what will happen 
next. 



This is also true with the mobile ground units. No day is the 
same as the one before or the one to come. It seems like a para- 
dox, but it appears that being stuck in traffic can be less than 
frustrating. If it's your business to be there and you aren't 
racing to get home or to a football game, then why not make 
the best of it. 

The pilots and announcers in the air are perhaps the 
luckiest of all. There is something about flying in a small plane 
or helicopter that makes you want to do it again and again. The 
Metro corps is like a modem-day dawn patrol that also doubles 
as a late afternoon patrol. They are a hearty, reliable bunch 
and they enjoy their work immensely. 

Never at a loss when it comes to emphasizing the reasons 
for Metro's successes, Saperstein has a painting above his desk 
that explains a lot of it. The painting is of Babe Ruth walking 
away from home plate dragging his bat. The caption reads; 
"Babe Ruth strutk out 13,080 times." People don't remember 
you for your strikeouts, but for the home nins you hit. 

Carrying the baseball analogy further, Saperstein believes 
that life itself is like the national pastime. Everybody has a 
chance to bat and it is up the individual to swing or not. In busi- 
ness, and in life, you have to take chances. Of course, many 
people try to steal second base with their foot still on first. 

In the great baseball game that is life, Saperstein is having 
a grand time. "It's like working in Disney World." Meeting 
people and providing a much appreciated product have made 
this dashing Baltimore used-car salesman a star in the big 
leagues. There are many innings left and many more at bats. 

Commuting and crowded freeways will be with us at least 
until the end of the decade. By that time, maybe we'll have 
found an easier way to move people or have redesigned our 
cities and style of working. This is a task for scientists, 
engineers, and visionary leaders. 

For the moment, we have to live with what we've got and 
make the best of it. Metro Traffic Control and its battalion of 
Apple computers is going a long way toward making traveling 
our highways safer and easier.

If you decide to use any of the electronic database services 
to gather information for your portfolio, you can use a pack- 
aged software program to retrieve the data for you and thus 
avoid having to enter it manually. There are several packages 
available designed to do just this. As with any other multi- 
brand product, you'll need to identify your needs and then con- 
sider several factors to select the best one for you. Some cri- 
teria you should determine are : In what form can the data be 
stored? Is the file structure acceptable to other programs I am 
considering? What is the vendor's backup policy? How well 
supported is the package by the vendor? 

This month, we'll review three packages. Two are dedi- 
cated to the Dow Jones News Retrieval Service and one to 
Compuserve's Microquote. 

Dow Jones News and Quotes Reporter, by Apple Computer 
Inc., 10260 Bandley Drive, Cupertino, CA 95014; (408) 996-1010. 
$95. 

Backup policy: Master and backup disks supplied with pur- 
chase. Replacements made through Apple dealers. 

Vendor Support: Varies from dealer to dealer; overall is 
adequate. 

Hardware compatibility: Acoustic or direct connect-dlal 
modems ; Apple II or Apple n Plus with 48K RAM. 

The Dow Jones News and Quotes Reporter includes a con- 
tract to subscribe to The Dow Jones System. The contract is 
executed with the dealer, and all arrangements are made at 
the time of purchase to receive the local Dow Jones access 
number and a password. The cost of the package Includes a 



one-hour leisure time usage prepayment on the Dow Jones 
System. If buyers have previously purchased any of the other 
packages in the Dow Jones series from Apple, they'll receive a 
$25 credit to their account. The first time the package is used, 
it's necessary to customize the package. You're required to en- 
ter the local Dow Jones access number, your password, and 
the printer line width (for making hard copy) . 

After this housekeeping has been taken care of, you're 
ready to log-on to the Dow Jones System. If you are using an 
autodial modem (such as the Hayes Micromodem 11) the soft- 
ware will dial the local access number, make connection with 
Dow Jones, and log-on using your password. If you are using 
an acoustic modem, the package will display the access num- 
ber to dial manually. After you have dialed this number, and 
hear the carrier signal (the high pitched whine) , you are in- 
structed to place the receiver in the coupler and press the re- 
turn key. The software will then connect you to Dow Jones and 
log-on in the same fashion described earlier. 

The package does not allow you to access any of the other 
services available on the Dow Jones System. If you try to ac- 
cess other Dow Jones services, you will be disconnected from 
the Dow Jones System. You will then have to dial back 
manually and log-on to the Dow Jones System. You can re- 
quest the desired service using the Dow Jones Commands. 
Dow Jones supplies the necessary instructions, which are 
easily mastered. 

The documentation supplied with the software is well writ- 
ten and clear. There Is a glossary of stock market terminology

in the back of the booklet, which is liseful. 

The package does not have a provision for storing data on 
disk, thus the user must enter the data manually into an- 
other program that will store it. Also, the program requires a 
modem to be in slot 2 of the Apple, an inconvenience. The 
package would better allow users their choice of modem 
placement. 

This package is one of the earlier progframs from Apple. 
Given the current state of the art, it is nothing more than a 
Dow Jones System utility. It would be an ideal package to be 
given as a bonus to anyone who subscribes to that service. 

Consequently, an investor planning to use the Dow Jones 
News/Retrieval service would do better to contact Dow Jones 
directly to subscribe; the Dow Jones News and Quotes Re- 
porter, in its present state and especially at its present cost, is 
not an effective tool for the investor.

MA 01721; (617) 881-5190. $80 

Backup policy: Copyable. 

Vendor support: Excellent. 

Hardware compatibility: Hayes Mlcromodem II; Apple II 
with Applesoft firmware card or 16K RAM expansion card; 
Apple II Plus with 48K RAM. 

The Dowlog program Is an excellent utility program for 
fetching stock quotations from the Dow Jones Database. The 
program is easy to use and versatile. 

The first time the program is used, it must be cohfigwed; it 
requires you to enter a set of fixed parameters that it will use 
to fetch and print your data. The program allows you to have 
your modem and printer in any slots, and it has the capability 



for utilizing two disk drives — one for the program disk and one 
for your data disk. This feature means that you won't have to 
touch your Apple until after you've been disconnected from 
Dow Jones, thus saving log-on time and expense. 

After you've configured, or initialized, your system, you'll 
be required to format a data disk. The program expunges DOS 
so you have additional storage on the disk. 

You can then create a list of stocks (using ticker symbols) 
that you wish quotes for. You can add or delete stocks from this 
list at any time. This editing capability allows the stock list to 
save the fetched quotes in a different data file. However, if you 
wish to have daily information for your portfolio on the stocks 
you're tracking, you should create just one stock file with all 
the symbols. This will save you time and obviate the need for 
multiple log-ons. 

Once you've created your stock lists, you're ready to log-on 
to the Dow Jones Database. By selecting the menu option 
"fetch stock quotes," you prompt the program to dial and 
make connection with either Telenet or Tymnet, request the 
Dow Jones Database, and log-on. Dowlog will then go directly 
to the current quotes database, fetch your quotes, and discon- 
nect. After disconnecting, the program will save your fetched 
quotes in a data file on your system. You then have the option 
of displaying the quotes on your monitor or getting hard copy. 

The program is very fast and makes the most economical 
use of your time on the Dow Jones System. The speed of Dow- 
log is such that it will literally pay for itself through the time 
charges you save over attempting to retrieve this information 
manually from the Dow Jones Database. The program also al- 
lows you to enter quotes manually (from a newspaper or other

source such as Barron's Market Laboratory). 

Another part of the package, the Dow Jones Terminal Pro- 
gram, logs you onto Dow Jones and places your Apple in termi- 
nal mode. Thus, you'll have access to all the other features of 
the Dow Jones System without the drudgery of logging on 
manually. 

Dowlog has an edit feature that allows you to change the file 
headers, should you wish to use these files for other commer- 
cial programs or your own. Dowlog also allows you to edit 
manually the price information you have saved in the files. 
This feature can be used for correcting inaccurate manual en- 
tries, changing fractional information to decimal format, or 
translating prices into foreign currencies. 

There are three utility programs included with Dowlog. 

Change date allows you to change the date of your data file. 
You may want to do this if you update your data files after mid- 
night, and the date shows the next day. Thus, December 12, 
1981 closing prices will be available as current quotes until the 
opening of the market on December 13, 1981. 

Read shows you how to read your data files. It is designed 
to be used by the investor who wishes to do some custom pro- 
gramming and use the data stored by Dowlog in his or her own 
program or to convert the data files to a structure required by 
other programs. 

Fraction changes the fractional values in your quotes to 
decimal form. Some of the commercially available stock 
analysis packages require decimal information. 

Dowlog is a well executed package ; any investor who plana 
on using the Dow Jones Database to collect stock price infor- 
mation will find it well worth the price. 

Microquote, by Stock Market Software, 44 Front Street, 
Ashland, MA 01721; (617) 881-5190; $75. 



Vendor support: Excellent. 
Backup policy: Copyable. 

Hardware compatibility: Hayes Mlcromodem 11; Apple II 
with Applesoft firmware card or 16K RAM expansion card; 
Apple II Plus with 48K RAM. 

The Microquote quote program is a retrieval package that 
uses the Compuserve database as its source of data. It is simi- 
lar to the Dowlog program ; however, the Microquote package 
is designed to take advantage of the historical stock prices 
available on Ckjmpuserve. 

Microquote will retrieve both current and historical data. 
The program has a feature called "vacation update," which 
will update your stock files for thirty days or thirty weeks, de- 
pending on whether you're using daily or weekly information. 
The advantage of this feature is that the investor need not log- 
on every day to get data. The historical fetch will retrieve price 
information for up to 30 stocks for as many as three-hundred 
days or weeks, depending on the information the investor is 
using. 

All the other features of the program are identical to those 
described for Dowlog. The program disk has a Read program, 
like the one in Dowlog, for daily, historical, and vacation data 
files. 

I'his program is strongly recommended for any investor 
who retrieves stock price information from Compuserve. The 
program is fast, thus saving time charges, and it is a conve- 
nient way not only to gather but to store price information. 

The next article in the series will begin to explore software 
packages that manipulate investment data. These packages 
fall into three general categories: analysis packages, portfolio 
management packages, and decision generators.

Picture, if you will, being able 
to bring together and confer with 
some of the most creative minds 
of the century about subjects that 
concern you. puzzle you. Intrigue 
you, or make you curious. And," 
while you're at it, imagine not 
being constrained by such mun- 
dane, yet pivotal considerations 
as time of day. place of meeting, 
and schedules of participants. 
Your meeting cah take place? 
whenever the mood strikes you,- 
even in the middle of the night, 
and it can go on for days, weeks, 
even months at a tlrhe. 

Imagine, too, that although 
■ discussion has a feeling of 
lediacy that's characteristic 
of conversation, you're also free ; 
to take time out to digest the is- 
sues and to formulate your re- 
sponses to the questions raised. 

Daydream Come to Life? The 
mental image you've Just gen- 
erated may not differ markedly 
from reality. Your picture may, in 
fact, resemble CtommuniTree, an 
innovative teleconferencing sys- 
tem for the Apple that began op- 
eration in March of last year. The ; 
conferences It makes possible via 
computer need not be simultane- 1 
ous in either time or place; they 
can occur with a minimum of de- 
lay and a maximum of user con- 
enience. 
Although it was established less 
a year ago, OommuniTree 
has been a regional winner in a 
contest sponsored by Johns Hop- 
kins University for new micro- 
computer applications for the 
handicapped; the award honored 
a flagship tree (renamed Kno- 
where) set up especially to dis-

the disabled. This tree, inciden-

dream put forth by Joe Villareal

Based in San Francisco, Callfomla, the CommunlTree 
group consists of John James, a premier Forth programmer 
whose past experience includes programming on an IBM 360 ; 
Dean Gengle, writer and conceptual cofounder, who often 
speaks for the project ; and Stephen S. Smith, whose degree is 
in psychology. Each one brings the benefit of specialized 
knowledge and unique perspective to the group. 

The CommunlTree system consists of two main facets. The 
first is comprised of conference tree installations located in 
various parts of the country. Personal computer users who dial 
in to these trees via modem can connect with others about 
common interests and concerns. The unique treelike structure 
of the conferences facilitates both discussion of issues and dis- 
semination of information. People find it easy to make contact 
with others and to organize from scratch around particular in- 
terests. 

The second major element is what makes the conference 
trees possible: it's the CommunlTree software. Created by 
John James, its availability permits individuals in any com- 
munity to plant and nurture their own trees. Requirements for 
setting up an Apple CommunlTree system are a 48K Apple n 
or II Plus equipped with monitor and disk drive and a Hayes 
Micromodem n. 

You don't need to own the software or a 48K Apple to make 
use of the various conference trees. All you need is a micro- 
computer or terminal, telephone, and modem. 

Communicating with other Apple owners via modem is 
neat, all right, but if you own a modem and have used some of 
the more than two hundred bulletin boards across the country, 
conference trees may not sound like anything remarkably 
new. But the name CommuniTree and the descriptive term 
conference tree were not arrived at without deliberation; they 
were chosen with care to describe a concept and communica- 
tions system profoundly different from the bulletin boards you 
may be accustomed to. Dean Gengle calls the conference tree 
"a new communication game with its own rules." The more

The CommuniTree Group: Dean Gengle, Steven S. Smith, and John James. 

one learns about CommuniTree, the more meaning this re- 
mark has. 

Linear Arrangement Makes for Long Way Around. Mes- 
sages on conventional bulletin boards are stored in linear 
fashion. They are linked together sequentially by date of en- 
try. Gaining access and responding to messages that intrigue 
you is often a time-consuming process that involves wading 
through lots of messages that don't interest you at all. In addi- 
tion, users who might want to read your bulletin board mes- 
sage are likely to have trouble finding it in the first place. And 
bringing together the threads of a multlentry Information ex- 
change that's taken place over a period of time is even harder 
to do. 

Consequently, few in-depth discussions occur directly on 
electronic bulletin boards. You'll probably see many more one- 
shot messages — announcements, hardware swaps, and the 
like, than you will sharing of views and information on an on- 
going basis. 

Branching Out. Here's where the CommuniTree begins to 
look less and less like the familiar bulletin board. John James 
describes his creation as a "tree-structured database of mes- 
sages, with categories and subcategories determined by the 
users." 

Conference tree messages are arranged hierarchically by 
subject; that is, they're attached to other messages that have 
to do with the same topic and are stored by related groups. 
This branching structure, as opposed to the linear one of bulle- 
tin boards, makes information access easy and orgajilzed. It 
also enables a user to follow a discussion from its origin or root 
outward through its various branchings and buds to its full 
foliage. 

CommuniTree has only nine basic commands, and four of 
these — read, browse, index, and add-to — serve most users' 
needs quite handily at the beginning. When users first dial into 
a system, they're given an explanation of the setup and com- 
mand structure and encouraged to "read help any time." The 
help files are extensive and make the system self-instructing'. 

Typing in the command read conferences is the easiest way 
to find out some of the discussions that are underway on a par- 
ticular tree. Unless a discussion takes place on a private 
branch of the tree (in which case it won't show up in the con- 
ference listing) interested users can tune in on any topic they 
choose, listen in on the discussion that's taken place so far, and 
respond if they want to. 

From the Inside Out. According to Grengle, some deep and 
powerful sharing takes place on the conference trees. The feel- 
ing of privacy and the absence of social role barriers are part 
of what makes this kind of sharing possible. 

Many of us have had the experience of becoming 
acquainted with someone over the telephone or through let- 
ters. Even though we've never met, we become friends. If we 
do meet this person later on, after our friendship has already 



FEBRUARY 1982

been cemented, we may be surprised — our friend doesn't look 
anything like we pictured. Had we met in person first, perhaps 
we would not have become so close after all. 

People who connect via CommuniTree often have a similar 
experience. While the system does require maintenance at 
regular intervals from an operator, users are ordinarily free to 
interact with a minimum of Intrusion. The medium seems to 
be conducive to people's talking about ideas and questions that 
really matter to them, and, in the process of such interaction, 
people sometimes come to feel that even though they may 
never meet in person, they know one another on the inside. 

Most conference trees also have what is known as a private 
branch. This is a section of the tree on which people can have 
confidential conversations. Private is a message name that 
stops the read, browse, and index commands from showing 
any of the message names attached to private. You must know 
in advance the specific name of the private branch you want in 
order to read it. 

Would You Care To Leave a Message? A user entry by 
which a discussion topic is initiated or responded to is known as 
a message. The message name the user chooses can be up to 
twenty characters long and usually is an attempt to convey to 
other users the subject of the entry. Sometimes, a message ti- 
tle is designed to pique the curiosity of other users, motivating 
them to read the message and perhaps to participate in the dis- 
cussion. Messages themselves can consist of up to fifty eighty- 
character lines (equivalent to approximately one single- 
spaced page of typewriter copy) . 

The message index is stored in RAM. This makes message 
indexing and access speedy and uncomplicated, but it also 
means that only 321 messages (no matter what their length) 
can be handled at any one time on a 48K Apple. (The addition 
of 12K of RAM allows space for 321 more messages.) So, when 
certain branches of a discussion become particularly active, 
the system operator can divide the original topic from which 
they sprang into subtopics and transplant these onto another 
computer, while messages that are judged to have outlived 
their usefulness may be pruned from the branch to allow space 
for new ones. 

Responding to a conference tree message is done by means 
of add-to. This command puts the user into an on-line edit 
mode. The main emphasis here is on spontaneity, rather than 
on the physical appearance of the finished product. In this 
sense, the conference tree can be thought of as a sort of inter- 
active word processor. 

The on-line editor is easy to use. The text of the message 
you create is displayed on screen in eighty-character lines — 
broken into two forty-character lines — as you enter it. You can 
make changes as you go along by backspacing, and you can 
read your completed message and rework it as desired on a 
line-by-line basis. Once you've polished your message to your 
satisfaction, you can ask the system to do a savepermanent, 
which will save your message to disk. Until you do this, you 
can alter the text of your message or change your mind alto- 
gether about sending it. 

A New Form of the Family Tree. The message that kicks 
off discussion of a particular topic is known as the root and as 
the parent of following messages on the same topic. Users who 
respond to this original message create children of the parent ; 




Diagram 1. 

A simplified diagram of a conference tree. Inset is closeup of one branch. 

related messages in response to the same parent are siblings of 
one another, while submessages of submessages are grand- 
children of the original parent. This family tree can go on for 
generations. The branching effect shown in diagram 1 illus- 
trates this process. 

Its hierarchical structure and user friendliness make Com- 
muniTree a facilitator of dialogue. People become involved, 
and their ongoing contributions to discussions build on one 
another and cover a lot of ground. Organizers of Communi- 
Tree suggest that the engaged interaction between concerned 
people may have a synergistic effect that results in creative so- 
lutions to modem problems. 

Teleconferencing capabilities have been available on main- 
frames since the late sixties. Teleconferencing of this sort is 
usually a rather deliberate process in which experts who think

of themselves as experts communicate with one another about 
prespeclfled topics. 

James's goal In creating the CommunlTree software was, 
on the contrary, to come up with a versatile, low-cost medium 
that could be used by ordinary, thinking citizens who have ac- 
cess to microcomputers, not just by heads of corporations or 
computer sophisticates. He has succeeded admirably. Com- 
munlTree conferences bring together In anonymity people who 
might never have known that such a connection was de- 
sirable. And this Is done without expensive hardware. In addi- 
tion, the same software can be used in a variety of ways, de- 
pending upon the needs and imaginations of users. An on-line 
technical meeting or journal, complete with immediate feed- 
back, a multlcontributor movie or restaurant guide, or a way 
for retired executives to keep in touch with their fields and with 
each other — all are possible. 

James himself is responsible for an imaginative and for- 
ward-looking application of the CommunlTree software. The 
Berkeley tree he operates currently Includes a forum for struc- 
tured discussion of "all aspects of nuclear war and how to pre- 
vent it." 

As system operator, James has suggested some ground 
rules for the discussion. He asks that xisers focus on supplying 
information, not argument, and that they make an effort to 
support their opinions with references to the material they 
have read or seen that leads them to hold a particular view. He 
has also "primed the pump" by starting subconferences on 
current events, organizations, books, government reports, ar- 
ticles, films, packets, and periodicals related to nuclear war. 
There's also a category called personal overview in which 
people can talk more generally or subjectively about their feel- 
ings and opinions. Users' contributions to tWs conference in- 
clude book and movies reviews, events listings, and so on. 

Idea Bears Fruit. The original idea of linking messages to- 
gether in a nonlinear way came to John James two years ago 
when he was trying to devise a logical, organized way of an- 
swering the many questions people were asking him via mo- 
dem about the Forth programming language. He began work- 
ing in earnest about a year ago and succeeded in completing 
the first version of the CommunlTree software about four 
months later. 

James says that he chose to program the conference tree in 
Forth because it's a flexible language that allows simple logic 
to prevail and makes good use of limited memory. The plan 
later on is to make information available to CommunlTree 
software owners that will enable them to modify their systems 
or to take advantage of new options suggested by users of the 
first edition software. This seems fitting since the tree is, after 
all, a growing thing. 

Also of primary concern in the development of Communl- 
Tree was that the medium be friendly to the user or, as Dean 
Gengle puts it, "disarming, without being frivolous." Before 
marketing the system, members of the CommunlTree group 
experimented to see how people responded to it. They tested 
the system on friends, mostly people in the humanities and fine 
arts who were not knowledgeable about computers. The learn- 
ing curve of these Inexperienced users averaged about fifteen 
minutes. 

Part of the CommunlTree group's philosophy is that those 
who are knowledgeable about computers and about the kinds 



of changes that are being brought about in people's lives have 
an obligation — in essence, to help us all greet the next century 
with vigor a decade or so before It pounces upon us. In an age 
when untold amounts of social change are being unleashed on 
society, responsible, nonthreatenlng dissemination of helpful 
information is what's needed. The group doesn't like the idea of 
packaging information in a slick, glossy fashion that may be 
designed more to impress or Intimidate than to educate ; they 
strive Instead to produce materials that are inviting and sim- 
ple in format. 

The Making of Experts. The conference trees accessed by 
users are sources of information, but they differ considerably 
from the centralized information sources you may have used, 
the most well known of which is probably The Source, a facil- 
ity that provides Information to users for a fee. CommunlTree 
sees its role differently. Its purpose is to serve as a free-two- 
way medium, one that allows people to give Information as 
well as to get it and to Interact with one another in the process. 
The emphasis is on participation and exchange. Unlike The 
Source, a centralized resource you may turn to when you re- 
quire specialized information, CommunlTree is an evolving in- 
formation resource users help to create and maintain. 

Growing Your Own. A new seedling tree Includes a help 
file, a comments file in which users can leave messages or ask 
for assistance, and a calendar file in which current events can 
be listed. According to Gengle, some seventy-two Communl- 
Tree software packages are "out there in the universe." All 
are capable of becoming trees. 

Some of the conference trees that have already been estab- 
lished are private, used by individuals and businesses to com- 
municate among themselves. Examples of such trees are the 
one in operation at a Stowe, Vermont high school, and another 
at the University of Miami, Florida. Some of the other confer- 
ence trees that have grown up since July are intended for pub- 
lic access. These Include installations in Victoria, Texas; Hay- 
ward, California; and Kotzebue, Alaska. 

Linking the World Together. CommunlTree organizers be- 
lieve that, as computers become more commonplace, people 
will begin to focus on local Issues as well as global ones. This is 
in keeping with the spirit of the first World Futures Confer- 
ence held in Toronto, Canada, in July of 1980, the theme of 
which was "thinking globally, acting locally." 

When people decide to establish new trees, no one at Com- 
munlTree attempts to direct them toward emphasizing any 
particular subject area or application. People's areas of pri- 
mary interest, concern, and expertise will emerge over time. 
This aspect of CommunlTree 's attitude is based in a way of 
thinking known as bloregionallsm. 

According to bloregionallsm, certain flora and fauna bloom 
best in certain bioreglons, amid certain conditions and certain 
soils. The same thing applies when it comes to the abilities/af- 
finities of various communities for gathering certain kinds of 
information. Local communities are thought to be much bet- 
ter equipped than outside experts to recognize their own spe- 
cial needs and to develop strategies for dealing with them. And 
often, as a result of having been especially Interested in or con- 
cerned about a certain area, a local community becomes a sort 
of specialized information source that other communities can 
draw upon.

public have a special name — flagship — and serve a special 
function. Located in major metropolitan areas, these flagship 
trees are part of a communications network the Ctommuni- 
Tree group envisions will include forty trees eventually. Com- 
muniTree will have an open channel to each of these flagship 
trees, through which vital information can be transmitted to 
all users within the network. The flagships will be linked to- 
gether later on by a national flagship, the main purpose of 
which is to provide users with information and access num- 
bers for each of the regional flagship trees. 

People who approach the CommunlTree group with ideas 
are given assistance in making their ideas reality. If they want 
to create a flagship and their proposal is accepted, they re- 
ceive the CommunlTree software free, along with gxiidance 
from the CommunlTree group. They, in turn, enter into an 
agreement that allows the CommunlTree group to make use of 
a portion of the message space available on the new tree for six 
months. This allows CommunlTree to continue to learn about 
the medium they've originated, and establishes a link between 
the group and founders of new trees that all concerned find val- 
uable. 

The trees already in operation provide good examples of 
bioregionalism in action. The Victoria, Texas, flagship sup- 
ports a special interest in rockets and private enterprise in 
space, while the Palo Alto flagship specializes in disseminat- 
ing health information for the disabled. Alaska's newly emerg- 
ing flagship supplies information about Alaska to interested 
persons, as well as providing a communication structiore for 
Alaskans themselves. 

Active Voice. Central to the philosophy underlying Com- 
munlTree is the belief that we can and must actively shape our 
future, rather than sit back and let it happen to us. Communl- 
Tree is meant to be as "humanistic and nonauthoritarian" as 
possible and is intended as a means by which we can mobilize 
our energy and intelligence on our own behalf. 

Members of the CommunlTree group radiate an energy 



and thoughtful optimism in the face of what they see as a cri- 
sis more serioxis than any we've ever come up against. They 
see "tapping into our own stores of personal and collective 
creativity" as "the most urgent need of our culture at this junc- 
ture of evolution" and are doing all they can to promote this 
process. 

They, like Buckminster Fuller, to whom the CommunlTree 
is dedicated, believe that our economy is now based on energy 
rather than gold, and that energy consists primarily of infor- 
mation and Imagination. Information and ideas are wealth. 

Sharing information and ideas and discussing issues with 
other concerned people are seen as means of creating our own 
knowledge base. An outgrowth of such activity, say the Com- 
munlTree cofounders, may be that instead of turning to the so- 
called experts for answers, we'll recog^ze our own capacity to 
solve problems and become experts ourselves. 

As Dean Gengle expresses it, "Human ingenuity, imagina- 
tion, and enthusiasm are our most abundant and precious re- 
sources." Each one of us can and must participate in "healing 
the planet." The CommunlTree system offers people a power- 
ful avenue through which to discover their own competence, 
and a means of tapping into, contributing to, and mobilizing 
this bank of creative energy. 

CommunlTree emphasizes our capacity to work together to 
solve problems and our abundant resources for doing so. It 
suggests that we share our riches, our wealth of ideas, rather 
than hoard them. 

Because this way of thinking represents the antithesis of the 
scarcity orientation many of us were taught, we may feel un- 
easy about it at first. But the outcome of actions based in this 
philosophy is bound to be a positive one — an informa- 
tion/imagination exchange in which everybody wins.

THE MOST 

EXCITING MATH PROGRAM 
EVER DEVELOPED. 



A boW daim, yes. 

But we believe so strongly in this system we'll send it to you without your 
risking a thing. Try it, check it out, convince yourself it works. 

If you like it, we'll bill you. If you don't then just send it back. You're not 
obligated at alL 

It's exciting because it works. It actually teaches mathematics. It will even 
introduce new concepts. 

Fancy graphics and sound? No. Mathware works through carefully 
constructed questions that produce conceptual understanding. It works 
through immediate, accurate feedback. And it works because the computer is 
asking the right question at the right time at the right level for each student 

MATHWARE is the result of thousands of student hours of use and 
research. Most important it is developed by MATH CITY, a leading educational 
service specializing in math instruction.

The High-Resolution Color Monitor 

for Apple II 





Amdek's new Color-ll monitor with DVM interface board 



No video monitor has ever combined Apple 11 compati- 
bility with exceptional performance like the new 13" 
Color-ll monitor from Amdek. 

Color-ll features our optional new DVM peripheral board 
for easy interfacing with your Apple II. And look at the 
other top-of-the-line features Color-ll offers: 

• RGB, TTL input for high resolution graphics. 

• 80 X 24 character display capability (with expansion 
card by Vydec). 

• 560 (H) X 260 (V) resolution. 

• Molded-in carrying handle for easier portability. 

• Front-mounted controls for faster fine-tuning. 

So if you want to get the most from your Apple 11 
system, get the "most" monitor. Ask your dealer about 
Amdek's new Color-ll monitor with the optional DVM 
interface board. 



What is DVM? The DVM, or "Digital Video Multiplexor/' 
is a low cost interfacethat allows the Apple II computer 
to be used with an RGB monitor, such as our Color-ll. 

Amdek's DVM is software programmable to allow trans- 
parent operation, and is parallel with existing Apple 
text and graphic modes. Three of its channels are used to 
multiplex the existing Apple text, low resolution and high 
resolution graphics. The 4th channel allows the use of an 
80 character line video board. 

Our DVM is also color channel software programmable, 
enabling you to turn the three color channels on or off 
by software control. For example, the red and blue 
channel can be turned off when the 80 character 
channel is turned on, resulting in a green phosphor 
video presentation. 

For convenient operation, the DVM board may occupy 
any slot in the Apple II. The DVM also features low-power 
consumption and low-power schottky logic.

Everyone's Guide to Assembly Language, 
Part 17 

Last month, we began a discussion of how to pass variables 
back and forth between Applesoft and machine language pro- 
grams. This month we'll complete the discussion with more 
information on how all types of variables are handled and how 
data can also be passed back to the calling Applesoft program. 

Applesoft Variables. There are six tjTJes of variables in 
Applesoft Basic. These are real, integer, and string variables, 
and their array counterparts. To understand fully how to use 
these variables, we must first take a moment to examine the 
differences between them and how the variables are actually 
stored in the computer. 

Real variables are number values between 10^^ and - 10^^, 
which are very large positive and negative numbers. In addition, 
the values need not be whole numbers; a value such as 1.25 is 
allowed. Integer variables, on the other hand, are limited in mag- 
nitude to the range of -I- 32768 to - 32767. They are also limited 
to whole nvimber values, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on. Values such 
as 1.25 are not allowed. 

Real variables are indicated in Basic by an alphabetic char- 
acter (A to Z) followed by a letter or number (A to Z or 0 to 9). 
Any characters after the first two are ignored when Applesoft 
looks up the value for the variable. Integer variables are similar, 
but the name is suffixed by a percent sign (%). Thus A would 
represent the real variable, whereas A% would represent an 
Integer variable. 

When passing data such as a memory address or a single 
byte value to put in memory. Integer variables would be quite 
adequate and, additionally, would require no conversion in the 
machine language routine. However, it is generally more con- 
venient to the Basic programmer not to have to put the % sign 
in the variable name, and, instead, to convert the value using 
the Applesoft routine "FRMNUM" ($DD67) as described in the 
last issue. For the record, though, I will present an example 
shortly on how to retrieve an integer variable from a calling 
Basic program. 

String variables consist of a series of any legal ASCII char- 
acters, with a maximum length of 255 characters. Strings are 
indicated by a $ suffix to the variable name. 

Any of these variables may be present either singly or in an 
array. Arrays are groupings of variables that use a common 
name and then a delimiting subscript to identify each individual 
element. Array variables are indicated by a pair of parentheses 
following the variable name between which a number or expres- 
sion may be used to specify the desired element. 

You are probably already somewhat familiar with the gen- 
eral points mentioned so far; they're raised not so much to teach 
you about Applesoft variable types as such but rather to set the 



stage for what is to follow, namely how each of these variable 
types is stored within the memory of the Apple computer. 

Memory Maps. Quite some time ago. Assembly Lines pre- 
sented a graphic representation of the memory usage of the com- 
puter. We'd like to revive the topic in the interest of our current 
subject. 

A memory map is used to show the relative placement of 
data within the available memory locations in the computer. 
Recall that there are a total of 65,536 locations available, which 
we identify with hexadecimal addresses of $0000 to $FFFF. 

The chart in figure 1 shows how a normal Apple would be 
shown, with DOS booted and an arbitrary Applesoft program in 
memory. 

In previous articles, the areas shown have been described in 
varying degrees of detail. You'll recall that the area from $C000 
to $CFFF is reserved for the interface card addressing, and that 
Applesoft Basic is stored in ROM, beginning at $D000. The Mon- 
itor ROM begins at $F800. 

A normal Applesoft program starts at $800, with the highest 
available address usually being $9600, which is identified with 
the lower boundary of the Disk Operating System (DOS). 

The area from $300 to $3CF is available for user machine 
language programs. $3D0 to $3FF is reserved for Apple system 
vectors, such as the DOS entry vectors. Zero page, the stack, and 
the input buffer have also been discussed in some detail. 

Since our main concern is in the area of Applesoft variables, 
let's consider a revised map, emphasizing Applesoft programs: 

Figure 2 shows that when an Applesoft program is run, sim- 
ple (nonarray) variables are placed immediately after the end of 
the Basic program, followed by the array variables. Because the 
data for each string variable is ever changing in length, string 
data is stored dynamically at the top of memory, working down. 
The space in between these converging areas is the so-called 
free space of the system. 

Himem: and lomem: are used by the Basic programmer to 
set the upper and lower bounds of variable storage. If not spe- 
cifically declared within the program, these default to the bottom 
of DOS and the end of the Applesoft program, respectively. They 
do not, however, always have to be restricted to these locations. 
It is possible to move lomem: up, or himem: down, so as to set 
aside a portion of memory in the computer that won't be affected 
by the running program. This is done for one or both of two 
reasons. First, to protect either or both of the hi-res display pages 
from variable table encroachment, or, second, to provide a pro- 
tected area for a user's machine language program. 

Now that we know where the information for each variable 
is stored in the computer, let's examine the format of the infor- 
mation for each variable. Within the areas indicated, a variable 
table is constructed that contains the name of the given variable

and its value if the variable is a real or integer. If the variable 
is a string, a pointer is stored that indicates the exact location 
of the string stored at the top of memory and its corresponding 
length (0 to 255 characters). 

Figure 3 summarizes the details of the format for these 
tables. 

Each time a variable is first encountered in a running Apple- 
soft program, an entry in the variable table is made for it. For 
simple variables, Applesoft looks to the pointer at $6B,6C to see 
where the end of the current simple variable table is. It then 
opens up seven bytes for the new variable and puts a block of 
data similar to that shown in figure 3, as is appropriate to the 
type of variable defined. 

Real variables store the value in a logarithmic form, where 
each value is indicated by the exponent and four mantissas. 
Integer variables require only that the high and low order bytes 
of the value be stored. The remaining three positions are unused, 
with dummy zero values placed in the table. It's important to 
note here that, for integer variables, the two-byte representation 
of the value is reversed from what we would normally expect. 
That is to say, the high order byte is placed first, followed by the 
low order byte. 

For strings only three bytes of information are required, 
namely the length and address data mentioned earlier. Again 
the last two positions are filled with dummy zeros. 

It should be evident from this table that the same amount of 
memory is allocated for all simple variable types: there is no 
advantage in specifying integer variables versus reals to save 
memory. This will not be the case with arrays. 

Notice that there are two distinct parts to each seven-byte 
variable entry. The first two bytes define the name, where inci- 
dentally, the high order byte is used in each character to indicate

which of the three variable types (real, integer, or string) that 
entry corresponds to. The last five bytes make up the actual data 
for each variable and consist of either the required numeric 
information or, in the case of a string, the length and address 
information. 

The reason to stress this distinction is that, in examining 
arrays, we notice that it is this five byte block that gets repeated 
a large number of times, depending on the total number of ele- 
ments in the array. 

For arrays, a much larger table needs to be constructed, and 
this is created starting at the address indicated by $6B,6C. 
Whenever a new array is defined, the pointer at $6D,6E is exam- 
ined to determine the end of the current array table, and a new 
entry is made according to the format shown in figure 4. 

In this format, the entry is given a header that gives the 
variable name, followed by an offset value used to determine the 
address of the next array entry, if one is present. The offset is 
encoded in the usual two-byte manner. Following the offset is a 
byte indicating the number of dimensions in the array, after 
which is listed a byte for each dimension stating its size. 
Although not shown in the diagram, each size indicator is a two- 
byte pair, although in this case the high byte is always given 
first. 

Immediately after the header is found the actual data blocks, 
each block consisting of 5, 2, or 3 bytes per array element, 
depending on which variable type is involved. Note that, in this 
case, integer variable arrays do take much less memory than an 
equivalent real array.

As an example, if you were to dimension an array with this 
statement: 

DIM A$(10,10) 

the header block would look like this:

\ / \ /

Where $41,80 are the ASCII values for an A followed by a 
null. High bit is off in the first character, on in the second — 
indicating a string. The next array variable would be found at 
the address of the first name character plus $174. There are two 
dimensions to the array, as indicated by the $02. The $00 $0B 
indicates eleven elements in each dimension of the array. This 
should not be surprising when you recall that ten plus the ze- 
roeth position makes eleven elements. 

Following this header we would find 121 three-byte blocks, 
each indicating the length and address of a string array element, 
if present. 11 x 11 = 121; (121 x 3) + 9 (header) = 372 = 
$174! 

Passing Variables from Applesoft to Machine Lan- 



guage. At this point you may well think that we have strayed 
very far from the topic of machine language programming, and 
have become overly involved with the structure of Applesoft. 
Upon a little reflection, however, it should become apparent that 
we must have some familiarity with how these variables are 
stored if we are to interact successfully with them. 

In either reading or creating Applesoft variables, clearly we 
must handle effectively each component of the data. We must be 
able to identify the name and location of the variable we are 
interested in, and also to modify that information if necessary. 

The tempation at this point might be to take this new-found 
knowledge and write our own routines to accomplish the needed 
operations; but such an undertaking would be quite unneces- 
sary, not to mention likely to have you mindlessly babbling to 
yourself in no time. 

Fortunately, Applesoft already contains all the necessary 
routines to do almost anything we wish. The main trick will be 
to identify properly and use the appropriate ones. 

Last month I made use of a few of these to accomplish a 
certain degree of flexibility in passing numeric data to a machine 
language routine. Let's complete the study by formalizing the 
possible operations. 

The first general category is passing data to a routine. We 
can pass any of six variable types. To minimize the confusion, 
let us establish a fairly simple goal: to pass the data successfully 
and prove so by storing the data in a non- Applesoft location. 

Integer Variables. First for integer variables. The calling 
Applesoft program looks like this: 

10 A% = 258 

20 CALL 768,A% 

30 PRINT PEEK (896),PEEK(897) 

40 REM 896,897 = $380,381 

50 END 

The machine language routine should be assembled from 
this listing:

In this routine, CHKCOM ($DEBE = "check for comma") is 
used to make sure the syntax is correct (that is, a comma), and 
to advance TXTPTR ($B8 = "Text Pointer") to the first byte of 
the variable name being evaluated. Refer to last month's issue 
for the original discussion on these two routines. 




Assembly Lines: The Book has still not been published. 

The calendar and the month of this issue will tell you more eloquently than anything we could say that we missed the scheduled shipping 
date of December 7, 1981 . Perhaps more bothersome to us is that we now have no firm shipping schedule to which we can commit without 
trepidation. 

We feel as though we owe you an explanation for this execrable gaffe of commercial practice and offer the following one for your 
edification: 

No book publishing effort is a trivial one. Under ordinary circumstances, a book publisher schedules twelve to eighteen months from incep- 
tion of a project to shipping date. Roger Wagner and we felt we could significantly cut this lead time, especially considering that the body 
of the book would consist of reprints of his Softalk columns. 

But we hadn't reckoned with the volatility of the Apple market. When we sat down in August to firm up the schedule, Softalk hod just 
finished printing its largest issue to that date — 88 pages. Roger hod four active items in his catalog. We could not foresee that Roger's 
catalog would triple and that Soffalk's size would increase to a peak of 214 pages in December. 

This growth had obvious impact on the book schedule. As dedicated as Roger is to performing faithfully his columnist duties for Soffalk, 
the fact remains that his bread and butter is software publishing. The growth of Southwestern Data Systems in the last four months of 
1 98 1 consumed far more of his time than any reasonable man would have foreseen in August. Likewise, the growth at Softalk obviated the 
possibility of providing additional support for Roger that might have kept him on or near schedule. 
Our shortsightedness was regrettable and we apologize for it. 

Our best efforts are now directed toward bringing you the book as soon as possible. Look for an ad in Softalk soon that will announce a 
firm date. Until this date is announced please do not submit orders. All money remitted will be returned until such time as a definite 
delivery date is established. 

Roger and we express our regrets for the inconvenience and disappointment caused by our inability to deliver as promised and hope that 
it will not change your desire for what we feel will be a valuable addition to your Apple reference library.

PTRGET ($DFE3 = "Pointer Get") is now called, which is 
a subroutine that reads a variable name in and then locates it 
in the variable table. As an added bonus, if the variable named 
does not currently exist in the table, it will create an entry for 
it. This applies to variables of all six types. After returning from 
PTRGET, the address of the value for the variable is held in the 
Y register and the accumulator (low byte, high byte). This thus 
indicates the location in memory of the two to five byte data 
block discussed earlier. The data in the Y register and the accu- 
mulator is also duplicated in VARPNT, VARPNT + 1 ($83,84 
= "Variable Pointer"), which will be used later in the program. 

At this stage it would be a simple matter to use indirect 
addressing to retrieve the two bytes, but a little more effort will 
result in a much more thorough routine. It is possible that the 
user might have called the routine with an improper variable 
type following the CALL statement, such as a string. This can 
be checked for by the next two program steps. 

MOVFM ($EAF9 = "Move to FAC from Memory") will move 
whatever data is pointed to by the Y register and the accumu- 
lator into the floating point accumulator ($F9-A2 = "FAC"). 
The contents can then be checked for variable type by the call 
to CHKNUM ($DD6A = "Check Number"). The presence of a 
string here would yield a "type mismatch error." Unfortunately, 
it is not particularly easy to test for a real variable having been 
mistakenly used here. 

Presuming no error occurs, we will now make use of the data 
saved in VARPNT (since the Y register and accumulator have 
been no doubt altered by MOVFM and CHKSTR) to actually 
retrieve the two byte value passed. The indirect addressing mode 
is now used to move the variable data into our two data bytes. 
The address of $380,381 was in this case arbitrarily chosen for 
the example. 

It is important to note that special care is used in lines 25 
and 28, since integer variables store the two data bytes high 
order first, as mentioned earlier. This is opposite to the normal 
6502 convention. 

This routine will work equally well for retrieving data from 
simple integer variables and from integer array variables. 

When you run this example, the numbers two and one should 
be printed out, these being the low and high order bytes of the 
number passed top the routine (258 = $102). 

Real Variables. Once in machine language, the handling 
of floating point numbers, such as represented by real variables 
is somewhat involved. Additionally, the majority of the time you 
will be concerned only with passing an integer between 0 and 
65535. Therefore, we will consider here how lo use a real vari- 
able to pass a number in this range to a given subroutine. 

This revision of our first Applesoft program will do the trick: 

10 A = 258 
20 CALL 768,A 

30 PRINT PEEK(896),PEEK(897) 
40 REM 896,897 = $380,381 
50 END

This is basically a repeat of last month's routine, with the 
results being put in DATA,DATA-I- 1. The advantage of this 
routine is not only that it is shorter, but that it will accept either 
integer or real variables (simple or array), and still do the string 
error check. This then is usually the preferred method. 

String Variables. The goal here will be to read some string 
data from the calling Applesoft program and then to put it some- 
where in memory, where it would presumably be available to 
other portions of the machine language program. To illustrate 
this, enter the following two programs: 

10 A$ = "TEST"

FEBRUARY 1982 



The routine starts off rather like the previous ones by using 
CHKCOM to make sure a comma was used after the CALL and 
to prepare TXTPTR for reading in the data. FRMEVL ($DD78 
= "Formula Evaluation") is a very nice general purpose routine 
that takes in virtually any numeric or string expression or lit- 
eral, and places the final result in FAC. It is related to 
FRMNUM, but is much more omnivorous. Upon returning from 
FRMEVL, FACMO and FACLO ($A0,A1 = . . sorry, couldn't 
find out where they got the name! . . .") hold the address of the 
string's descriptor, that is, the three-byte group giving the length 
and address of the actual string data. 

Our routine uses FACMO,FACLO in the indirect addressing 
mode to retrieve the first byte of the descriptor, which is the 
length of the string. This is put into the X register for temporary 
storage. Some people would prefer to push it onto the stack with 
a PHA command; it's a matter of choice. Next, the address of the 
string data is retrieved from the descriptor and put into 
VARPNT, which is assumed to be not in use at the time. Last of 
all, we use the VARPNT pointer to move the data from its loca- 
tion, indicated by VARPNT, to our DATA address. 

In experimenting, notice that the area from $380 to $3CF is 
open, but starting at $3D0, the area is reserved for DOS. Enter- 
ing very long strings in the example may lead to some problems. 
In your own programs, it would be necessary to set aside a one 
page area ($100 = 256 bjrtes) to put the data, unless of course 
you can limit the length of the string before doing the call. 

You may also wish to try variations in the Applesoft program 
by deleting line 10 and rewriting line 20 as: 

20 CALL 768, "ABC" + "DEF" 



or 



or 



20 CALL 768,LEFT$("ABCDEF") 



10 
20 



A$(5,5) = "TEST" 
CALL 768,A$(5,5) 



Passing Data from Machine Language to Applesoft 
Variables. The converse of the techniques we've discussed so 
far is actually fairly simple. The key to much of it is the PTRGET 
routine used earlier. Because this routine will even create a 
variable when it's not already present, we can simply more or 
less reverse the process of the previous routines to pass data 
back to a calling Applesoft program. 

Again, I'll illustrate an example for each variable type. 

Integer Variables. The Applesoft program: 

10 POKE 896,2: POKE 897,1 

20 CALL 768,A% 

30 PRINT A% 

40 END

This program is a rather trivial exercise in that all that needs 
to be done is to reverse the operands of lines 24,25 and 27,28 
from the first Integer Reader program. Again, the only caution 
is to make sure the bytes are transferred in the proper order, 
since integer data is reversed. 

Real Variables. Real variables require the introduction of 
a few new routines. The same Applesoft calling program is used 
with only a minor modification.

The technique here is to use the routine GIVAYF ($E2F2 
= "Give Accumulator and Y Register to FAC") to put the two 
b5rtes of our integer number into the FAC. GIVAYF requires 
that the accumulator and Y register be loaded with the low and 
high order bytes, respectively, for the integer number to be 
transferred. As an added bonus, the number may even be signed, 
that is, positive or negative. Signed binary numbers were briefly 
touched on in an earlier issue and are covered in greater detail 
in the book version of this series. 

Lines 19 and 20 load the appropriate registers, and, after 
calling GIVAYF, PTRGET and CHKSTR are used to determine 
the name of the variable to use in returning the data. Recall that 
after returning from PTRGET, the Y register and accvunulator 
will hold the low and high order bjiies of the address of the data 
for the new variable digested by PTRGET. 

MOVMF ($EB2B = "Move to Memory from FAC") is the 
routine we'll use to complete the process. It requires that the Y 
register and X register be loaded with the address of the memory

location to which the contents of the FAC will be moved. Since 
PTRGET has just determined that for us, the only hitch is that 
PTRGET left the high order byte in the accumulator instead of 
the X register as we require. A simple TAX solves that problem, 
and the routine is concluded with the call to MOVMF and an 
RTS. 

Programming Tip. Whenever a routine ends with a JSR to 
another routine, immediately followed by the ending RTS of the 
main routine, the line can be shortened one byte by changing 
the last JSR to a JMP. When the RTS in the last called subrou- 
tine is encountered, the RTS will cause an exit from the main 
routine instead. An example of this would be to rewrite the end 
of the program just listed as: 



030F: 20 6A DD 23 JSR CHKNUM 

24 * Y,A = ADDR OF VAR DATA 

0312: AA 25 TAX 

0313: 4C 2B EB 26 DONE JMP MOVMF 



VAR = $? 



PUT FAC -> MEMORY 
AND RETURN! 



String Variables. String variables are not much different 
but will require a slightly clumsy calling Applesoft program to 
demonstrate. Line 10 is a series of pokes that will put the ASCII 
data for the string "TEST" into memory at our usual DATA 
($380) location. Additionally, a delimiter will be placed at the 
end of the string so that the routines we will be calling can 
determine the string's length. Use of a delimiter is more prac- 
tical especially in situations where you don't know the length of 
an incoming string until the carriage return or other delimiter 
shows up. The Applesoft routine we'll be using will automati- 
cally determine the length by scanning the string for the delim- 
iter.

and SAVD ($DA9A = "Save descriptor"). MAK$ requires that 
the accumulator and the Y register hold the address (low, high) 
of the string to be scanned and that the X register hold the value 
for the delimiting character. This example uses '00', but another 
common variation would be to use a carriage return ($8D) or a 
comma ($2C). (Note that return is almost always found in the 
input buffer with the high bit set, that is, $8D versus $0D). 

After scanning for the delimiter, MAK$ moves the data up 
to the string storage area at the top of memory. 

SAVD is a companion routine which will take whatever 
string descriptor is currently pointed to by FORPNT ($85,86 = 
"Formula Pointer(?)"), and match it to the data just moved by 
MAK$. 

Looking at the listing, we can see that the only creative work 
needing to be done is to move the contents of A and Y to 
FORPNT. The A, Y, and X registers are then prepared as was 
just described, and the remaining calls are done. Voila! Instant 
strings! 

Closing Stuff. You'll notice that all of the routines handle 
arrays as well as simple variables. Additionally, certain more 
subtle points become apparent as you study the listings. For 
example, each of the last three Applesoft listings was done with- 
out defining the returned variable prior to the call. This was to 
demonstrate that PTRGET does a very nice job of creating the 
variable for us. In addition, in each case, the data that was put 
into a variable and then later retrieved at DATA (and vice versa) 
should be consistent, thus demonstrating the accuracy of the 
methods. 

You may also wish to experiment with using formulas or 
string calculations after the call statement to confirm that all 
legal Applesoft operations are acceptable. 

Last but not least, I would like to give credit and thanks to 
Craig Peterson for his help in providing some of the information 
used in preparing this article. 

Next month, we'll look at some other applications of internal 
Applesoft routines within custom machine language programs.

□ Just Waiting for a Bus. The field re- 
search teams of Southwest Research In- 
stitute's applied physics division, special- 
izing in the problems of plant dynamics, 
structural design and analysis, materials 
engineering, and noise analysis and con- 
trol, are ready to go anywhere in the 
world on twenty-four hours notice. A 
typical field package would include a 
multi-channel vibration/pulsation trans- 
ducer amplifier, a strain gauge amplifi- 
er, proximetric pickups, a spectrum 
analyzer for amplitude and phase data — 
and, recently, an Apple II Plus micro. 

The entry of the Apple into the world 
of on-site field data analysis was made 
possible by the ability of new- model spec- 
trum analyzers — last link in the 
measurement chain — to output to an 
IEEE 488 general purpose instrument 
bus, allowing on-site computer analysis 
of retrieved data and eliminating the 
necessity of plotting the final data or 
reading its amplitude and phase compo- 
nents from a CRT. 

Larry Blodgett, SwRI's senior re- 
search assistant, wanted a computer that 
met criteria of flexibility and portability 
(field equipment has to stand up to Amer- 
ican Tourister-type simian baggage 
handlers), and, when he read of the ca- 
pability of SSM's A488 card to turn an Ap- 
ple into an IEEE 488 bus controller, he 
knew he'd found what he was looking for. 

When the applied physics teams run 
tests now, they put all the acquired 
spectra into an Apple via the A488 for im- 
mediate access and computation, and 
also store on disk for use in the lab. 
Blodgett is pleased. They have three 
Apple/A488 combinations, and "we're al- 
ready thinking about a half-dozen more." 

□ Review Preview. In James Martin's 
The Telematic Society (Marketalk Re- 
views, January 1982) it was futuristic 
speculation. But at CBS at the start of the 
1981-82 television season, cast and crew 
of the new "Simon and Simon" series 
gathered in the Hollywood offices of pro- 
ducer Phil DeGuere to get immediate 
feedback on their first show, via comput- 
er. The telecommunicated criticism 
came from the east coast, before the 
show had even aired in its western time 
zone. DeGuere is one of the fourteen 
thousand subscribers to the Source, a na- 
tional network of information services. 

About one hundred subscribers re- 
sponded the first week ("They told us to 
speed up the plot a bit and increase the 
sibling rivalry between Rick and A. J."), 
two hundred the second, and, according 
to DeGuere, "We should soon equal the 



total Nielsen sample of 1,250. When you 
consider that Nielsen ratings don't even 
tell us if viewers actually watch the show 
or care about it— well, I think this use of 
The Source has significant potential for 
involving viewers in the upgrading of 
television programming." 

□ Arcade Brigade. It was boimd to hap- 
pen sooner or later. The popular video 
games of the kind that require players to 
shoot down enemy aircraft and blow up 
tanks may soon be used as a training de- 
vice for future soldiers in the United 
States Army. And the arcade galleries 
that attract so many draft-age young 
men who eagerly drop quarters in ma- 
chines for the privilege of participating in 
war simulations could be tiomed into re- 
cruitment centers. 

However farfetched it might sound for 
the army to be using video games as a 
new secret weapon — of sorts — ^take heed. 
The army is taking the games seriously. 
It has already commissioned one of the 
largest video companies to produce a 
game that would simulate a specific kind 
of army infantry carrier. 

Captain Stephen Cox of the U.S. Army 
was quoted in the San Francisco Chroni- 
cle as sajdng the games would be used as 
a supplement to regular training. Since 
today's soldiers were raised on televi- 
sion, video games may prove a better 
way to train them than the hundreds of 
manuals now in use. Although plans for 
recruiting soldiers in mall arcades are 
still vague, several high-ranking of- 
ficials in the army are not discounting 
this possibility. According to Cox, kids 
who can get a six-figure score right off 
the bat on a war game have the correct 
hand-eye coordination to have a "bright 
future" losing the real thing. 

□ And There Was Light. James G. 
Burke, general manager of Optimem, 
called laser-based optical disk drives the 
wave of the future at the Dataquest 
Computer Industry Memory Conference 
in San Diego. Burke stated that optical 
drives will offer the potential for "drama- 
tic improvement in storage perfor- 
mance and capability, whose potential

developing an optical disk drive recorder 
for the OEM marketplace. Media improve- 
ments will eventually allow erasabili- 
ty; currently, key features are remov- 
ability, allowing disks to be removed 
safely for off-line storage, and dis- 
tributability, allowing optical storage 
users to make a nickel master and stamp 
out as many copies an needed, similar to 
record album production. 

□ Let's Get Physical. Fitness Systems, a 
six-year-old Los Angeles based company 
currently providing "managed fitness 
facilities" to Dart and Kraft, Shaklee, 
Teledyne, and Times Mirror Co., has 
devised CompuFit, a computerized, in- 
dividualized fitness program designed 
for employees who don't have access to a 
gym. Atlantic Richfield of Los Angeles 
has been the first large client to take ad- 
vantage of the program, which ARCO of- 
ficials are monitoring with an eye toward 
expansion throughout the company. 

Based on each participant's fitness 
data sheet, a computerized profile com- 
pares participants' fitness to the de- 
sirable established mean for their sex 
and age group, then devises the appro- 
priate conditioning and exercise regimen 
for each individual. After four months, 
the original series of fitness tests is ad- 
ministered again and the participant 
receives a new fitness profile to compare 
with the first. 

The program, while unsupervised and 
not providing actual facilities, is mainly 
of benefit in that it is available to all 
employees of a company. 

□ Fun with Music. Dr. Timothy Kolo- 
sick, of the North Texas State Uni- 
versity School of Music, has received a 
grant from the NTSU Faculty Research 
Committee to investigate the potential 
for generation of music graphics on 
terminals not originally designed for it. 
NTSU's CAI lab will store musical nota- 
tion symbols in EPROM chips for the 
project, allowing fast, sophisticated, and 
cost-efficient representation of music 
graphics, necessary for a complete in- 
structional music system. 

□ The Basest Data. Product planning 
and marketing consultant David Ferris, 
speaking at last November's Mini/Micro 
show in Anaheim, California, comment- 
ed that most data base management sys- 
tems for personal computers are "little 
more than elementary ISAM file 
organizations, with no real understand- 
ing of such major issues for the software 
professional as relatability and multi- 
user concurrent access." 

Citing limited edit masks and valida- 
tion criteria for screen definition, Ferris 
felt that utiUties such as query systems, 
report writers, screen formatters, and 
data dictionaries are still rudimentary 
and generally lack the facilities needed 
by programmers to build an integrated 
set of applications programs. Ferris not- 
ed that resistance of data processing 
managers to the introduction of the per- 
sonal computer into business is to be ex- 
pected but they will be forced to accept it 



I Anr| ^ 

because departmental users of personal 
computers running standalone applica- 
tions are demanding access to data proc- 
essing developed applications and the 
corporate data base. 

Noting that "as people attempt to 
build an integrated portfolio of pro- 
grams around a central data base, life 
suddenly gets much, much harder," 
Ferris dismissed the belief in the micro 
community that mainframe data pro- 
cessing departments are incompetent be- 
cause of the long times and high costs as- 
sociated with new applications develop- 
ment in that environment, predicting 
that the micro world will soon have the 
same problems. 

□ Direct to Disk. Digital radiology, a 
technique for converting x-ray images 
into electronic signals and storing them 



133 

in a computer, allowing doctors to see 
more at less cost and less risk to the 
patient, is taking the medical world by 
storm. 

In the process, x-rays of a diseased 
region are fed into a computer/digital 
image processor where they are con- 
verted into number coded shades of gray. 
Multiplying all the numbers by ten, the 
computer darkens the dark areas, 
lightens the light areas, and brings the 
image into sharp contrast. Image proces- 
sing technology is now precise enough to 
track minute changes in blood vessels. 

Especially valuable in tracking stroke 
and heart disease, the technique in- 
volves less radiation than the conven- 
tional x-ray and saves the cost of a hospi- 
tal stay, as it can usually be performed in 
thirty to forty minutes. JM

Fantasy 

(HKISTOPHEK U. LICHT 

My Old Flame. My Apple's case is 
coffee-stained. Its keys are dusty. 
There's a permanent black smudge be- 
low the space bar where my right thumb 
rests while I'm thinking. It's middle-aged 
as Apple ns go, one of the first of the float- 
ing-point Plus models with that con- 
founded, unprotected, misplaced, and 
thoroughly miserable reset key Just 
above the return key. (For those of you 
new to Appledom, the older models didn't 
have the protection of requiring control 
along with reset to prevent accidental 
bombing of programs and disks) . It's on 
its second monitor and second printer, 
third set of game paddles, and fifth set of 
buttons. It's barely two years old. 

In addition to growing long of tooth, 
my Apple has put on a fair amount of 
weight. Slot 0 has an Integer card, slot 1 a 
printer interface, slot 3 an ALF music 
synthesizer, slots 4 and 5 the Mountain 
Computer MusicSystem, and slot 6 the 
disk drive card with both DOS 3.2 and 3.3 
chips.

DithcrtizGi 




...the eye oF 
your apple: 



Though it is very simple to use, the Dithertizer II represents 
the ultimate in video digitizing using the Apple II 
computer. The Dithertizer is on interface card which 
converts video input into digitized images. Because the 
Dithertizer II is a frame grabber, DMA type digitizer, it 
offers extreme high speed in the conversion process (it 
grabs an entire frame in 1/60th of a second). The camera 
supplied with the package is the Sanyo model VC1610X. 
Cabling is supplied for this camera so as to hove the 
Dithertizer II system up and running in minutes. The video 
camera used for input must have external sync to allow 
for the frame grabber technology employed for digitizing. 
If a camera other than the model recommended is used, 
wiring adaptations by the user may be required. Software 
is supplied with the board to allow you to display up to 64 
pseudo grey levels on your Apple's screen. The number 
of grey levels may be changed with one keystroke. The 
intensity and contrast of the image are controllable via 
game paddles. Also supplied is software for image 
contouring for those interested in movement detection 
or graphic design applications. 



The Dithertizer II package Is available ready 
to run with camera, Interface card and 
the software described above for only: 



$650. 



and two disk drives. Next to the computer itself is an Epson 
MX -80 printer. In a drawer under the printer is a Dan Paymar 
Lower Case Adapter that I hadn't gotten around to installing 
when On-Line Systems announced a word processor vdth soft- 
ware-generated lower-case letters. 

Although my system's certainly much more than a 16K ma- 
chine with cassette storage, it can't be called elaborate. As I 
look through the magazine ads at Apple peripherals that I 
don't have, I drool. In fact, while this system grew over these 
two years to meet my own specialized needs, I susect that, ex- 
cept for the music cards, it's a pretty typical system. It's like- 
ly to be typical because it grew as a compromise between my 
professional needs, my children's school needs, and my four- 
teen-year-old boy's love of arcade games. 

For the first year and a half, we carried the Apple between 
home, office, and summer cottage. Packing it to take to the 
lake for the summer, I realized that it filled seven boxes, in- 
cluding one for software (the grey notebook has word proces- 
sor files; the brown one, utility programs; the fat red one, 
games, and so on) . 

I also realized that, because it had been at the office, my chil- 
dren hadn't had much chance to use it recently. My daughter, 
who was studying Basic at school, couldn't do her homework at 
home. My boy was forced to spend his allowance on Pac-Man 
at a local arcade parlor. If I wanted to work in the evening, I 
had to go back to my office. Clearly it was time for a second 
computer. 

So Many Others Who Had Fascinating Ways. Which com- 
puter should I get? I mulled the pros and cons of having to get 
all new software versus the lower cost of a TRS-80 which, I 
thought, would be just fine for the kids. My boy wanted Mat- 
tell's Intellivision, which he thinks has the best action games. I 
vetoed that because the computer module wasn't available yet 
(and, it appears, may never be). 

It seemed to make sense to get the most advanced and flexi- 
ble "state of the art" machine I could find and add memory 
and peripherals as I could afford them. In my heart, of course, 
I knew I had to have an Apple III with its 128K of memory. Of 
course, this would be my machine at the office, and the kids 
would get the old II Plus with that exposed reset key. The price 
was a lot steeper than I wanted, but I reminded myself that it 
would be a business machine at my office, and I could write off 
its cost and recover a portion through very legitimate tax 
deductions. 

But, I decided, I'd better make a proper search. After all, if 
I made the wrong selection, I'd be stuck with it for a couple of 
years. My first computer had turned out to be a horrible 
choice. It was a Heathkit H-8 with an H-9 terminal, both of 
which I built over one long, cold, Chicago winter. When I fin- 
ished, I found that the operating manual was so badly writ- 
ten that I had to call the factory to find out how to boot the sys- 
tem and that the only preprogrammed software available con- 
sisted of Basic and half a dozen games, all on cassette tape. 

It ran intermittently, and I felt pleased if I could get a good 
cassette load in less than five tries. The day the terminal 
caught fire was the day I decided to trade it in for an Apple. 
Unfortunately, no Apple dealer wanted it. Would you buy a 
used Heathkit that somebody else had put together? I 
wouldn't. After another year of using a pocket calculator, a 
manual typewriter, and a wooden chess board, I gave the H-8, 
H-9, and about ten pounds of unintelligible manuals to Good- 
will and started over again with an Apple. Since I didn't want 
another expensive disaster like that, I planned to search care- 
fully before committing myself to another system. 

Luckily, searching would be easy. Within a ten minute walk 
from my office are a DEC store (Digital Equipment Compa- 
ny—remember the PDP 11?), a Xerox dealer, two Radio 
Shacks (there's one on every comer), and an Apple dealer. I 
decided not to bother with all those obscure names you see ad- 
vertised ad infinitum in Byte. 

It was easy to eliminate the Xerox and DEX:; machines. The 
first tximed out to be a word processor only, and the second 
was simply too expensive and was limited to DEC'S own soft- 
ware. Radio Shack's TRS-80s, however, were appealing

(heresy!) . There was a lot of software available, and the price 
seemed right. In addition, the Model II, which was designed for 
business, had an eight-inch, built-in disk drive as well as a 
built-in monitor. Maybe its battleship-grey wouldn't comple- 
ment my office as well as Apple's light beige, but that seemed 
minor. I promised the salesman I'd think about it and took 
home a catalog to study, but I knew in my heart when I did it 
that I really had to have that 128K Apple III. Besides, as a 
shareholder of Apple Computer Inc., I had to support my com- 
pany, didn't I? 

Before I had a chance to get a proper demonstration of the 
III, a friend asked, "Did you see the Wall Street Journal arti- 
cle about the Apple III?" I hadn't, so I went to the library to 
look it up. As a loyal Apple owner, you've probably heard of 
that article even if you didn't read it. Appearing in the Jour- 
nal's April 15, 1981, issue, it documented the woes of the Apple 
III. There were basically two problems when it was intro- 
duced: (1), its quality control was apparently abysmal, and 
early owners could expect breakdowns and repairs as a matter 
of course ; (2) , Apple introduced this 128K computer, then the 
largest micro in the industry, with virtually no software ex- 
cept Basic and VisiCalc. Worse, the article went on, it would be 
almost another year before much additional software would be 
available. While at the library, I checked on the price of my 
Apple stock and found that it had fallen by a dollar and a half a 
share the day that story came out. 

Nevertheless, I decided to ask my neighborhood Apple deal- 
er for a demonstration. The III looked nice, and its separate 
numerical keypad and (hooray) recessed reset button were 
great additions. He showed me VisiCalc and acknowledged 
that there was nothing else just then. I asked about running my 
Apple II software. He said some of the programs would run in 
the "emulator" mode and some wouldn't but that he didn't 
know which ones would and also that this mode then limited 
the III to the n's 48K. 

I asked about peripheral boards, and he replied that he 
didn't know whether or not any of them were compatible elec- 



137 



trically. In any case, he said, they probably wouldn't fit physi- 
cally because the Ill's case is shaped differently. Scratch my 
music synthesizers. Then I noticed that the III had only one 
built-in disk drive. The dealer said that a Disk II sitting on the 
table next to the model HI served as the second drive. I was 
aghast. There are only two correct numbers of disk drives for a 
micro computer: zero, if you want to keep the initial cost down, 
and two, if it's to be a $5,000 business system like the Apple III 
purports to be. 

No wonder the price of my stock had gone down. The Apple 
III was the Edsel of the eighties. 

I shook my head and packed up my old II Plus for its an- 
nual trip to the lake. Over the summer I heard a fantastic ru- 
mor: the Founding Father was going to bring out a micro with 
256K that you could buy at your local Sears Roebuck store. 
Nonsense, I thought, but in the fall it turned out to be true — ex- 
cept that you had to go to a special Sears Business Center or a 
Computerland store. 

Right after the Midwest computer show in late September, 
I drove to a Computerland out In the suburbs to look at this 
latest miracle from IBM. There it was in typewriter grey with 
a matching monitor, a printer that looked Just like my Epson 
(which makes them for IBM) and two — count 'em, two — built- 
in disk drives. It was sitting on the table this dealer used to use 
for his Apple III demonstrator. I asked him where the III was, 
and he replied, "We don't keep one on display any more, but 
we do have one in the back room in case somebody Insists on 
bujang it." I l^ad a horrible vision of my stock slipping even 
lower. 

I turned to the IBM. After I had watched the continuous 
sales pitch that it was running finish up and start over again, I 
asked if I could look at something else, perhaps IBM's Visir 
Calc. The salesman apologized: sorry, no software. I pointed to 
IBM's sales brochure, which promised Basic, VisiCalc, and 
Adventure. "We wish we had them," he replied. I asked how 
he could sell IBM's without software any better than Apple His 
without software. He shrugged and I left.

FEBRUARY 1982 



The Edsel has become a Mustang. 

Barely a month and a half ago, Apple Computer Inc. re- 
leased a new, Improved version of the Apple III that has great- 
ly expanded memory and mass-storage capability and profes- 
sional application programs. The original Apple III had a 
tough act to follow after Its older sisters. Apples II and II Plus, 
changed the world of personal computing. So when some vo- 
cal consumers uncovered flaws in the original system, the Ap- 
ple III suddenly became a lemon. 

The New Baby. This Is not intended to be a redeeming 
essay on the merits of the original Apple III; at first, it was a 
lemon. But, for the record, the system Softalk acquired several 
months ago, one of the last original Ills, has proven absolutely 
flawless. And it goes through a rigorous test at this office, 
working straight through periods of forty-eight hours and more 
without hesitation. But a bad reputation is hard to change in a 
single essay, so suffice it to say, our Apple III has a secure 
place in our office and we're glad we adopted It. 

But now Apple Computer Inc. has a new baby, which they 
have named the new Apple III. Apple President Mike Mark- 
kula says tests haye proven it to be even more reliable than the 
Apple n, despite being a much more complex machine than its 
predecessor. The new Apple III packs an improved operating 
system, fully reliable hardware, and up to 266K of internal 
memory. All this and it is even lower priced than the earlier 
Apple III. Owners of original Apple III systems — such as 
Softalk'B — can upgn^ade to the new version at no charge, even if 
the warranty has expired. 

Rattles, Teddy Bears, and Other Toys. One of the major 
complaints about the original Apple III system was that there 
was no software, or at least very little, available for it. A per- 
sonal computer owner can be compared somewhat to a new 
Barbie doll owner who demands lots of thlngfs to dress it up 
with and lots of peripherals to buy. 

The new Apple III has seven new or enhanced software 
packages from Apple alone, but the most exciting supporting 
package is hardware: the new Apple III/ProFile Personal 



Mass-Storage System. As far as desirability, the ProFile Mass- 
Storage System is like the prom dress in the Barbie wardrobe. 
Designed to be Integrated into Apple III systems, ProFile is a 
five-million- byte, Winchester-type, hard-disk system that 
gives Apple users nearly thirty-five times the mass-storage 
capacity of a single floppy disk. 

A completely self-contained unit, the ProFile features an in- 
telligent controller, a five and a quarter-inch Winchester tech- 
nology disk drive, a power supply, an Interface card, and 
driver software. According to Markkula, "The storage capaci- 
ty of ProFile will bring true database management applica- 
tions to personal computing for the first time. 

"All the data needed to run a small business or a depart- 
ment within a large organization can reside on a single Pro- 
F'ile for easy access, data manipulation, and analysis. Previ- 
ously, the information often had to be stored on many floppy 
disks." 

The Apple III is targeted at traditional 'Apple customers in 
business, professional management, and education. Because 
of its greatly increased mass-storage capacity, the new Apple 
III is also particularly well-suited for OEMs (original eqiip- 
ment manufacturers) and system integrators who need larger 
data capacity. 

Now in Owners can Take Up Running. The seven new or en- 
hanced application programs were also introduced laat De- 
cember. Access III allows Apple III computers to communi- 
cate with large mainframe computers. This is a significant 
breakthrough because, for the first time, Apple Ills can be 
turned into remote data processing work stations, retrieving 
information from the larger database and returning com- 
pleted work to the central computer. 

An Apple Writer III is the old standby Apple Writer ex- 
panded almost beyond recognition and very, very powerful; 
it's main resemblance to its parent is its user-friendly eeuse of 
implementation. VisiCalc III and Business Graphics m pre- 
pare and analyze detailed business information; Business Ba- 
sic and Pascal III offer a choice of languages for developing

So much for 256K. So much for 128K. I called my dealer and 
ordered a second Apple n Plus. It works just fine, and all I have 
to carry between the house and the office are a few disks that 
will run on either machine. 

Still, despite the money I saved, I was disappointed. I'd had 
my heart set on a real number-cruncher. After all, a 256K ma- 
chine was the biggest IBM ever offered in the Model 360 line 
that was the main frame workhorse of the world for over a 
decade. A well-equipped version of it had set some companies 
back more than their corporate jets. For about the price of a 
Volkswagen I could have had the same computing power. But 
IBM's micro had no software, and Apple had built an Edsel. 

So it'll be two, three, maybe even five years before I get my 
own number-cruncher. By then my favorite computer stores 
will have walls covered with software for both the III and the 
Founding Father Junior. But I won't have either one of those. 
Now that I have two Apple lis, I'm going to wait for the Apple 
IV. 

In fact, I've already got my Apple IV system pretty well 
planned out if my company, Apple Computer Inc. (as a stock- 
holder, I am a part owner, you know) Introduces the Model IV 
that I hope it will introduce. I'm already having visions of what 
it will be like. 

My Thoughts Go Flashing Back Again. Although I suspect 
that technology will further reduce the size of circuit boards 
and electrical components, the Apple IV that I see visions of 
when I close my eyes will be somewhat larger than the Apple 
Hi The human finger just isn't going to shrink, so the keyboard 
can't be smaller. In addition, my IV will need the physical 
space for music boards and clocks and all already developed 
for the II. 

My Apple IV's case will, of course, be beige with a rain- 
bowed, prechewed apple logo: no black or grey for my compa- 
ny, not when its image is so strong that peripheral manufac- 
turers are making printers and monitors in the same color to

Gifts from the Relatives. These new application programs 
and memory expansion capabilities promise to make Apple III 
owners as well as computer dealers happy and satisfied, but 
this isn't where it ends. In keeping with Apple Inc.'s estab- 
lished but highly unusual policy, the Apple III is wide open to 
the programmer's curious probing; and so the software from 
outside publishers that's begun to trickle onto the market is 
likely to become a torrent as the reliability of the new system 
becomes widely known. 

As of January 1, outside companies had produced at least 
four word processors, five accounting packages, an outstand- 
ing memo calendar, and a working clock just for the III. Other 
publishers have revised Apple II packages to take advantage 
of the Ill's capabilities. And the new III has an enhanced emu- 
lation mode that makes virtually all yqur Apple II software 
workable on the III. 

Someone Else's Children. In 1908, with great fanfare and 
foofara, Ford Motor Ctompany introduced the Edsel; in 1969, 
production on the worst-selling and shortest-lived member of 
the Ford family ceased. In 1964, with some fanfare. Ford Mo- 
tor Company introduced the Mustang; fourteen years later. 
Mustang, the small car with tons of power, still held the all- 
time record for car sales in its first year. Today, Mustangs are 
still popular and early models are worth more than five times 
their original price. 

The first Apple III looked a lot like the Edsel. But Apple 
wasn't Ford with a long line of other models. So it pulled up its 
shirtsleeves and went to work to make the III the machine it 
was intended to be. As they worked, they gfraciously replaced 
original Ills with improved models, without charge and as 
many times as necessary for all pioneering III owners to end 
up with the computer they thought they were buying. We know 
of one individual who had eight different Ills over the first few

coordinate with it. The keyboard will be half again as wide as it 
is now. I guess the industry is stuck with the old-fashioned 
typewriter layout for the alpha characters, the QWERTY for- 
mat, as it is nicknamed. So we'll just keep the current key- 
board — letters, symbols, numbers, and all. 

To the right of the regular keyboard will be a numeric key- 
pad for inputting large amounts of data for scientific and busi- 
ness research; the Apple III has one already. Because such a 
keypad requires keys zero through 9 and a decimal point, one 
space is left over. This will contain a second return key so that 
the operator won't have to take his or her hand away from the 
numeric keypad. 

On the left of the main keyboard will be the function key- 
pad and I/O switches. Ldke the IBM Junior, my Apple IV will 
have user-defined function keys. If I'm using the keyboard as a 
calculator, for example, and repeatedly have to solve the sim- 
ple derivative 

dY/dX = f {1/X A2) = -2(1/X A3), 

I will enter this function into memory labeled as Function Key 
Number 1. If I need to solve this for Y when, let's say, X = 27, 1 
will type "X = 27," hit the function key labeled F(l), and see 
the screen print out 

F(l) of X = -1.0161053E-04 -.0001016. 

There's nothing remarkable about function keys like this. Aa I 
said, the IBM has them, and some pocket calculators do also. 
Certainly there's no reason why Apples have to be limited to 
the functions present in Basic. 

Since a three-by -three keypad has nine keys, mine will have 
eight function keys and a shift key, allowing a total of sixteen 
user- programmable functions. In addition, my Apple IV's Ba- 
sic will be able to program these function keys using software, 
so that I will be able to run a quick disk program to define all 
sixteen keys. 

Above the function keypad will be about a dozen carefully 
labeled switches, either toggle or pushbutton. These will give 
the user hardware control over his I/O ports and slots. Instead 
of having to type PR#1 or insert it in your program to turn on 
the printer, you'll be able to hit a switch, and you'll be able to 
do it after you've already started running that program in 
which you forgot the command PRINT PBil. 

The fourth keypad my Apple IV will have will contain eight 
cursor control keys. As any of you who have done any editing 
know, there is a need to control the cursor both vertically and 
horizontally. Most of the music editors such as ALF and Mu- 
sicSystem use the game paddles, but these tend to shift the cur- 
sor out of place if you brush against them accidentally. Apple 
Writer, some other word processors, and many games use the 
J,K,I, and M keys for left, right, up, and down movements of 
the cursor. It works, but, because they're in the middle of the 
keyboard, it's possible to hit the surrounding keys accidental- 
ly ; the consequences of writing a document are correcting the 
errors, but in a game you may get zapped for your inattention. 
VisiCalc has half of the ideal cursor control system, the left/- 
right arrows. Unfortunately, it's necessary first to hit a shift 
key to convert them to a vertical mode in order to move from 
row to row and another shift key to go back to the horizontal 
mode. 

We need at least four arrow keys dedicated exclusively to 
cursor control: two horizontal ones, as we have now, and two 
for vertical movements. That shouldn't be difficult. After all, 
that Heathkit terminal I built so long ago had all four — on the 
keyboard, that is; unfortunately, the existing software didn't 
recognize them. 

In addition, there are times in some games when it would 
be very useful to move diagonally. It would also save time in 
word processing. Therefore, my Apple IV will have four more 
arrow keys pointed NE, SE, SW, and NW. 

Since I've now planned a keyboard that'll be wider than the 
one on a Bosendorfer concert grand (that's the $61,000 piano 
with an extra octave at the bass end) , I'll make this cursor key- 
pad a portable one attached to the Apple IV by a tether just as 
the paddles now are. 



It'll be the size of a hand-held calculator and have eight 
large keys on the top and, of course, two buttons on the sides 
which duplicate those on the game paddles. When my boy's 
playing Apple Panic (I'll let him use this machine every Sun- 
day morning between three a.m. and six a.m.) , he'll be able to 
lean back comfortably in his chair where he can survey the 
whole screen at once, hold the cursor keypad comfortably 
wherever he wants and pound the life out of those ap- 
ples, butterflies, and death masks before they can zap him. 

This portable cursor keypad will also have a bracket so that 
it can be fastened above the numerical keypad and be made 
part of the main keyboard for use in word editing. The current 
arrows will remain where they are for backspacing and 
erasing. 

One of the most time-wasting operations with an Apple II is 
changing from game paddles to joystick and back. If your sys- 
tem is set up like mine, you have to remove the monitor from 
atop the disk drives, place the drives on top of the monitor, un- 
snap the top of the Apple's case, remove the paddles from an 
integrated circuit socket, insert all sixteen of the joystick's fra- 
gile and easily damaged pins into the socket, and put every- 
thing back together, hoping that you didn't bend a pin and also 
that you didn't reverse the disk drives so that the boot drive is 
now on the right instead of the left. 

My Apple IV will have built-in, external game-paddle and 
joystick ports, and the sockets for these wlU be on the front of 
the machine so that we won't need an extra two feet of cable 
going to the back, as will the socket for the portable cursor con- 
trol keyboard; lastly, they'll connect by sturdy plugfs that can 
be inserted and removed countless times rather than fragile IC 
pins that should be installed once and left in place. 

In fact all the most common I/O ports on my Apple IV will 
use plug-in types of external connections. Interfaces for the 
printer, disk drives, and monitor, as well as for game paddles, 
will be permanently installed just as they are on the m. Their 
plugs, of course, belong at the back of the set. 

I'm ambivalent about slots for specialized devices. Cer- 
tainly the rv must be able to use music synthesizers, graphics 
pads, time clocks, and so forth. The only question is, where to 
put them. Because empty slots waste a lot of space and re- 
quire much larger cabinets than otherwise necessary, and be- 
cause perhaps more than half the users will be content with 
disk drives, printer, and monitor with their built-in external 
ports, it might be best to use an expansion chassis for most op- 
tional peripheral cards with a sturdy, easily unpluggable ca- 
ble connection on the back of the computer itself. These could, 
perhaps, be modular units holding two boards each that could 
be fastened together to provide up to eight in all. 

So much for the external hardware. Among the cards per- 
manently installed in my Apple IV will be both Integer and Ap- 
plesoft Basic on ROM cards, with a front panel switch instead 
of one that takes a contortionist to reach, and DOS on a ROM 
card, also with a hardware switch. 

If you've ever spent half an hour or so writing a program 
that you wanted to save before you discovered that you had 
switched on the Apple without booting DOS, you'll know why I 
want this last one. I have the impression that the Apple was de- 
signed around cassette storage and that the ability to use disks 
was an afterthought. 

Not only is there no built-in, plug-type socket for the disk 
drives as there is for the cassette, but the instructions for run- 
ning disks must be loaded from an initialized disk each time 
the system is turned on. At least one competing model has its 
DOS permanently in ROM (in a plug-in module) . It's time Ap- 
ple offered this also. 

I'm also ambivalent about the number of disk drives the IV 
should have. As I said, the correct number is either zero, to 
keep the initial cost down, or two, in order to use the comput- 
er's full potential. If costs didn't have to be considered, there 
ought to be two Winchester hard disk drives for multimega- 
byte storage plus two floppies for loading canned programs 
and saving programs to be sent to other installations. 

But at current prices two hard disk drives would add some 



FEBRUARY 1982 



141 



$10,000 to the cost of the system, and that's just too much. 
Eight-inch drives hold twice as much information as the BVi- 
inch ones, but there's so much preprogrammed software avail- 
able on the 5V4-inch size that we'd need at least one of the 
smaller diameter drives anyway. 

For the moment, I guess that two 5^-inch floppies — built in- 
to the case, of course — will have to do. But the Apple Comput- 
er Inc. industrial designer who designs the IV's case should 
plan for adding a compatible dual hard drive unit, perhaps in 
place of a desk drawer. 

Also inside the case, we'll need an RF modulator and a fan. 
The external fans made by after-market manufacturers for 
the II work fine and cool my machine adequately in the 
summer, but they'd look a lot better inside the case. 
H I Can't Even Think of Her Name. What else? . . . Oh, yes 
* . . . memory . . . memory . . . MEMORY. Apple Computer 
Inc.'s marketing people missed a bet when they began talking 
about 16K and 48K Apple lis. The "48K" Apple actually is a 
64K machine ; only 48K of memory is available for the user's 
programs because Basic is in ROM and uses the other 16K. But 
if Basic weren't in ROM, it would have to be loaded each time 
the system was turned on and would still occupy about the 
same amount of memory. 

Well, the binary number system being what it is, doubling is 
the norm in the computer business. Everything seems to work 
by powers of two. Thus it must have appeared not only logical 
but inevitable that the Apple III would have 128K, double that 
of the II. But the Founding Father's micro very shortly there- 
after redoubled this memory up to 256K. And Apple Is 



vulnerable. 

Logically, then, the Apple IV would have 812K of internal 
memory. But marketing logic Isn't the logic of binary arith- 
metic. Marketing logic says — don't Just double. Don't stop at 
512K of memory. Even though it would be the giant among the 
microcomputers, this doubling Just means that a 512K Apple 
IV would be the biggest of the small. Marketing logic calls for a 
number with some pizzazz. 

And the next number with pizzazz is 1024K — Double 512K, 
four times 128K, and eight times 64K. That's shorthand, of 
course. Just as 64K (two to the sixth power) really is an ab- 
breviation for two to the sixteenth power (65,536), so 1024K 
(two to the tenth) is short for two to the twentieth power or 
1,048,576 bytes. That's right: one million, forty-eight thousand 
five hundred seventy-six bytes. 

That's a megabytel 

And that's a number with Pizzazz. 

And it's also the internal memory I want in my Apple IV. 

Will Apple Computer Inc. develop a model IV along these 
lines? I have no Idea. I hold only a few shares In the firm and 
am not privy to Its plans. But It's the kind of computer I'd like 
to buy if the price Isn't out of sight. If It's what I'd like, I sus- 
pect that it's what a lot of others would like, too. 

If Apple can come up with the right machine that will not 
merely compete with but will far outshine the Founding Fa- 
ther's micro, the price of Apple stock should go back up. . . . 
Maybe the company could even start paying dividends. That 
would be nice. There's a bunch of us loyal Apple II owners who 
bought stock at the public offering that would like that a lot.

Anything that connects to the apple computer must do so 
through an interface of some sort. In most cases, this involves 
the use of a circuit board that plugs into one of the Apple's peri- 
pheral slots. Many devices, for example, the Disk 11, Graphics 
Tablet, and the Silentype come with their own special inter- 
face boards; others may require a separate, standard interface 
board. Most printers fall into the second category. 

Any standard for communication between electronic devices 
must define two factors. The first of these is the technical 
description of the hardware interface — the quantity and nature 
of the signals used, the voltage and timing of these signals, and 
the types of connectors and pin designations to be followed. 
After the hardware interface has been defined, a procedure for 
utilizing it must be presented. This is known as a protocol. 

From the hardware side, any commimications interface 
starts as a collection of wires between the two devices that are 
being connected. Each wire can be either unidirectional 
(meaning that signals travel from only one device to the oth- 
er) or bidirectional (in which case the same wire is used to 
carry information in both directions) . An electronic sigfnal can 
be transmitted either as a voltage or as a current (technically, 
voltage and current are related, but a given interface will be 
concerned with one or the other). Voltage is usually chosen, 
and in such cases, one or more ground wires must be used as a 
reference for the other signals. 

The second factor involved in defining a standard is the 
magnitude of the voltage (or current) that will be used. Again, 
a choice must be made between uni-polar or bi-polar logic lev- 
els. A uni-polar scheme usually relies upon positive-only sig- 
nals; that is, a logic high might be represented by a signal 
greater than 2.5 volts. Any voltage between 0 and 2.5 volts 
would then be considered a logfic low. In bi-polar signalling a 
positive voltage would be used to indicate a high while a nega- 
tive voltage would be found when the signal wajs low. 

The complexity of an interface standard can usually be de- 
duced by the number of signals needed to achieve it. While a 
simple serial interface can be made with only two wires, more 
sophisticated commxuiication can require an array of signals. 
These signals fall into three categories. Data lines are those 
sigfnal wires that carry the actual information being passed. If 
data is being sent in parallel form (that is, one byte at a time) , 
there wiU be eight distinct data lines, usually labelled DATAO to 
DATA7. Serial data transmission takes place over one or two 
lines, since each byte is broken down into individual bits which 
are sent one at a time. 

Controlling the flow of data are the synchronising or hand- 
shake signals. These lines have the job of making sure data is 
transferred correctly and only at a rate both devices can han- 
dle. Depending upon the application, handshaking can be eith- 
er uni-directional or bi-directional. The remaining signals can 
be classified as control or statias lines that report on the condi- 
tion of the devices involved. While not necessary for the actual 
transfer of data, they can provide useful information about the 
communication process with which they're related. For ex- 
ample, a paper empty signal that informs the computer that its 
printer needs to have new paper installed might be useful. 

With all this in mind, let's examine some of the common 
interface standards in use today. While these standards have 
been devised to connect various types of equipment (printers, 
modenns, laboratory equipment, and ao on), we will focus on 



their use as an interface for printers. This simplifies matters 
greatly since only one-way transmission of data — from the 
computer to the printer — is involved. Even with the existing 
standards, however, connecting a printer can prove to be a 
complicated and confusing task. 

Parallel Interfaces. The most popular scheme for connect- 
ing a printer is via a parallel interface. In its simplest form, 
this consists of ten uni-directional wires. Eight wires carry the 
data from the computer to the printer. Data will usually be In 
the form of the ASCII code for the character being sent. The 
other two lines represent the handshaking necessary to coor- 
dinate the transfer. Figure 1 shows how it works. 

When the computer has a character to send. It will put out 
the appropriate code on the data lines and then send out a sig- 
nal over the strobe line. Although the polarity and timing of 
this signal are not standardized, the popular Centronics inter- 
face uses a low-going pulse of at least one microsecond. (It 
turns out that for signalling purposes, a low, or negative going, 
pulse is sometimes more desirable than a positive one. In that 
case, when the particular signal is to be transmitted, the volt- 
age on its line is brought low. Such signals are usually Identi- 
fied by writing them with a line over their names, such as 
strobe. When the printer receives this strobe signal, it looks at 
the data lines to see what character to print, and then re- 
sponds with an acknowledge signal to the computer. 

The Centronics standard printer interface also allows for 
several status signal lines, such as the following (unless other- 
wise noted, all signals are from the printer to the computer) : 

Select — On printers that have a local operation select mode, 
this line can Inform the computer of this status. 

Busy — Signifies that the printer is not ready to receive any 
more data. 

Fault — Informs the computer that there is some problem 
with the printer. 

Paper empty — The printer has rim out of paper and there- 
fore has ceased printing. 

Input prime— This Is a signal from the computer to the 
printer. On printers that support or require it, this signal is 
used to initialize the state of the printer. 

Although these status signals are not required for the trans- 
mission of data, they give the Interface some Intelligence to 
make it operate more effectively. If the printer Is turned off or 
has been de-selected, for example, it will not generate the ac- 
knowledge signal. Therefore, the first time the computer tries 
to print something, It will hang up. A better approach Is to 
check the status of one or more of the lines above to make sure 
the printer is ready before sending any data.

data involves examining each data bit at a specified time. The 
transmitting device will send each bit, one after another, down 
the signal line. The receiving device must be able to convert 
this bit stream back into the original parallel form. To do this, 
it has to know the rate at which the data is being sent, as well 
as how to distinguish one byte from another. This could easily 
be handled by having two more signal lines, a "next bit strobe" 
and a "next byte strobe," but this would defeat the purpose of 
serial transmission. Therefore, such information must be en- 
coded into the data stream. Figures 2a and 2b show how this is 
done. Note that the entire transmission is represented by one 
signal that can be in only one of two states. The signal idles in 
the low state, also referred to as a mark, which represents a 
logic one. In the high state, called a space, it signifies a logic 
zero. 

Transmission is begun by sending a start bit which is al- 
ways a space. Then the data bits are sent. There are usually 
between five and eight data bits and they are sent out starting 
with the least significant one. An optional parity bit may fol- 
low. This bit can be used at the other end to check the validity 
of the data received. Parity can be either odd or even — it re- 
fers to the total number of ones in any transmitted byte. 

With odd parity, if the data to be sent has an even number of 
one bits, then the parity bit will also be a one, making the total 
number odd. If there's already an odd number of data ones, 
then the parity bit becomes a zero, keeping the total number 
still odd. By keeping track of the number of one bits read in, the 
receiving device can detect most errors (for example, where 
one bit was read incorrectly) . Although this seems like a very 
handy feature, parity error detection is almost nonexistent in 
current peripherals. 

After the parity bit, there will be at least one stop bit, a 
mark, signifying the end of this character. The length of time 
each bit is sent depends upon the baud rate used. A baud rate 
of 1200, for instance, means that 1200 bits can be sent each sec- 
ond. Taking into account one start bit, eight data bits and one 
stop bit, each byte takes ten bit-times to send. Thus one 
hundred twenty characters per second can be sent at 1200 
baud. This system of synchronizing the transmitting and 
receiving devices by adding start/stop bits is known as asyn- 
chronous serial data transmission. 

The main standards for serial communication are current 
loop and RS-232. Current loop is the older of the two, having 
been the standard for the early teletype terminals. It works by 
connecting the two devices in a continubus loop or circuit. One 
loop is used for each direction of data transfer. The sending de- 
vice signals a space by allowing a small current (usually 20 
miliiamperes) to flow through both devices. The mark state is 
signified by no current flow. 

Much more popular today is the RS-232 standard which was 
established by the Electronic Industries Association. This stan- 
dard uses bl-polar voltage signals to communicate between 
two devices. Specifically, a mark is defined as a signal level in 
the range of -3 to -25 volts. A space is represented by -1-3 to

new articlt's, rcx it'us and in aliiations. Judt4inii fnun tlu' rt'spijnst' 
ac'c'ordt'd llit' first t-dition, w liich inimt'diatel> sold out. there i.s u 
j^reat need for a ^uide to the hundreds of proijrams that compete 
for the Apple owner s dollars. \\ ith the introduction of the 
card, ehoices yet e\en harder concerning what to purchase; 
therefore, we dedicate this book to you, the consumer. W'e hope 
you w ill use it for a miide and as a reference to awist you in mak- 
ing intelligent and informed decisions u hen purchasing soflw are. 

('urrentK. the Ap[ile C;oni|)nter owner is presented \\ith a 
hew iklering selection of software front which to choose. On the 
one liand. this should i)lcase yttu in that, as the ow ner of probably 
the most popular uiiero-eornputer in the w(»rld, you have a w ide 
and ra)iidl\ growing selection of software from which to clioose. 
On [he other hand, this wide and grow ing select i<»n present.s sonic 
problems. The \ ast mafttrity of retail computer store staff people 
simply just do not have the time lo adequately review each new 
piece of software that comes in their store. The problem is corn* 
pounded if the new program is an extensive of complicated one, 
such as an accounting package or a word proces.sing svstem. or a 
coniprehcnsi\e data base management program. This dtH'S not 
mean that store personnel do not want to give yo\! the best scr\ ice 
possible: it's just thai it is an alniosl imjiossible task. If you pur- 
chase software through the mail, the risks that you assume, 
without a reliable guide to assist yon should be ap{)arent. 

Other pitfalls aw ail the uninfornu.'d buyer, For instance, in too 
many cases you cannot by the appearance of the package w hether 
the program rccpiires Integer Basic or Applesoft Basic or whether 
il needs 16. 32 or 4Sk of RAM. Il is also often difficult to tell 
when \ i)u purchase a program on tape whether it can be trans- 
ferred to disk or. if a disk program is purchase<l. whether il can 
be copied or not. 

Another area that can present problems to the buyer is the 
sicnilarits of software. A wcIl-stfK'ked con^puter store may 
possibU offer five different word processing packages, four 
assemblers, ten different adventure type games and/or .several 
mail list programs, (the choiees seem endless): all of which have 
ob\ ious adv antages and disadv antages as well as different prices. 

The goal of "The Book" is to eliniiniite as n^an> of these poten- 
tial problem areas for the software buyer as possible. 

\\ e w elcome anv conmients or eritii isms from readers that v\ ill 
help ns in reaching this goal.

+25 volts. Figure 3 outlines the signals used and their pin num- 
bers on the standard's DB-25 type connector. 

RS-232 was designed to connect data terminal equipment 
(DTE) to data communications equipment (DCE) . Basically, 
these terms refer to computers and modems, respectively, for 
which the standard is very well defined. When other devices 
are connected using this standard, however, things can get a 
little confusing. 

Consider, for example, the transmit data and receive data 
lines. It should be obvious that this nomenclature can only re- 
fer to one of the devices — ^the transmitted data on TD line is ac- 
tually the input signal for the other device's receiver. There- 
fore, when connecting two computers, or a terminal and com- 
puter, it is sometimes necessary to cross connect these two sig- 
nals. As for the rest of the handshake lines shown in figure 3, 
they only have meaning when connected to communication de- 
vices such as modems. Some interfaces will allow these lines 
to be left unconnected, but others require that the full protocol 
be satisfied. This is usually accomplished by connecting jump- 
er wires between one or more pairs of pins on one connector. 

Then there is the matter of where to hook the printer's busy 
signal. Even when the proper connections have been made, 
there's no guarantee that the timing of the busy signal will be 
correct to prevent loss of data. This is because there is no 
specification of such criteria in the RS-232 standard. 

Even such harmless things as the unassigned connector 
pins can cause a great deal of trouble. Case in point. There was 
a guy who wanted to put a longer cable between his computer 
and printer. With this in mind, he purchased a high quality, al- 
beit used, cable from a surplus dealer. Assuming that the ca- 
ble was nothing more than twenty-five wires running straight 
between the two connectors, he replaced the original cable in 
his system with the longer one. You can imagine his words when 
he powered up his printer and smoke began to pour forth from 
it. Further investigation of the replacement cable revealed 
that there was a jumper wire installed within one of the con- 
nectors (this discovery required physically taking the connec- 
tor apart) . Apparently, this jumper had been necessary to the 
fvmction of the former equipment. These particular pins, how- 
ever, being undefined by the RS-232 standard, were also used 
by the printer and, unfortunately, were connected directly to 
two of its power supply voltages. Thus, as soon as the cable 
was attached, it presented a short circuit to the printer. 

The moral of this true story is that standards should not be 
relied upon too heavily. Do not assume that two devices can be 
connected immediately just because they both claim to be 
"RS-232 compatible." 

Serial Protocols. Three forms of serial protocol have been 
used to control the transmission of data from one device to an-

other. The main object of a protocol is to ensure that no data is 
sent to a receiving device while the receiving device is not pre- 
pared for it. The simplest way to do this is via one or more ad- 
ditional signal wires which reflect the readiness of each device 
to receive or transmit. Some of these signals are shown in fig- 
ure 3. 

RS-232 was developed mainly for communication through 
modems, however, and there's no way to pass any of these ex- 
tra signals over the modem link path. Therefore, all hand- 
shaking between the two devices must be carried out over the 
existing full-duplex channel. This is accomplished by using 
special codes to signify when to start and stop sending. 

One such technique is known as the x-on/x-off protocol. 
When the receiving device is ready to accept data, it sends out 
the x-on code (the same as the ASCII DCl, or hex 11) to the 
transmitting device. If the receiving unit becomes unable to 
accept more data, it sends out the x-off co^e (ASCII DCS or hex 
13) which causes the transmitting device to stop sending data 
until it receives an x-on signal again. 

Another form of handshake is the etx/ack method. This 
technique assumes that the receiving device has an input 
buffer and that the sending device knows the size of this buffer. 
Under these conditions, the sender will transmit a block of text 
followed by the end of text code, etx (hex 03) . As the receiving 
device is processing the data from the output of the buffer 
(printing it, for instance), it looks for the etx code. When it finds 
this code, it sends b^ck the acknowledge code, ack (hex 06). 
This signals the other device to send another block of text. 

The x-on/x-off and etx/ack protocols work well for trans- 
mission through modems. When connecting a printer through 
a serial interface, however, these techniques are awkward and 
slow, and require duplex operation (two-way data communi- 
cation) . Since a printer is usually going to be connected directly 
to the computer (no modem or telephone link involved), the 
logical answer is to use a hard-wired signal to indicate a ready 
or busy state. This is exactly what is done, but unfortunately it 



FEBRUARY 1982 



is not clear which line of the RS-232 standard to use. The two 
most likely candidates are the DTR and CTS lines, but neither 
is clearly the more popular. Therefore, when connecting print- 
ers via RS-232, some pin swapping or re-cabling may also have 
to be done to put the appropriate signals on the correct pins. 

Other Interfaces. Aside from simple parallel and serial 
interfaces, there are many other bus structures for transfer- 
ring data. Probably the next most common is the IEEE 488 
general purpose interface btis. This standard, pioneered by 
Hewlett-Packard, was designed primarily for connecting pro- 
grammable test instruments to each other to build automated- 
measurement systems. This standard, along with its 
implementation on the Apple II, will be discussed in greater 
detail in a future column. 

The latest trend in interface structures lies in the concept of 
a network. A single high frequency signal cable is routed be- 
tween one or more computers and their peripherals. All data to 
be transferred between any of the devices is transported over 
this single wire. 

Even though there is only one wire, several distinct trans- 
missions can be carried out simultaneously. Each device on 
the network must be given a unique code so that it can know 
which data on the line is meant for itself. One beauty of this ap- 
proach is that a new peripheral can be added to the system by 
simply tapping into the network cable. 

Graphics Routines. Many of the new printers have graphics 
capabilities similar to the Apple's hi-res graphics displays. 
Several programs have appeared that make it possible to 
dump an entire hi-res screen to the printer with one simple 
command. 

Since any good peripheral board for the Apple will contain 
some firmware routines, a few printer interface board manu- 
facturers are including graphics dump routines right on the 
board. This is very convenient because then it only takes a few 
keystrokes to dump a picture, instead of requiring that you 
load a separate routine from disk. One of the first boards to

have this feature was the Grappler from Orange Micro. Be- 
sides handling simple dumps from either hl-res screen, this 
board can rotate an image ninety or one-hundred eighty de- 
grees, make it full size or double size, and/or produce a nega- 
tive image (see figure 4) . All of this is done with very simple 
control commands that can be issued from the keyboard. The 
particular command letters chosen for the Grappler have al- 
ready become somewhat of a standard with which other manu- 
facturers are striving to be compatible. 

Buffers. Since the printer will handle data at a much slower 
rate than the computer, it usually is responsible for tying up 
the computer while it is printing. One way to avoid this is to use 
a printer that has a buffer that can accept data at the com- 
puter's speed and then spit it out at the slower printer speed. 

Unfortunately, most printers don't have a very large 
buffer, if they have one at all. Therefore, they don't offer much 
relief for long printouts such as a program listing. Another so- 



lution to this problem is the software print spooler which can 
print a file while the computer continues to work on something 
else. Unfortunately, the unmodified Apple is not very well suit- 
ed to handle such a task. 

A better approach is to put some sort of fifo (first in, first 
out) buffer between the computer and the printer. If the buffer 
is large enough to hold the entire text to be printed, then the 
computer can dump all of the text into the buffer at high speed. 
Then, while the printer takes its time to finish printing, the 
computer is free to do other things. With the capacity of 
memory chips increasing and their price dropping, this fea- 
ture is sure to become standard on many printer interface 
boards. At least two such boards are already on the market; 
they'll be reviewed in detail next month.

O f T A L K When the Time Is Right! 



In our January 1981 issue, with regret, we announced changes in our distribution policy. Effective imnDediately Softalk will no longer be provided free to all 
owners of Apple computers for an indefinite period of time. Instead, all Apple owners will be given a one-year complimentary subscription, after which they 
will be given the option of dropping the magazine or converting their complimentary subscription to a paid one. 

Living with that policy change has been somewhat difficult. Because the fact is that we at Softalk have genuinely enjoyed giving each of you the best 
magazine we could produce each month free of charge. 

Some things have changed, but we remain dedicated to bringing you the best magazine possible each month. 

In the coming months you'll find in Softalk: an interview with Richard Bach, a series on word processors, a beginners article on the Apple III, a column on 
computer graphics. Exec Stoneware, Exec Sirius, and a column on education. There will also be our continuing columns: Assembly Lines, The Pascal Path, Be- 
ginners' Corner, Mind Your Business, Softcard Symposium, Hardtalk, Basic Solution, Third Basic, all about Applesoft, and Ventures with VisiCalc. Rounding 
out our coverage of the Apple world we have AAarketalk News and Reviews, Tradetalk, Newspeak, and our monthly bestseller poll. 

We are confident you'll be getting your money's worth. 

One immediate change you'll notice is the protective wrapping beginning this issue which should spare Softalk the ravages of the U.S. Postal Service. This 
wrapping could not be afforded when Softalk was shipping for free. 

But generally, what you'll be getting for your money is exactly what you previously got for free — Softalk magazine as you see it now. 
Implementation of the paid subscription policy is as follows: 



1. No subscriptions ore considered to hove started before the October 1980 issue. September was mailed courtesy of Apple Computer Inc. and will not be counted 
against the one-year free subscription. 

2. Dating from the first month in which our records show that a subscriber has received continuous service, twelve issues will be mailed on o complimentary basis. 

3. Subsequent to the twelfth complimentary Issue, a notice of renewal will be mailed, advising of the changeover to paid subscription. All subscribers who do not choose 
to renew will be promptly removed from the active circulation rolls. Under no circumstances will any Apple owner ever be billed for issues not ordered. The notice of 
renewal is not an invoice, but a reminder of a change in status. 

4. Beginning with the February issue, the cover price of Softalk will be $2.50, or $30 per year. The one-year subscription rate will be $24, with the following exceptions: 

a. Apple owners who receive Softalk compliments of their local retail store or a software publisher will be granted the courtesy rate of $18 per year. Softalk will 
regularly publish a list of those retail outlets and software publishers who hove joined this program for the Information of subscribers. 

b. Apple owners who desire multiple subscriptions may deduct $6 per subscription for each subscription after the first. 

c. Public libraries, nonprofit Institutions, and schools of all kinds, public and private, elementary, secondary, and higher education, receive the special rote of $8 per 
year for the first subscription and $5 per year for each additional subscription. 

5. Softalk will not recognize as a break In continuous service the failure of the U.S. Postal Service to deliver any issue that Softolk's circulation list shows was mailed. 
Subscribers should inquire about replacement copies of non-delivered Issues approximately on the 15th of the month of issue. 

6. No break in service, for whatever reason, subsequent to the receipt of twelve free Issues will entitle on Apple owner to additional complimentary issues. 

7. Softalk welcomes written inquiries as to the applicability of the subscription rates to any individual. Such inquiries must state clearly what question is being raised and 
postulate the answer from the subscriber's viewpoint. 

8. Any paid subscriber may terminate his subscription at any time for any reason and request a full refund of the unused portion of the subscription rate. 

9. Under no circumstances should anyone presently receiving Softalk remit money until such time as they receive their notice for renewal.

FEBRUARY 1982 




BEGINNERS 

Co 



If you're among the majority of Apple users, you do most of 
your communicating with the computer by way of its built-in 
keyboard and a video monitor or television set. That is, you 
talk to the Apple with your fingers and it replies with various 
kinds of messages and displays on screen. 

That's a marvelous, simple, and convenient way of doing 
business, but it's by no means the only possible way. Looking 
ahead, the computer user of the fairly near future will proba- 
bly have the option of addressing the computer with his or her 
own voice and getting responses from it in the form of synthe- 
sized speech. Voice-entry terminals that will let you teach your 
Apple to recognize and respond to the unique sound of your 
own voice are already available for the Apple. And speech-syn- 
thesis technology is coming along apace. 

Looking off in the other direction, it was not too long ago 
that computer programmers expressed themselves to their 
machines through the awkward medium of punched cards and 
received feedback on slow and clumsy teletype terminals. 

What You See Is What You're Gonna Get. Because the 
video screen is so predominantly the center of attention when 
you're working or playing at the computer, we're going to 
devote this month's column to a discvission of the Apple's 
various video display modes. In the process, we'll round out 
our survey of memory usage in the Apple, because, as you'll 
see, when you gaze at your television set or monitor, you're ac- 
tually looking in, as through a window, at a certain region of 
the computer's memory. 

The Apple has several different display modes, all of which 
are controlled by a process known as memory mapping. The 
so-called default state of the machine— the one in effect when 
your first turn the computer on or when you hit reset — is text 
mode. As the name suggests, that's the mode appropriate for 
displaying ordinary text characters on the screen. When 
you're typing in a program, cataloguing a disk, or doing any- 
thing else that doesn't require graphics, you'll be using the Ap- 
ple in text mode. 

A Shaggy Dog Program. To see what memory mapping is 
all about and how it applies to the Apple's text display, type in 
and run the following otherwise worthless little progfram: 

10 HOME 

20 FOR t = 1024 TO 2047 
30 POKE l,128*RND(l) + 128 
40 NEXT I 

50 FOR I = 2047 TO 1024 STEP -1 
60 POKE 1,160 
70 NEXT I 

If all has gone well, here's what should happen. The first line of 
the program clears the screen. The next three lines, 20 through 
40, put a random value between 128 and 265 into every mem- 
ory location in turn from address 1024 to address 2047. The 
computer's random number generator picks a number be- 
tween 128 and 255 and pokes it into address 1024 ; then it picks 
another number and pokes it into address 1026, and so on until 
it reaches address 2047. 

Each time a number gets stored in one of those memory lo- 
cations, a character gets printed on the screen. That's be- 
cause this particular area of the Apple's random access mem- 



ory is reserved for the function of controlling the text screen. In 
fact, each address within this range controls a specific loca- 
tion on the screen. 

Well, that's almost true. The Apple will display a total of 
twenty-four lines of text, and each line can have as many as 
forty characters. Forty multiplied by twenty-four equals 960, 
and the memory range in question holds 1,024 addresses, so 
there are sixty-four that are left over and have nothing to do 
with the text screen. 

As Key Given, ASCII Returned. The computer looks at the 
value stored at each of the text screen memory addresses and 
translates it into a specific alphanumeric character according 
to a code called ASCII (see Beginners Comer, October 1981) . 
Actually, for the purpose of text display, the Apple has its own 
idios3Ticratic way of handling the ASCII code. Only 128 dis- 
tinct values are reqviired to represent all the various upper- 
case and lower-case alphabetic characters, the numbers, and 
punctuation symbols. Since each memory address on the Ap- 
ple is an eight-bit byte that can be made to hold any value from 
0 to 255, there's actually room for a bigger code than normal 
ASCII. 

If you've got a disk handy, save this little program (we'll 
come back to it), type new, and enter the following ditty: 

10 HOME 

20 FOR A = 0 TO 255 
30 POKE 1024 + A, A 
40 NEXT A 

When you run this one, you'll see how the Apple translates 
ASCII for display purposes. The values from 0 to 63 produce in- 
verse characters — black characters on a white background (or 
a green background, if you have a green phosphor monitor) . 
The next sixty-four values in the ASCII code translate to flash- 
ing characters, and, finally, the last 128 values — from 128 to 
255— produce normal display. 

By now you can't have failed to notice something peculiar 
about the way the text screen is mapped. You might expect 
that poking values into consecutive memory locations from 
1024 to 2047 would fill the screen row by row, from top to bot- 
tom. It doesn't work that way. For reasons that are best known 
to experts in television electronics, the memory map splits the 
screen into three segfments. The first forty addresses cover the 
top row of the screen; the next forty get the top row of the sec- 
ond segment, the following forty the top row of the third seg- 
ment; and so on. That arrangement makes life a little more dif- 
ficult for programmers, but then it wouldn't do for them to get 
too complacent, anjrway. 

When You Go Home, You Space Out. Let's return now to 
our original program. The last three lines (50 to 70) clear the 
screen, by poking the value 160 into each of the relevant ad- 
dresses, starting at the bottom of the text screen and working 
upward. The value 160 represents a space in ASCII; it's the 
character you print when you hit the spacebar. It's also the 
value that the system stores in all those memory locations 
when you type home or hit escape-shift-P. 

Notice how much faster the last three lines of our program 
are executed than the first three are. It takes time for the Ap- 
ple to pick a random number, and that slows down the screen- 
filling section of the program. 

Notice too that when you clear the screen by typing home or

hitting escape-shift-P, the order is carried out inatantaneous- 
ly, even though the computer has to do essentially the same 
thing that the last three lines of our progn^am accomplish — it 
has to put the value 160 into each of those memory locations. 
The difference is that home and escape-shift-P call up machine 
language routines in the Monitor, so the computer can carry 
out the order without consulting the Basic interpreter. Basic is 
quick, but machine language speeds can be pretty awesome by 
comparison. 

Now we're going to add a couple of lines to the program. If 
the program isn't in memory right now, load it back in from 
disk. Type the following: 

15 X = PEEK (-16302) 

16 X = PEEK (-16298) 

17 X = PEEK (-16304) 

Those peeks will be explained presently but, for the mo- 
ment, just type run and notice what happens. If you've got a 
color monitor, your screen first will fill with gray stripes. One 
by one, the stripes will be covered over by a random quilt in 
sixteen lo-res colors. Finally, the screen will revert — from bot- 
tom up — to gray stripes. 

A Picture's Worth a Thousand Characters. Here's what's 
going on. The second and third peeks that you added to the pro- 
gram (in lines 16 and 17) have put you into another of the Ap- 
ple's display modes— lo-res graphics. The rest of the program 
does exactly the same things it did before, only now our 
memory area — still 1024 to 2047— is used to map out a lo-res 
screen instead of text. Those 960 addresses that govern the lo- 
cation of characters on the screen can put pictures there in- 
stead, providing that a couple of soft switches in memory are 
thrown. 

A soft switch, you may recall from last month's discussion 
of the Apple speaker, is a location in memory that affects some 
input/output function of the computer. It's called a soft switch 
because you control it with software — with program com- 
mands. All you have to do to throw a soft switch is ask the com- 
puter either to read the value stored at the switch's address or 
to put some value there. Just peek it or poke it.

There are four soft switches that govern the Apple's video 
display. We'll get to a summary of them before this article is 
done, but for now you can note that lines 16 and 17 in our pro- 
gram set switches to produce lo-res graphics ; line 15 sets a dif- 
ferent switch to ensure that the entire screen will be in lo-res 
graphics mode. Try changing line 15 to read 

15 X = PEEK (-16301) 

and run the program. You'll see that you also have the option 
of mixing text and graphics. This is handy for programmers 
who want to put pictures on the screen but still be able to com- 
municate verbally with the user. 

Playing with Blocks. The text mode used 960 memory loca- 
tions to govern an area forty-by-twenty-four — forty characters 
(sometimes called columns) per line, twenty-four lines. In lo- 
res graphics you get to control twice as many spots on the 
screen — 40 columns by 48 rows. Each memory location now is 
responsible for two lo-res blocks, one directly above the other. 

For elucidation of this process we need to return once more 
to binary and hex. Each memory location holds an eight-bit 
binary number. To plot in lo-res, the computer treats the byte 
as two separate, unrelated, four- bit quantities (these are called 
nibbles) . So, for example, after our program has finished run- 
ning, the address 2039 holds the value 160. In binary that num- 
ber looks like this : 10100000. The Apple checks the first four bits 
and sees 1010. From that it knows to plot a gray block in the 
lower right comer of the screen. Then it looks at the other nib- 
ble and sees four zeros. That value tells it to plot a black block 
directly above the gray one. 

Many people find it easier to talk about these matters xising 
hex notation. To paraphrase the previous paragraph, using 
hex: the decimal value 160 stored at location 2039, in the com- 
puter's way of thinking, looks like AO. The nibble A means plot 
a gray block, and the nibble 0 means plot black. The second, or 
so-called low-order, nibble gets plotted directly above the first, 
or high-order, nibble. 

Since there are sixteen possible values for either nibble, the 
Apple is capable of plotting sixteen colors in its lo-res graphics 
mode. 

Top-Hat-and-Whlte-Tie Graphics. So what's next? Hi-res 
graphics, naturally. Change line 16 in our overworked little 
program to read: 

16 X = PEEK (-16297) 

and now run it. Surprised? What you're looking at now is a hl-res 
graphic display of some sort, but oxir program is not doing any- 
thing to affect it. In fact, what you see on your screen now de- 
pends on what you were doing with your computer before you 
started reading this column. If you had the machine off, you 
may now be looking at some regfular pattern of light and dark 
areas on your screen. 

The reason why our program isn't having any effect on the 
screen is that our program is still poking values into the region 
of memory from 1024 to 2047, and hi-res graphics are con- 
trolled from somewhere else. 

Type in the following new version of line 20 : 

20 FOR I = 8192 TO 16383 

Now, when you hit run, you'll get some action. But it's pretty 
boring, it takes a long time to finish, and the random patterns 
of dots on the screen that this program generates aren't very il- 
luminating. So, unless you're especially long on patience at this 
moment, you might want to type control-C, to stop the pro- 
gram, and then text to get back to where you can manipulate 
the program some more. You won't be able to see the word 
text as you type it, but as soon as you hit return, the video win- 
dow into the computer's memory will shift from the hi-res area 
back to the zone we were working with before— addresses 1024 
to 2047— and your words will suddenly reappear. 

You'll get a better handle on how hl-res graphics are plot- 
ted if you poke specific values, rather than random ones, into 
the appropriate memory locations. First we'll clear the screen 
to black. Type new and create the following program: 

10 X = PEEK (-16304) 

20 X = PEEK (-16302) 

30 X = PEEK (-16300) 

40 X = PEEK (-16297) 



Lazer isn't afraid to compare! 

(because we have the best lower case system available.) 

Despite the fact that we were one of the first manufacturers to produce lower case equipment for the Apple II, Lazer 
Microsystems products are still the state-of-the-art. Beside the obvious price/performance advantage we have over the 
competition, our products are expandable. Lazer is constantly introducting new products including our Lower Case + Plus 
II, Character Set + Plus (that adds 2 additional character sets to the Lower Case + Plus), and our new "Double Vision

60 POKE A,0

80 FOR B = 1 TO 1000

100 TEXT 

This program isn't real swift either, but it takes less time to 
finish than the other one, because it doesn't require the com- 
putation of random numbers. The first four lines of this pro- 
gram set the soft switches to give us a full screen of hi-res 
graphics. The next three lines put the value of zero into every 
memory location concerned with this hi-res screen. The last 
three lines provide a short pause, so you can see what you've 
done, and then return you to the text mode. If you want that 
pause to be longer, put a larger number than 1000 in line 80. 

Author Goes Dotty, Makes for Bar. FYom this experiment 
we observe the following: poking zero into every address con- 
trolling the hi-res screen turns everj^hing to black; the hi-res 
screen, like the lo-res/text screen, is mapped in three seg- 
ments; and there's a great deal more territory to cover in hi- 
res than there is in lo-res/text. 

If you now modify line 60 to read 

60 POKE A,1 

and run the program, you'll see rows of dots form on the 
screen, with the dots spaced about a pica from each other hor- 
izontally. Gradually the dots will coalesce to form forty ver- 
tical bars. 

When you get back to text mode, change the value poked in 
line 60 to 2 and run the program once more. Now you'll see 
straight lines turn temporarily to wavy lines as the bars shift 
piece by piece to the right. 

Run the program a third time, with the value poked in line 
60 changed to 3, and you'll see the lines fatten up. It looks as if 
poking 3 into each location combines the effects at poking 1 and 
poking 2. And that's exactly what occurs. 

The hi-res screen is plotted in bits rather than nibbles. To be 
precise, the computer plots according to the status of the seven 
low-order bits in each byte. The eighth bit has to do with the 



TIME IS MONEY 



determination of color, and the subject of color in hi-res is 
somewhat too complex for discussion here. 

When we first ran our program, poking 0 into each location, 
the computer saw the value 00000000 stored in each hi-res loca- 
tion and turned everything to darkness. After we poked 1 in 
everywhere, each byte held 00000001, so the computer plotted 
one dot for each byte. When each byte held the binary value 
00000010, the computer turned off the dots it had previously lit, 
and illuminated the adjacent ones. Poking 3 at every location 
jdelded the binary number 00000011, so the bars grew to be two 
dots in width. You can see, perhaps, that if you were to change 
the value poked to 127, you'd create a binary number full of Is 
at every memory address and the screen would turn to solid 
color. Try it. 

You Take the Hi-Res and I'll Take the Lo-Res. In the Ap- 
ple's hi-res mode, you can plot 53,760 points. Each of the forty 
positions available in lo-res is now subdivided into seven loca- 
tions (one each for seven low-order bits) , yielding a total of 280 
points horizontally. And each of the twenty-four lines avail- 
able in text mode is now subdivided into eight separately plot- 
table points, making for a total of 196 positions vertically. 

That large chunk of memory that maps the hi-res screen, 
from 8192 to 16383, is often called the hi-res page. This is unfor- 
tunate, since the word page is also used to describe another 
unit of memory— the 256-byte frames mentioned in last 
month's column. The hi-res page is also sometimes called a hi- 
res buffer or a picture buffer. 

The Apple actually has two such areas of memory, usually 
called the primary and secondary hi-res pages or hi-res page 
one and hi-res page two. The second region, following directly 
upon tlje first, extends from 16384 to 24575. Having two hi-res 
areas allows programmers to store more than one image in 
memory at a time and to flip quickly from one display to an- 
other for animation effects. 

There is also a secondary display area for the text and lo- 
res modes, extending from 2048 to 3071. This is also the area, 
however, where Applesoft program instructions normally 
reside, so you can't ordinarily use this secondary display 
region from an Applesoft program. 

Throwing the Switch on Graphics. Now that we've covered 
all this territory, we can summarize the soft switches that af- 
fect the video (Usplay. There are four of them, and each can be 
in either of two positions. The first governs whether the Apple 
will be displaying graphics (either res) or text. Peeking -18303 
puts the Apple into text mode. Peeking -16304 throws the 
switch the other direction and sets a graphic mode; which 
graphic mode depends on the condition of the second soft 
switch, at locations -16297 and -16298. Peeking the former 
puts the Apple in hi-res; the latter puts it in lo-res. If the Apple 
is in text mode, then the condition of this second switch is ir- 
relevant. 

If the Apple is in either graphics mode, then a third switch 
determines whether the entire screen will be devoted to 
graphics, or whether the screen will be in a mixed mode, with 
the bottom four lines remaining in text display. Peeking -16301 
sets a mixed display, while peeking -16302 turns the whole 
screen over to graphics — assuming the graphics switch is set. 

The fourth switch, at address -16300 and -16299, sets either 
the primary page or the secondary page. The first of these 
locations puts you in primary page, the second in secondary. 

The soft switches are not the only way to get from graphics 
to text and back. There are commands in Applesoft that ac- 
complish the same thing. Actually they do a little more. Typing 
GR, for example, will put you in lo-res graphics, primary page, 
with mixed graphics and text display. It also clears any 
msLterial that may have been lurking on the lo-res screen. 

Similarly, HGR puts you in hi-res page one, with mixed dis- 
play, and clears the screen. HGR2 puts you in the secondary hi- 
res page, without the four lines of text at the bottom of the 
screen, and clears everything to black. 

The moral of all this is that the soft switches are useful to 
programmers because they provide more flexible ways of get- 
ting in and out of various display modes.

The Making of the 
Magnetic Media 

for Micros 

BY DALE AI^CUIDALD 

We take them for granted, those little square packages that 
contain so many hours of work and thought. We expect them to 
function, and, usually, they do. 

But how? What are they really? How are they made? How 
did they acquire their strange powers? In short, qua floppy? 

Many are the brand names that emblazon our floppies — 
Verbatim, Dysan, Inmac, Memorex, Maxell, Scotch, and 
more— each with its loyal following. Because it shares a home 
base with this author, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, 
makers of Scotch disks (and a few other plald-emblazoned 
products you might have a passing acquaintance with) , was 
the cojnpany whose disk manufacturing procedure willingly 
suffered our investigation. It can be assumed that the others 
bring their floppies forth by substantially similar means. 

From Humble Clay to 48K. Kent Didriksen, marketing de- 
velopment supervisor for data recording products for the 
memory technologies group at 3M, and Len Meissner, techni- 
cal services specialist for the same outfit, were our guides on a 
tour of the disk manufacturing process. Here, then, is a narra- 
tive account of the arduous journey of the delicate yet plucky 
little brown disk, from the Initial bonding of its goassamer ge- 
netic material with life-giving primordial magnetic goo ; then 
to be poked at, pimched out, racked up, dried out, and cut up 
for a seeming eternity until its restless wanderings bring it fi- 
nally to the soft, protective fold of a PVC fabric liner, when it fi- 
nally settles down and goes to work. 

Every 3M disk, whether 5J^-inch or 8-Inch, starts from a 
polyester substrate some .003 inches thick manufactured by 
3M in "Jumbo" rolls. 

At the firm's Camarillo, California, plant, an iron oxide 
magnetic dispersion material is brewed. These particles and 
binder system form a magnetic paint that's coated onto the 
polyester under strict constraints. It is applied to a thickness of 
100 micro-inches, or .0001 inches. 

Meissner pointed out that "the requirements for diskette 
media also have to have a random orientation of these mag- 
netic particles." In effect, if the particles were all to point the 
same direction, there would be modulation of the signal: it 
would alternate coming in strong and weak as the disk spvin. So 
the coating must be done in a web form. A random orientation 
procedure makes the particles face in all directions, as if mag- 
nets around the media were switched on and off in random 
patterns. 

After the roll is coated. It goes through various drying pro- 
cedures. The jumbo stock roll is slit down to smaller rolls, and 
these are transferred to 3M's Weatherford, Oklahoma, plant. 

At the Oklahoma converting, packaging, and testing facili- 
ty, the rolls are punched to the two sizes. 

"The punching is very critical to maintain the dimensional 
tolerances required for the media," Meissner says. "The cen- 
ter hole for the diskette has a tolerance of plus-or-mlnus .001 
inches for proper registration in the equipment." 

After punching, the product goes through a burnishing or 
polishing operation to provide good contact with the head for 



uniform signal level. The burnishing also smooths the surface 
of defects or rough spots that would cause a dropout. 

The Weatherford plant manufactures the jackets that pro- 
tect the disk surface. These are polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with 
a fabric liner laminated to the Inside. This is then folded into a 
jacket. The liner gflves vinlform torque and rotational charac- 
teristics to the disk, cleaning the surface at the same time. 

Time of Trial. Next, the plant begins to test the disk. "There 
are various stages of testing all through the process for the 
various parameters," Meissner explains; "although it's a very 
simple construction, there are quite a few specifications in the 
process that relate to the electrical and mechanical perfor- 
mance of that product." 

The frequent tests during the manufacturing process mea- 
sure such aspects as specific signal amplitude level, resolution, 
modulation, overwrite (when data is rewritten time and again; 
this would be a measure of the remaining signal from a previ- 
ous record), torque tests, surface smoothness, dimensional 
parameters, and many more. 

Some of the 8-inch disks are formatted with prewritten In- 
formation that Identifies tracks and sectors. This Is a courtesy 
for equipment that either can't format disks or uses them in 
such high volume that the time factor in formatting them 
would be a problem. 

The 514-inch mini disk is not formatted. "Most of the mini 
equipment goes through a formatting procedure," Meissner 
said. On the Apple II and II Plus, for Instance, a new disk is 
routinely Initialized. All disks that go out nonformatted are 
bulk degaussed. 

Some disks have reinforced centers applied during produc- 
tion. Meissner is wary of kits on the market offering ways to 
strengthen the center hole. He questions whether the .001 tol- 
erance of the center hole can be maintained faithfully by a 
handheld unit. Obtaining the reinforced center from a manu- 
facturer, therefore, he believes Is a good investment. It 
improves the clamping characteristics Inside the drive.

Floppy disks have a second, smaller hole. This is an index 
hole that defines the beginning of the track. In effect, it's a me- 
chanical marking point used by almost all 8-inch disk drives 
and by most 5V4-inch drives; Apple and Atari are notable ex- 
ceptions. 

When the disk is placed into the drive, it begins to spin: 300 
rpm for mini disks, 360 rpm for 8-inch. The read/write head re- 
ceives pulses signalling it how many steps the head should 
move in. A stepper motor — the whirring sound you hear when 
a disk is booted — moves the head in the correct number of 
steps. 

Turn On, Boot Up, Drop Out. For those of you interested in 
buying a disk drive, consider this: the width of a track is .012 
inch. The section of the read/write head that takes informa- 
tion from it is .0001 inch wide. Didriksen explained that this gul- 
ly has current passing through it from one side to the other to 



read the bits of information — ones and zeros — on the track. 
Some of the less expensive stepper motors used in some inex- 
pensive disk drives may not put the head at the correct spot. 
The result: information dropping out. 

Another problem that can cause information to be dropped 
is the presence of dust, iron oxide, or polyester on the disk. 
Even cigarette smoke, with all the other things it does, can 
cause a head to bounce and data to be missed, just as you'd 
miss words if you were to move the telephone receiver away 
from your ear during a conversation. Hitting a hair would be 
like a speedboat hitting a floating tree. 

Notching a disk to use both sides can be a mistake. Meiss- 
ner points out that the disk you buy has been closely tested to 
select the good side ; the other side may be very bad. Notching 
the disk could damage the media or introduce particles Inside 
the Jacket. 



Why you need The Inspector. 



If you're serious about programming, you need 
to set all your utilities together in one place — 
inside your Apple. The Inspector comes on an 
Eprom that simply plugs into the D8 socket, or on 
a disk ready to merge with hiteger Basic for 
automatic loading on boot. Either way, it stays at 
your fingertips, ready to call without disturbing 
your current program. 

The Inspector puts you in total control of both 
memory and disks. You can search forward 
and backwards, edit, read nibbles, 
map disk space, dump the screen 
to a printer, examine every secret 
of your Apple. Use The Inspector 
to repair blown disks, undelete 
files, input "illegal" commands, 




read and alter files, locate strings in memory or on 
disk. The uses are endless. The manual, alone, is an 
education. And it's always when you need it. 

You need the most powerM disk and memory 
utility available for your Apple. You need the 
Inspector.

ARTSCI explains why some 
word processing systems 
are better than others. 



Let's begin with an easy to understand explanation of what a word 
processor is and how ARTSCI has created a professional system. 



A word processing system is simply 
an easier, faster and less expensive way 
to type. With a modern word 
processor, documents are entered on a 
video screen instead of paper. 

You can enter your first rough draft 
without concern about errors or 
spelling. Simply go back and insert 
letters, delete words and even move 
paragraphs with a few keystrokes. No 
document will ever have to be retyped. 

WORD PROCESSING 
AND THE APPLE II 

The APPLE II is the most 
expandable, inexpensive micro- 
computer available today. It can 
perform almost any task, including 
word processing. 

The standard APPLE II however, 
uses a 40 column video display. This 
display causes a serious word 
processing problem: How do you 
display a full sized 80 column letter? 
Most word processing programs 
available today do not solve this 
problem. 




THE MAGIC WINDOW 

ARTSCI has developed the Magic 
Window word processing system 
that incorporates the full power of a 
professional word processor and solves 
the APPLE'S display problem without 
expensive hardware. 

The first feature of a professional 
word processing system is the ability to 
enter and edit data in a fast and 
friendly manner. The Magic 
Window operates just like a 
standard typewriter. The electronic 
paper moves to the left across the 
video screen as you type. Almost any 
size document can be represented on 
the video screen. You can see the edges 



of the paper through this Magic 
Window as you type 

The rule is: What 
you see on the screen 
is what you'll get in 
print. However, 
if you print using 
proportional spacing, 
the result will look even 
better than the screen. 

This typewriter simulation, together 
with simple to use menu selection of 
functions and electronic editing 
abilities, creates the finest word 
processor available on the standard 
APPLE II. 

MAGIC WORDS 

The second feature of an advanced 
word processor is the ability to find 
and correct mistakes. The most 
common mistake in most documents 
is the misspelled word. 

ARTSCI's Magic Words program 
will take any document you can create

FEBRUARY 1982 



Yet another disadvantage, according to Meissner, is that 
nmning the disk in the opposite direction will almost certainly 
cause the fabric liner to unload its store of dust, smoke parti- 
cles, and other debris onto the read/write head of your drive. 

This is a good argument for using a head cleaning kit: it 
clears the gully of the dust and g^k it collects. Didriksen de- 
scribes 3M's head cleaner as consisting of two disklike pads of 
a nonwoven material inside a jacket with no liner. Included 
with these is a bottle of an alcohol/fluorocarbon cleaner. To 
use it, you simply dampen a nonwoven pad with the cleaner 
and run it in the disk drive for about thirty seconds. The pad 
scrubs and dries the read/write head as it spins. 

Each pad is meant to be used fifteen times, then discarded. 
For double-headed drives, removing a label allows both heads 
to be cleaned at once. 

Didriksen suggests that the frequency with which you use 
the head cleaner depends on how you use yoior machine. For 
some users, every second day might be necessary; others 
might need to clean the heads less than once a month. It's sim- 
ply a preventive step. 

Sometimes a drive's aUgnment can go out, causing the 
media to be suspect. If you're constantly having trouble with 
a disk, ask a friend or two to try to run your programs. 

What about demagnetizing the heads? In pre-floppy days, 
tape recorder heads needed demagnetizing so that high-fre- 
quency tones wouldn't drop out. Meissner explains that the 
read/write heads on disk drives are of a ceramic design that 
doesn't magnetize. That's what Yankee ingenuity is all about. 

The majority of disks are of very good quality. The Ameri- 
can National Standards Institute (ANSI) specifications are the 
industry standard. 

"That defines the physical and electrical parameters of the 



media and what's needed in the drive for an interchange cri- 
teria. There can be, at times, areas that might not relate to 
that specification that can cause specific problems such as 
flimsiness or noise created as the diskette spins," Meissner 
said. In some cases, flimsy Jackets make the media seem light- 
weight, but these shouldn't affect the operation of the disk. 

At 3M, tight control means ensuring that the jackets, disk, 
and magnetic material are consistent. 

The disk lifetime industry standard, according to Meiss- 
ner, is 3.5 million passes per track, minimum. On a minidisk 
this would add up to ten twenty-four-hour days per track. In- 
ternal specifications at 3M are even tighter. 

Care and Feeding. The operating and storage environment 
of a disk should range between 50 degrees and 125 degn^ees Fah- 
renheit. Higher temperatures can cause the PVC to warp. 
Relative humidity should be kept between 8 percent and 80 per- 
cent. 

Finally, If you're planning to reuse disks, it isn't necessary 
to nm them through any type of degaussing to rid them of mag- 
netic fields. Just reuse them. They have experienced much, 
and shall endure. 

Is there a difference between disks? Probably the greatest 
differences are in the subjective feelings of users. Some disks 
just feel better. It is a fact, however, that only about a half 
dozen manufacturers control every process, from mixing their 
own PVC to blending their magnetic paint. Others buy the ma- 
terials to manufacture disks in their name, but don't make the 
basic parts. Though all disks must meet the aforementioned 
ANSI standards, there is of course a potentially wide range in 
quality once those standards have been met. "The buyer must 
perforce beware that though all disks are theoretically cre- 
ated equal, some are more equal than others.

Is your Apple lonely? Does it long for the company of other Apples, who are overworked and sick of balancing checkbooks? 

A night out on the town at the local computer club just won't hock it. If you confronted your computer it would probably ask for a week's vocation or at 
least a little fresh air. Now you can surprise your Apple and give it a much needed respite from the usual doily chores and provide it with some fresh air and 
spectacular scenery at the same time. 

On June 5, 1 982, a luxurious cruise ship will depart from Vancouver, Canada, furnished with all the necessary ingredients to moke your Apple forget its 
doldrums and crawl out of its rut. For seven days your Apple will be kept busy learning such august skills as assembly language from Roger Wagner, 
graphics from Ken Williams, and the compiling of Applesoft programs into assembly code from Dennis Goodrow. 

Besides coming bock more intelligent, your Apple will be treated to the usual shipboard conveniences by a professional staff dedicated to providing 
everything a microprocessor might desire. The Apple will enjoy some of the most dramatic scenery north of Silicon Gulch, stopping in Ketchikan, Juneau, 
and Skogwoy, some of the last frontier communities. If will cruise past extinct volcanoes and Glacier Boy — a true hi-res graphics bonanza. 

Amazingly, in keeping with Softolk's usual standards, the Apples will be taking the tour free. Apples unwilling to port with their owners for even a week 
may inquire about the cost of human participation by writing to:

Goodrow are committed to giving seminars on this cruise unless extraordinary business contingencies arise.

Tools of the Craft, Part 8 

Procedures and Parameters. You've 
met both kinds of workers, I'm sure. 
There's the sociable one, who is always 
checking with superiors and co-workers 
to find out exactly what needs doing and 
report success or failure (or deliver re- 
sults). Then, there's the "loner," who 
wants only to be told "do your thing," 
then goes off to work in isolation, until the 
job is done. Apple Pascal permits you to 
write procedures that behave in either 
fashion. 

So far, I've only shown you examples 
of "loner" procedures. As I mentioned 
last month, the way to call such a proce- 
dure is simply to use its name as a state- 
ment in your program. For example, 
here's a program that includes, and calls, 
a procedure named Beep. 

PROGRAM 
TestBeep; 

PROCEDURE 
Beep; 

(* Causes the Apple to emit an audible tone. *) 
BEGIN (* Beep *) 

Write(Chr(7)); 
END (* Beep *); 

BEGIN (* TestBeep *) 

WriteLn ('I feel a beep coming on.'); 
Beep; 
END (* TestBeep *). 

You may be curious about the Chr(7) 
that appears in Beep's only statement. 
Remember the ASCII character set? I 
mentioned once that each printable char- 
acter corresponds to a unique integer 
value from the range 0 to 127. Capital A, 
for instance, corresponds to the integer 
65, capital B to 66, and so on. There are 
certain "invisible characters" in the 
ASCII set. One of these corresponds to 
the integer 7. If you Write it to the screen, 
you won't see it, but you will hear it. 
"Chr(7)" stands for this "bell" or "beep" 
character. (Also, as you may already 
have guessed, Chr(65) corresponds to 
capital A and Chr(66) stands for capital 
B. "Chr" is an example of a Pascal func- 
tion. I'll talk at length about it, and func- 
tions in general, next time.) 

Try compihng and executing Test- 
Beep. (If it doesn't beep at you, your Ap- 
ple may be broken.) Beep is a good ex- 
ample of a "loner" procedure. It is self 
contained: it doesn't take anything from, 
or make assumptions about, the main 
program. It doesn't use global objects. It 
can be transplanted to another program 
without any difficulty whatsoever (as 
you'll soon see) . Beep simply does its job 
when called, then retires until called 



again, leaving behind no trace, no clue 
concerning the success or failure of its 
mission. The "loner" procedure has no 
way to communicate with its caller. It 
just forges ahead with its fixed task, ob- 
livious of all else, in much the same way 
that a telephone answering machine 
without message-taking ability will spew 
forth its recorded greeting to comple- 
tion, even when the telephone connection 
is prematurely broken by a disgruntled 
human on the other end of the line. Like 
such a mechanism, a "loner" procedure 
is handy, up to a point, but that point is of- 
ten reached very quickly. 

The majority of useful procedures re- 
semble the "sociable" worker more 
closely than they do the "loner." Instead 
of going off and doing something inde- 
pendent of supervisor or co-workers, 
most procedures cooperate with not only 
their caling programs, but also with 
other procedures, in sharing the work- 
load so as to accomplish a large task. 

Most often, a calling program will 
pass information to a procedure; actual 
data that the procedure needs in order to 
perform a certain calculation. For in- 
stance, two integer numbers might be 
passed to a procedure designed to com- 
pute and display the sum of their 
squares. 

Calling programs may also pass en- 
coded commands to certain versatile 
procedures. Suppose you write a proce- 
dure that can display the name of any 
one of the days of the week. The informa- 
tion passed to such a procedure might 
consist of a digit, between 1 and 7, inclu- 
sive, corresponding to the current day of 
the week. In this case, the information 
passed to the procedure by the caller 
forms the basis of decision, not computa- 
tion, and so I'd classify it as a command. 

Occasionally, a procedure will pass 
information back to its caller, or will ac- 
cept some information, transform it ac- 
cording to some predetermined plan or 
formula, then hand it back to the caller. 
A commonly encountered procedure of 
this type accepts a character, and, if that 
character is a lower-case letter, returns 
the upper-case version to the caller; 
otherwise, the original character is re- 
turned. 

Parameters: The Chamiels of Com- 
munication. A "sociable" procedure 
communicates with its caller through pa- 
rameters, which are very similar to the 
"in-baskets" and "out-baskets" that 
human beings use for inter-office commu- 
nication. You tell the compiler that a pro- 
cedure requires parameters by includ- 



ing a parenthetical parameter list in the 
procedure definition, between the proce- 
dure's name and the semicolon that ends 
the procedure heading. (For specific de- 
tails, see Figure 1: the sjoitax diagram 
for a parameter list. Figxire 2 is the syn- 
tax diagram for a procedure, reprinted 
from last month's discussion.) There are 
two types of parameters, regular or 
"value" parameters, and so-called 
"VAR" or "reference" parameters. 
Regular parameters correspond to "in- 
baskets." By their very nature, they can 
transmit information from the caller to 
the procedure, but not in the opposite di- 
rection. A VAR parameter may be ei- 
ther an "in-basket," an "out-basket," or 
both. Pascal puts certain tricky restric- 
tions on the use of VAR parameters, and 
it is more difficult to use them properly. 
Consequently, I will examine them last, 
after having primed you with a discus- 
sion of regular parameters. 

You define any parameter (regular or 
VAR) much as you'd define a variable. 
An identifier, used as the parameter's

name in the body of the procedure, is as- 
sociated with a data type. However, only 
the names of previously declared data 
types may be used in a parameter list. 
Look at the following two procedure 
headings (which, for brevity's sake, are 
presented here without the bodies that 
must accompany them in a real pro- 
gram) : 

PROCEDURE 

ShowDay l(DayNumber 

:DayNumRange); 
PROCEDURE 

ShowDay2(DayNumber 

:1 .. 7); 

Assuming that the data type Day- 
NumRange has been declared in the sur- 
rounding program's TYPE section, the 
Pascal compiler will accept the first pro- 




u-) i: T A I 1^ 



cedure heading as valid, but reject the 
second. In the second heading, the regu- 
lar parameter DayNumber is defined 
with an explicit subrange of Integer. This 
kind of type specification is permissible 
in the VAR section of a program or pro- 
cedure's declaration area, but not in a pa- 
rameter list. The compiler will reject 
such a parameter definition, complain- 
ing of Error 2 ("Identifier expected"), 
when it encounters the explicit sub- 
range. (In other, similar situations, the 
compiler may report Error 103 — "Identi- 
fier is not of the appropriate class.") 

The Pascal compiler requires that 
you associate a data type with a parame- 
ter for much the same reason that you 
must associate a data type with a vari- 
able ; doing so makes you think about the 



FEBRUARY 1982 



nature of the parameter, and permits the 
compiler to warn you if, later, you try to 
use that parameter in a way that is con- 
trary to its stated purpose. 

Here's a procedure that requires two 
regular Integer parameters, NumA and 
NumB. 
PROCEDURE 

SumSqrsl(NumA, 

NumB 

:lnteger); 

(* Compute, and display on the screen, 
the sum of the square of NumA and NumB 
in a display field at least 6 columns wide. *) 

BEGIN (* SumSqrsl *) 

WriteLn( ((NumA * NumA) + (NumB * NumB)):6 ); 

END (* SumSqrsl *); 

SumSqrsl demonstrates the fact that, 
as in variable declarations, you can 
group several parameter identifiers to- 
gether in a sublist, each separated from 
the next by a comma. All the items in 
such a sublist will be parameters of the 
same data type. Examine the following 
procedure and try to imagine its be- 
havior: 

PROCEDURE 
Report(BadValue 
:Boolean; 
ItemNumber, 
ItemValue 
:lnteger); 

BEGIN (* Report *) 

WriteCltem #, ltemNumber:4,': ', 

ltemValue:7); 

IF BadValue 

THEN 

WriteC *♦* BAD VALUE'),- 
WriteLn; 
END (* Report *); 

Report sends a message to the screen 
concerning the validity or invalidity of 
ItemValue. No matter vfh&t BadValue is, 
both ItemNumber and ItemValue are 
displayed on the screen , presumably for 
the benefit of some hypothetical user. If 
BadValue is True, however, the dis- 
played message is extended in order to 
indicate that ItemValue is somehow in- 
appropriate. ItemNumber and Item- 
Value are "data" parameters — in other 
words, they are information that the pro- 
cedure either displays (as here) or uses 
in computation. BadValue, on the other 
hand, is a "command" parameter; its 
sole purpose is to alter Report's be- 
havior. 

Report demonstrates another aspect 
of the parameter list (which can also be 
gleaned from the syntax diagram, of 
course) : the definitions of parameters 
that have different types must be sepa- 
rated from one another by semicolons. 

How to Call Procedures. Now that you 
know how to define regular parameters, 
let's look at the process of using them to 
pass information to procedures during a 
call. In the procedure definition, you 
specify and name a set of "in-baskets," 
in other words, the formal parameters. 
In the procedure call, you provide a par- 
enthetical list of data values, called the 
actual parameters. Regfular formal pa- 
rameters are nothing but local variables 
that are declared in a special place. 
When the procedure is called, Pascal aa-

signs the values of the actual parame- 
ters to the corresponding formal param- 
eters. The value of the first actual pa- 
rameter is assigned to the first formal 
parameter, the second actual value goes 
into the second formal parameter, and so 
on down the line. The number of actual 
parameters given in a procedure call 
must be the same as the number of for- 
mal parameters declared in the proce- 
dure's definition. The compiler will note 
a syntax error (Error 126 — "Number of 
parameters does not agree with declara- 
tion"), if your program attempts to pass 
too many or two few parameters to a pro- 
cedure. Also, the type of an actual pa- 
rameter must agree with the type of the 
corresponding formal parameter. Pas- 
cal will not permit you to call a procedure 
if, for instance, that procedure re- 
quires a Boolean value as its first pa- 
rameter, and you supply an Integer in- 



stead. In this instance, the compiler will 
report Error 142 ("Illegal parameter so- 
lution"). 

With the procedure body, a regular 
formal parameter behaves exactly like a 
local variable. The only difference is, a 
local variable must be initialized by an 
explicit statement in the procedure body, 
while a regular formal parameter is ini- 
tialized automatically at the time of the 
call. There is, however, nothing else that 
is special about regular parameters. If 
you wish, you can assign new values to 
such parameters during the execution of 
the procedure body, just as you can 
change the contents of local variables. 
Doing so has no effect on anything that is 
outside the universe of the procedure. 

To help you better understand the re- 
lationship between actual and formal pa- 
rameters, here's a procedure definition 
along with several examples of legal and

wish, you may use entire expressions as 
actual parameters. 

VAR Parameters: Not Magic, but 
"Voodoo." I tend to use long, descriptive 
variable names in my programs, and, as 
much as they contribute to program 
readability, sometimes they can be cum- 
bersome. For example, suppose I have 
an Integer variable named Explosion- 
Count. To increment this variable by one, 
I must normally use the following state- 
ment: 

ExplosionCount := ExplosionCount -I- 1; 

In having to type such a long variable 
name twice, I run the risk of making a 
typographical error in one or the other 
(or both). It's also rather boring to type 
so much. What I often do, to alleviate this 
problem, is define a procedure named 
Inc (for Increment), which takes an 
Integer variable and increments the con- 
tents by one. Using Inc, this is all I need 
write, in order to add one to Explo- 
sionCount: 

Inc(ExplosionCount); 

The above is more succinct than the as- 
signment that I presented earlier. You 
don't want to go to all the trouble of de- 
fining a special procedure, of course, un- 
less you face the prospect of having to in- 
crement long-named variables often, 
throughout your program. 

Suppose, however, that you need, and 
want to write, the Inc procedure for your 
own use. Regular parameters are insuf- 
ficient for the task. What this procedure 
requires is some way to grab hold of, and 
manipulate, an arbitrary external ob- 
ject. This is exactly the capability that is 
provided by the VAR mechanism. 

I have often seen computer program- 
mers described as "witch doctors" or 
"wizards," because programs frequent- 
ly resemble collections of weird, unintel- 
ligible incantations, at least in the minds 
of those who haven't taken the time to 
seek out the method in the madness. It

strikes me as ironic that we Pascal pro- 
grammers, despite our mania for writ- 
ing readable programs, may Just have to 
plead gtillty to the charge of witchcraft, 
because VAR parameters are nothing 
more than computer-age voodoo dolls. 
The voodoo doll and the VAR parameter 
were created to serve the same basic 
function: someone needed to affect an ob- 
ject that, for one reason or another, could 
not or should not be approached directly. 
The Ju-ju man (or woman — voodoo Is an 
equal opportimlty sorcery) solved the 
problem by creating a little doll, which 
voodoo magic linked to some person or 
animal. From that point on, anything 
that happened to the doll would also hap- 
pen to the real victim. Secure and se- 
cluded In a tiny backwater hut, the voo- 
doo practitioner could Inflict all kinds of 
suffering on the hapless victim by re- 
mote control. 

When a procedure that uses VAR pa- 
rameters Is called, Pascal links the for- 
mal VAR parameter with the corre- 
sponding actual parameter. During exe- 
cution of the procedure, the formal VAR 
parameter Is merely a synonym for the 
variable that Is the actual parameter. 
Anything that happens to the formal pa- 
rameter within the procedure body also 
happens to the actual parameter In the 
world outside the procedure. Thus, a pro- 
cedure can affect variables that belong to 
the calling program, even while remain- 
ing quite separate from It. 

As figure 1 shows, VAR parameters 
are defined in the same formal parame- 
ter list as regular parameters. They are 
defined using the same rules as regular 
parameters, except that the definition of 
a VAR parameter is prefaced with the 
keyword VAR. Here are the headings for 
several procedures that use VAR pa- 
rameters : 

PROCEDURE 

Vexampll(RParm 

:lnteger; 
VAR 

VParm 

tinteger); 

PROCEDURE 

Vexampl2(RParml 

ilnteger; 
VAR 

VParml, 

VParm2 

: Integer; 

RParm2 

: Integer); 

PROCEDURE 

VExampl3(RParm1 

!lnteger; 
VAR 

VParml 

:Boolean; 
VAR 

VParm2 

:Real; 

RParm2 

:Char; 
VAR 

VParm3 . 

:CHar); 



In these examples, any parameter 
whose name begins with "RParm" is 
a regular parameter, while any whose 
name begins with "VParm" is a VAR pa- 
rameter. Of course, the Pascal compiler 
finds nothing significant in my choice of 
names. I could have prefixed all the reg- 
ular parameter names with "VParm," 
and all the VAR parameter names vrlth 
"RParm." It is only my use of the key- 
word VAR which enables the compiler to 
distinguish VAR parameters from regu- 
lar ones. 

In calling a procedure which uses 
VAR parameters, you must be careful 
that the corresponding actual parame- 
ters are variables, not constants or ex- 



pressions. Since a procedure is allowed to 
assign a value to a formal VAR parame- 
ter, Pascal insures, at the time of the 
call, that the actual parameter is an ob- 
ject into which a value can be stored (in 
other words, a variable) . If it is not, Pas- 
cal reports that Error 15U ("Actual pa- 
rameter must be a variable") has oc- 
curred. 

Consider the following: 

Definition: 



PROCEDURE 
Capitalize(VAR 
Ch 

:Char); 




172 



^ O E T A I 1/ 



FEBRUARY 1982 



Call: 

Capitalize(CommandCode); 

The Job of Capitalize, as you may al- 
ready have guessed, is to convert the con- 
tents of Ch from a lower-case letter to an 
upper-case one. (Therefore, if Ch doesn't 
contain a lower-case letter, Capitalise 
leaves it alone.) The body of Capitalize 
will be presented and examined next 
time; although interesting, it is Irrele- 
vant to this discussion. 

Suppose that Capitalise is called, as in 
the example above, with CommandChar 
as its actual parameter. For the dura- 
tion of the call, the formal parameter Ch 
becomes a voodoo doll representing Com- 
mandChar. If the procedure examines 
the value of Ch, it actually looks at the 
value contained in CommandChar. If the 
procedure body modifies Ch, Command- 
Char is likewise modified. 

Given knowledge of how to define and 
use VAR parameters, it is very simple 
for us to write the Inc procedure : 

PROGRAM 
Testinc; 

VAR 

Number 
; Integer; 

PROCEDURE 
lnc(VAR 
Destinotion 
rinteger); 

(♦ Increments destination by one. *) 
BEGIN (* Inc ♦) 



Destination := Destination + 1; 
END (* Inc *); 

BEGIN (* TestInc *) 
Number := 100; 

WriteLn('Number before Inc: ', Number:7); 
Inc(Number); 

WriteLN('Number after Inc: ', Number:?); 
END (* Testinc ♦). 

To contrast the VAR parameter 
mechanism with that of regular parame- 
ters, you might try compiling and exe- 
cuting another version of Testinc, in 
which the keyword VAR is absent from 
Inc'a formal parameter list. How does 
this second version of Inc behave? Can 
you predict the behavior before execut- 
ing the program? Another informative 
experiment involves leaving the key- 
word VAR in Inc'a parameter list, but 
calling Inc in the body of the test pro- 
gram with an integer expression, in- 
stead of an integer variable, as the pa- 
rameter. Does the program compile? If 
so, what happens when you execute it? If 
not, what error message (s) do you re- 
ceive? 

Write and WrlteLn: Anomalous Pro- 
cedures. By now, you have probably real- 
ized that Write and WrlteLn look very 
much like procedures with parameters. 
In fact, both of them are classified as 
"standard" procediu-es, and the paren- 
thetical lists of items that you supply to 
each are, indeed, lists of actual parame- 
ters. 

Unfortunately, Write and WrlteLn do 



not behave entirely as do the Pascal pro- 
cedures that you are able to define. For 
one thing, we've seen that a regular pro- 
cedure must require a fixed number of 
formal parameters, if it requires any pa- 
rameters at all. You cannot get away 
with supplying only two parameters to a 
procedure that requires three. When call- 
ing regular procedures, you must supply 
exactly as many actual parameters £U9 
there are formal parameters in the pro- 
cedure definition. What's more, the ac- 
tual parameters supplied must be listed 
in the correct order, so that the type of 
each actual parameter agrees with that 
of the corresponding formal parameter. 

In contrast. Write and WrlteLn may 
accept an arbitrary number of parame- 
ters. In the case of WriteLn, you need not 
supply any parameters at all ! There is no 
prescribed order to parameters for these 
procedures, because any parameter to 
Write or WriteLn may be of Char, Inte- 
ger, Real, or String type. Finally, the pro- 
vision that Write and WriteLn make for 
display field width specifications is be- 
yond the scope of regular procediu'es. 
Write and WrlteLn, then, are "magic" 
procedures. While they resemble the 
regular Pascal procedures, they are ac- 
tually quite different in nature. 

Toward a Software Toolkit. One of the 
nicest things about procedures is that, if 
you design them carefully, you can physi- 
cally transplant them from program to 
program with little or no difficulty, thus 
saving yovirself the work of having to re-

PUT CHSTE OVER 



Introducing Station II. 

The Apple II Support System. 






What happens when you put one over on Apple II? You 
make it better. Because Station II organizes, simplifies, 
protects, secures and lets you control access to your 
Apple. In other words, it makes your Apple II y our 
personal computer. 

IT'S DESIGNED FOR n-GETHERNESS. / 

Station II is designed specifically for Apple II by 
design consultants to Apple Com- 
puter. It pulls your Apple and peri- 
pherals together into an attractive, easy- 
to-use, integrated system. 

Your Apple is free to slide in and out, so 
there's no unstacking and restacking peri- 
pherals everytime you need to get inside, 
And you can choose the distance from 
keyboard to monitor that's most com- 
fortable for you. Station II even posi- 
tions your monitor at just the right 
angle for maximum viewing 
ease. 

rr CLEARS YOUR DESK OF 
CORDS AND CABLES. 

^ Station II is equipped 

with three built-in power 
outlets, so the cords and 
cables that normally clutter 
your work area are tucked away neatly 
inside. Now one cord. Station II's own, 
powers your entire system. 

Apple and Apple II are registered trademarks of Apple Computer. 






THE KEY IS SECURITY 

AND CONVENIENCE. 

You're not the only one who's 
discovered the value of 
Apple II, so Station II has a key. 
And a lock. And two ways to 
secure it. Now you can slide your 
Apple inside, lock it and leave it. 
Safe and sound. It puts the clamps on 
theft, and beyond that, you control 
who gets inside your Apple and who 
doesn't. 

Your programs are safe, too. Because 
Station II has a line voltage surge sup- 

Eressor, ready to intercept power surges 
efore they can wipe Out your program. 
What's more, the key means conven- 
j ience. With one twist 
of the wrist you can 
power up your entire 
system. Plus, you can lock 
your Apple "on" or "off." 
IT MAKES YOUR APPLE 
MORE FRUITFUL. 
That's what happens when you put 
one over on Apple II. So look for 
Station II at your computer dealer.

invent them for every new program. I 
mentioned earlier that Beep was such a 
procedure, and we are about to use it 
again, in yet another example program. 
Procedures that exhibit Beep's portabil- 
ity, and which perform common tasks or 
solve common problems, are examples 
of "software tools." One of the goals of 
this series is to help you develop a toolkit 
of your own, containing an assortment of 
procedures and other objects with which 
you can more easily build interesting, 
complex programs that address your 
own particular problems and interests. 

If you wish, you may consider and use 
Beep as your first software tool. The fol- 
lowing example defines another tool, the 
procediore Pav^e: 

PROGRAM 
TestPause; 

PROCEDURE 
Beep; 

(* Causes the Apple to emit an audible tone. *) 
BEGIN {* Beep *) 

Write(Chr(7)); 
END (* Beep *); . 

PROCEDURE 
Pause(Duration 

:lnteger);(* Generate a "do-nothing" pause. 
Pause(l) = 0.1 second (approx.). 
Tested on a standard Apple ][ with 
Apple Pascal 1.1. 

*) 

CONST 

TickLength= 159; 



VAR 
Tick, 
TickLet 
:lnteger; 

BEGIN (* Pause *) 

FOR Tick := 1 TO Duration DO 

FOR TickLet := 1 TO TickLength DO 

(* Nothing this is just a time waster *); 

END (* Pause *); 

BEGIN (* TestPause ♦) 
Beep; 

Pause{100); (* Ten seconds *); 
Beep; 

END (* TestPause *). 

Pause's only purpose is to keep the 
computer busy until a certain amount of 
time has passed. You may think that 
such a procedure is worthless, but there 
will be many times when you write pro- 
grams which, for example, process and 
display information so quickly that a hu- 
man being can't follow it all. In such sit- 
uations, you can call Pause, to force the 
computer to wait for a specified length of 
time, in order to give the human a chance 
to catch up. 

Pause's accuracy is controlled by the 
constant TickLength, and the speed with 
which the Apple Pascal P-Machine exe- 
cutes instructions. If you use Pau^e on a 
different computer (such as the Apple 
III, which executes Pascal more quickly 
than the Apple II) , or if a new version of 
Apple Pascal is released. Pause will not 
keep proper time, and you will need to 
adjust TickLength until Pause Is accu- 
rate again. This readjustment process Is 



very tedious: You must recompile the 
test program, then execute it and ob- 
serve the actual time Pause takes for 
some large value of Duration (for exam- 
ple 1200, which should correspond to two 
minutes) . If Pau^e runs too fast or slow, 
you must adjust TickLength up or down 
by some arbitrary amount that you feel is 
appropriate, and repeat the whole se- 
quence. 

Besides its touchiness, there is some- 
thing else which is noteworthy about 
Pause, and I mention it here to conclude 
the "lecture" part of this month's excur- 
sion along the Pascal Path. Although it is 
a "sociable" procedure, in that it allows 
the caller to specify the duration of the 
pause that it generates, Pav^e keeps se- 
cret the exact details of how it does its 
job. The variables Tick and Ticklet, and 
the constant TickLength, are all local to 
Pav^e, at once invisible and inaccessible 
to any caller. 

As Pau^e modestly demonstrates, the 
integrity, security, and privacy of a pro- 
cedure body need not be compromised 
for the sake of communication and coop- 
eration with the calling program. By 
carefully defining and using a combina- 
tion of local objects, regular parame- 
ters, and VAR parameters, you can usu- 
ally achieve both desirable conditions, to 
the detriment of neither. 

An Exercise. Earlier, in the section 
"Parameters: The Channels of Commu- 
nication," I introduced a procedure 
ShowDayl, whose body I never defined. 
Assuming that the TYPE DayNum- 
Range has been defined (in the calling 
program's declaration section) as the in- 
teger subrange 1..7, write your version of 
the complete ShowDayl. My version Is 
printed below.

Exploring Business Basic, Part 6 



Last episode covered a mixed bag of 
topics and ended with a promise to cover 
some parts of the new request invokable 
module and techniques on using prini iis- 
ing. Fear not, all that and more is cov- 
ered herein, including some tips on long 
integer decimal arithmetic. But first, a 
few digressions based on comments 
some of you made on previous articles. 

Digression Number One. One of the 
first articles asserted that random rec- 
ord files were limited to 32,767 records, 
the maximum positive integer value. In 
fact, there is no particular limit in SOS on 
which this Basic limit is based. Basic 
even allows a real number to be used as a 
record number, but because Basic uses 
an integer type internally to keep track of 
the record number, the value still cannot 
exceed 32,767. The actual position in the 
file is determined by multiplying this rec- 
ord number by the record size assigned 
when the file was originally created (de- 
fault is 512 bytes). This 32,767 limit on 
record numbers does not hold for Pas- 
cal. Now that the Profile hard disk is 
available, some thought is being given to 
removing this restriction. Speak up if it's 
been a problem for you. 

Digression Number Two. As 
demonstrated last time, the geW state- 
ment in Basic can be used to read the ex- 
act contents of most files on the Apple III, 
one byte at a time. We even created a 
special formatted dump program to in- 
vestigate the contents of Basic data files. 



Some types of disk files cannot be opened 
by Basic, however. Most notably, these 
include Pascal code and data files. If you 
need to examine the contents of those 
files from Basic, you can do so by using 
the Pascal Filer to change the file type to 
ASCII, which Basic knows as the text file. 
You Pascal programmers will enjoy Ba- 
sic once you try it! 

There is another file type which is 
very interesting to examine, and Basic 
will allow you to open it directly. Those 
are the Catalog or Subdirectory files, 
which you create from Basic or the Utili- 
ties program. The subdirectory capabil- 
ity of SOS is one of its most powerful fea- 
tures. If you aren't using subdirectories 
to group your files and programs logical- 
ly, you might want to read the relevant 
sections of the Basic manual and the Ap- 
ple III Owner's Guide. One problem with 
files in Basic, however, is that it is dlffl 
cult to discover from a running program 
whether or not a given file or program al- 
ready exists. There are some ways using 
on err to work up a solution to this prob- 
lem, but nothing very tidy. However, be- 
ing able to open and read a directory or 
subdirectory allows us to check on ev- 
erything before opening a file or chain- 
ing to another program. 

Those of you who read last month's 
article know about our handy-dandy file 
dump program using get#. Let's pick a 
typical subdirectory named mysub con- 
taining the files myprogram and direc-

torydump. Using the formatted dump 
program from last time, the file contents 
look something like figure 1. 

For those of you who did not read last 
month's column, this may look bizarre, 
but it's really easy. Remember that this 
is a b5i;e-by-byte image of the file. The 
numbers to the left (like 0000-OOlF) are 
the byte numbers in hexadecimal of that 
particular row. Each row contains thir- 
ty-two bytes. The top row in each pair is 
the actual hex contents of the file, and the 
next row is the ASCII equivalent charac- 
ters. If the byte is a nonprinting charac- 
ter, it is represented by a period. This is 
all fine, but you will immediately protest 
that other than being able to spot the sub- 
directory name and the file names, the 
printout is a big mystery. Business Basic 
to the rescue! It turns out that Basic is 
knowledgeable of the contents of direc- 
tory files, so that when you open a direc- 
tory or subdirectory file, Basic will auto- 
matically format the contents for you, 
just as it does in the catalog command. 
The following simple program will illus- 
trate, on the same subdirectory we just 
looked at: 

1 INPUT"Directory to dump: ";a$ 

10 OPEN#l,a$ 

15 ON E0F#1 GOTO 60 

20 INPUTi4(l;a$ 

30 PRINT LEN(a$)":"a$ 

50 GOTO 20 

60 CLOSE 

70 END 

The only thing unusual here is that we ar- 
ranged to print the length of each string 
that is read, to check for any special for- 
matting. The output looks like figure 2. 

Since all the columns are in very pre- 
dictable places, it is possible to extract 
the information desired easily by judi- 
cious use of the mid$ function. Also, since 
this is a subdirectory, there is no line 
showing blocks free and blocks in use. 
Try losing this program on a volume di-

HOW MUCH ARE YOU WORTH? 



An interesting question and, in these financially turbulent 
tinnes, an important one. Surprisingly, most people do not, ex- 
cept in a general sense, know the answer. 

Although most would agree that it is necessary and impor- 
tant to plan for their financial future, few have taken the time 
to take the first step. Taking that first step requires determin- 
ing, with some degree of accuracy, exactly what is one's cur- 
rent financial situation. This is accomplished by further deter- 
mining how much income is coming in and how it is being 
spent. "THE HOME ACCOUNTANT'' is designed to 
facilitate that very important first step.

ble to get a full list of all the files on a vol- 
ume by successively reading the individ- 
ual subdirectory files. Another treat for 
the esoteric members of the audience is 
to compare the information in the hex 
dump with the formatted output to dis- 
cover where and how SOS hides all the in- 
formation about files. 

New Stuff. As promised last time, 
we'll now go briefly into one of the most 
powerful new capabilities of Business Ba- 
sic, the request invokable module. Nor- 
mally, all access to SOS files is done 
through the input, print, read, write, and 
get statements of Basic. Basic interprets 
your desires and performs operations 
called SOS calls to do the actual work of 
reading and writing to physical devices. 
There are times, however, when the pro- 
grammer needs direct access to the in- 
formation which SOS has about files, and 
other times when certain status and con- 
trol information needs to be interrogated 
or set. More information about what this 
information consists of for a particular 



driver can be found in the appropriate 
reference manual for that driver. 

Of greatest interest to us now, how- 
ever, is the ability to use SOS directly to 
read and write data to files. A single SOS 
fwrite command can transfer up to 64K 
bytes of data to a file. Normally Basic al- 
lows writing only one variable at a time, 
and although it is possible to put more 
than one value in a single print or input 
statement, there are real limits on the 
amount of data which can be transferred 
at one time. This generally means that 
arrays of data get written vsing for-next 
loops — adequate, but hardly a speed- 
burner. 

To help solve this problem in situa- 
tions where performance is at a pre- 
mium, the request module contains two 
procedures: filread and filwrite. They 
are documented in the request, doc file on 
the Basic disk, but for reference, here are 
the formats: 

PERFORM FILREAD(%filnum,@array$,%num- 

bytes,(ai,count) 



PERFORM FILWRITE(%filnum,@array$,%nom- 
bytes) 

Filnum refers to the file number you 
used in the open statement for the file to 
be read or written. It can be any file 
which Basic is allowed to open. This in- 
cludes device files like .console as well as 
disk-based text and data files. The perr 
cent symbol in front of the filnum indi- 
cates that you should either use an inte- 
ger variable, or put the % in front of any 
constant you use, to insure that an inte- 
ger value is passed to the procedure. Ar- 
rays refers to a string variable which 
contains the name of the array which you 
wish to read or write. The @ character on 
the front of the string variable name in- 
structs Basic to pass the memory ad- 
dress of the string, not the actual con- 
tents of the string itself. The invokable 
module is responsible for finding out 
what array name is in the string, and 
then locating the array in memory. The 
numbytes parameter tells the procedure 
how many bytes are to be read or writ- 
ten from the array. In the filread proce- 
dure, the extra parameter count allows 
the procedure to pass back information 
about how many bytes were actually 
read, in case an eof or other event pre- 
vented the reading of the full amount of 
data specified. It must be an integer vari- 
able.

FEBRUARY 1982 



One note is important here. These pro- 
cedures read and write the exact con- 
tents of arrays. In the case of disk files, 
there is no way to read this data back 
once it is written, except by using the fil- 
read procedure. That is, if you write an 
integer array to a data file, no type bj^es 
are placed in the file, just the binary in- 
teger values, one after the other. The 
same is true for text files. Normal writes 
to text files convert the binary internal 
format to ASCII character format. If you 
write to a text file using filwrite, the ex- 
act binary data is written. You can posi- 
tion the file pointer using random access 
statements, but once a filwrite starts, it 
does not respect record boundaries. 
Great care must be taken if you have any 
ideas about mixing this kind of data with 
the normal contents of text and data files. 
A good approach is to use record 0 of the 
file to document the use of filread and fil- 
write within an ordinary file by putting 
information there about the types of ar- 
rays, their location within the file, their 
length, and so forth. 

Now that we've documented how it 
works, let's look at an example which 
will demonstrate how it can improve the 
performance of your programs. 

The following program represents a 
benchmark of the time it takes to write a 
real and an integer array to a data file : 

10 DIM realarray(10,100),intarray%(10,100) 

20 OPEN#l,"test.request" 

30 REM fill arrays with random data 

40 FOR i=1 TO 10 

50 FOR j=l to 100 

60 val = RND(l)*30000:valint% = INT(val) 

70 realarray(i,j)=val:intar- 

ray%(i,j) = valint% 
80 NEXT j,i 

90 PRINT"Arrays filled." 
100 PRINT"Writing real array with FOR- 
NEXT." 

110 PRINT"Start time: "; TIMES; 
120 FOR i=l TO 10:FOR i=l TO 100 
130 WRITE#1;realarray(i,j) 
140 NEXT j,i 

150 PRINT" Stop time: "; TIMES 
160 PRINT"Writing integer array with FOR- 
NEXT." 

170 PRINT"Start time: "; TIMES; 
180 FOR i=l TO 10:FOR i=l TO 100 
190 WRITE#1;intarray%(i,j) 
200 NEXT j,i 

210 PRINT" Stop time: "; TIMES 
220 CLOSE 
230 END 

As you can see, this is a relatively 
straightforward program that writes a 
1000-element real array and a 1000-ele- 
ment integer array to disk. Apologies to 
those of you without clock chips. If you 
run this program, the timings should look 
something like this : 

)RUN 

Arrays filled. 

Writing real array with FOR-NEXT. 
Start time: 13:37:42 Stop time: 13:38:17 
Writing integer array with FOR-NEXT. 
Start time; 13:38:17 Stop time: 13:38:38 

All this adds up to about thirty-five 
seconds to write the real array, and thir- 
ty-one seconds to write the integer ar- 



ray. A great deal of this time is spent in 
the for-next loop and in writing each ele- 
ment separately. Now let's look at the 
same program using filwrite : 

10 DIM realarray(10,100),intarray%(10,100) 

20 OPEN#1,"test.request" 

25 INVOKE".dl/request.inv" 

30 REM fill arrays with random data 

40 FOR i=l TO 10 

50 FOR 1=1 TO 100 

60 vol = RND( 1 )*30000;valint% = INT(val) 

70 realarray(i,j) = val:intar- 

ray%{i,i) = valint% 
80 NEXT j,i 

90 PRINT"Arrays filled." 
95 array$="realarray" 
100 PRINT"Writing real array with FILWRITE" 
110 PRINT"Start time: "; TIMES; 
120 PERFORM filwrite(%l,@arrayS,%4000) 
150 PRINT" Stop time: "; TIMES 
160 PRINT"Wnting integer array with FIL- 
WRITE" 
165 array$ = "intarray%" 
170 PRINT"Start time: "; TIMES; 
180 PERFORM filwrite(% l,array$,%2000) 
210 PRINT" Stop time: "; TIMES 
220 CLOSE 
230 END 

Notice in the filwrite perform state- 
ments, that %1 was used to denote the 
fact that we wanted to write to file num- 
ber 1, and the string array$ first con- 
tained the array name realarray and 
then intarray%. Also, a length of 4000 was 
used in the case of the real array (1000 
elements at 4 bytes each) and 2000 in the 
case of the integer array (1000 elements 
at 2 bytes each). The result when this 
version is run is quite dramatic: 

)RUN 

Arrays filled. 

Writing real array with FILWRITE 
Start time: 13:54:45 Stop time: 13:54:48 
Writing integer array with FILWRITE 
Start time: 13:54:48 Stop time: 13:54:49 

That's right! Approximately three 
seconds were required for the real array, 
and only one second for the integer ar- 
ray, between ten and twenty times fast- 
er than the previous example. Remem- 
ber, though, that data written with this 
technique is readable only with a similar 
filread statement, and if you ever lose 
track of the way in which it was written, 
it's tough toenails. Even with those minor 
difficulties, you're sure to find lots of 
good uses for this new invokable module. 

New Stuff — Part Two. For several 
months now you've been promised some 
information about the print using capa- 
bilities of Business Basic. Rather than go 
into detail about every little feature, we'll 
take a quick look at the main features, 
and then examine a program that shows 
off some of the power ot print using. We'll 
also explore the use of the long integer 
data type for financial accounting appli- 
cations. That's a lot to stuff for one sec- 
tion, but here goes: 

Like most print using implementa- 
tions in various dialects of Basic, Busi- 
ness Basic permits the printing of a list of 
variables according to a format de- 
scribed in an image statement. In fact, if 
you have programs in Microsoft Basic,

statements, they should convert readily. 
It is in the extensions to these simple ca- 
pabilities where Business Basic really 
starts to shine. The standard format is, 
as was said, like the following: 

10 PRINT USING 20; first$,fir$tnum,secondnum% 
20 IMAGE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,XXX,####.#, 

V V V N H It II I I 

In the image statement, A reserves a 
space for one alphabetic character, X in- 
serts a blank space, # reserves a space 
for one numeric digit, and . tells Basic 
where to align and print the decimal 
point in a numeric field. Therefore, the 
example in line 20 is interpreted as fol- 
lows: 

"Print the string variable fvrst$ in the 
first fifteen positions of the output rec- 
ord, skip three spaces, then print the real 
variable firstnum with five digits to the 
left of the decimal point, and two deci- 
mal places to the right. Then skip an- 
other three spaces and print the Integer 
variable secondnum% right Justified in a 
five-digit field." 

Assuming the values "My test string" 
for firsts, 123.443 for firstnum, and -2345 
for secondnum%, the output would look 
like this: 

My test string 123.44 -2345 

Other questions, like what happens 
when the number or string is too big to 
fit, are best left to a careful reading of the 
Basic reference manual. Now the fun be- 
gins. Business Basic allows considerable 
flexibility in the way the simple example 
above can be expressed. For one thing, it 
can be simplified by placing repeat fac- 
tors on the specification characters, like 
this: 

20 IMAGE 15A,3X,5#.2#,3X,5# 

Another feature is that the image 
string can be a string value replacing the 



line number reference in the print using 
statement. The following are equiva- 
lent: 

10 PRINT USING 

" 1 5A,3X,5#.2#,3X,5#";f lrst$,f irstnum,$econdnum% 
1 0 format$=" 1 5A,3X,5#.2#,3X,5#" 
20 PRINT USING format$;flrst$,firstnum,5econd- 
num% 

It is this last variation, and the power 
it gives us to change the format under 
program control, that we will explore in 
depth a little later. 

So far we have covered the X specifi- 
cation, called a literal spec, the A spec, 
called a string spec, and the # spec, called 
a digit spec. Others available are shown 
in figure 3. 

As you can see, these options give the 
programmer quite a bit of flexibility In 
outputting information, especially in busi- 
ness and scientific applications. What 
gives even greater flexibility is the fact 
that print u^ing works with files, by us- 
ing the print usingfn form of the state- 
ment, and even works with random ac- 
cess text files by substituting print u*- 
ingiln,rec. 

One other feature of print using is im- 
portant to mention. Many business pro- 
grammers, especially in accounting ap- 
plications, must use integer arithmetic to 
ensure "penny accuracy" — no round-off 
errors from floating-point calculations. 
Ordinary Basics hamper this effort, how- 
ever, because print using cannot insert 
decimal points in integer values. Busi- 
ness Basic has a special function, used 
only in print using output lists, to solve 
this problem. The function is called scale, 
and can be used with any numeric value 
to apply a relative power of ten (decimal 
point shift) to the number being printed. 
The format looks like this: 

SCALE(5calefactor,numericvariable) 

For example, the following: 



10 longnum&= 12345678 

20 PRINT USING "7#.2#"; SCALE(-2,longnum&) 

would result in the output: 

123456.78 

To illustrate the use of these features 
in business applications, the following 
program will be used. We'll set it up to 
accept numbers with decimal points in 
them, convert them to long integers with 
a scale factor based on the number of 
places to the right of the decimal point, 
and then create a subroutine which can 
add any two scaled integers together 
without loss of precision. Finally, we'll 
set up a routine which uses scale and a 
print using spec in a string variable to 
print out the result with the correct num- 
ber of decimal places. 

First, the routine to input two num- 
bers and do the conversion and scaling: 



10 


PRINT:INPUT"First number: ";a$ 


12 


IF a$ = "" THEN END 


15 


GOSUB 905 


17 


IF errorcode THEN PRINT"Range exceeded. 




try again.":GOTO 10 


20 


scale.first% = scale%:first& = a& 


25 


INPUT"Second number; ";a$ 


30 


GOSUB 905 


32 


IF errorcode THEN PRINT"Range exceeded, 




fry ogaln.":GOTO 25 


35 


scale.second% = scale%:second&= a& 


40 


PRINT USING 45;first&,scale.first% 


45 


IMAGE " first value= ",2CW," scale factor= 




",3# 


50 


PRINT USING 55;second&,scale.second% 


55 


IMAGE "second value= ",20#," scale fac- 




tor= ",3# 


60 


END 


899 


REM 


900 


REM subroutine to convert input to long in- 




teger plus scale 


905 


errorcode = 0:ON ERR errorcode = 




ERR:OFF ERR:RETURN 


915 


x = INSTR(a$,".") 


920 


IF x = 0 THEN a& = CONV&(a$):scale 




%=0:OFF ERR:RETURN 


925 


scale% = -(LEN(a$)-x) 


930 


a$=MID$(a$, 1 ,x- 1 )-t-MID$(a$,x + 1 ) 


935 


a&=CONV&(aS):OFF ERR:RETURN 



The subroutine is really pretty sim- 
ple. It uses the trusty instr function in line 
915 to look for a decimal point in the in- 
put string. If none is found (the number is 
an integer) , then the string is converted 
to a long integer, the scale factor is set to 
zero, and a return is taken. Note that con- 
version errors (such as overflow) are 
handled by the on err statement, which 
passes back the errorcode to the calling 
program. If a decimal point is found, the 
scale factor is set to the number of digit 
positions from the point to the end of the 
string (line 925) and line 930 and 935 
scrunch out the decimal point and con- 
vert the resulting integer to a long inte- 
ger value. Once back in the input rou- 
tine, the errorcode flag is checked, and if 
everything is okay, some simple print us- 
ing statements print out the result for 
comparison. It should be noted that these 
routines are not bulletproof but were de- 
liberately kept simple to illustrate the 
major points involved.

Every Apple Is Created Equal. 
But It Doesn't Have To Stay That Way. 



An Apple is really something. 

But, from now on, it's going to be 
something much more. How come? 
Simple. We're introducing three 
revolutionary new data communica- 
tion packages, called Transend' ^\ 
designed especially to make your 
Apple 11"^^ rise above all others. 

Our Transend data communica- 
tions software provides access to in- 
formation utilities; complete file 
transmission of charts, VisiCalc'"^^ 
reports, and entire programs; as well 
as all electronic mail functions. 

Transend comes in three different 
versions. You can begin economically 
with the simplest form, Transend 1, 
an intelligent terminal/file transfer 
system. As your needs increase, you 
can move up to two other Transend 
packages, without worrying about 
retraining or repurchasing. Transend 
2 gives any Apple II intelligent ter- 
minal capabilities, plus file transfer 
with complete error detection and 



automatic retransmission for de- 
manding business apphcations. 
Transend 3 incorporates electronic 
mail— with password security, text 
editing, mailbox with mailstop, unat- 
tended scheduling and receiving, 
automatic rediahng, and much more. 



The Transformation People 



'IVansend's support of most popu- 
lar Apple II "add-in" cards and 
modems lets you upgrade your 
Apple without hassle or unnecessary 
expense. And you'll immediately cut 
operating costs by as much as 30% 
with simple, easy-to-use menus, data 
compression and 1200-baud modem 
support. 

Nobody on the personal computer 
scene today is offering the speed, flex- 
ibility, and rehabihty of Transend in 
a single upgradable software system. 

Don't miss this chance to uplift 
your Apple II. Contact us or your 
dealer for all the dehcious details.

Now that we have long integer repre- 
sentations of these decimal numbers, 
with appropriate scale factors, it is pos- 
sible to create a routine which will per- 
form arithmetic on them, even though 
they may have different scale factors. 
The following routine will illustrate addi- 
tion: 

1000 REM add a& and b& and return result in 
sum& 

1001 REM use scalea% and scaleb% to return 
scalesum% 

1005 errorcode=0:ON ERR errorcode= ERR;OFF 
ERR:RETURN 

1010 IF scalea% = scaleb% THEN sum& 
= a&+b&;scalesum% = scalea%:OFF ERR: 
RETURN 

1020 IF scalea%>scaleb% THEN 1070 

1 030 factor% = scaleb% - scalea% 

1040 b& = b&*CONV&(10Afactor%) 

1050 sum& = a&+b&:scalesum% = scalea%!OFF 

ERR:RETURN 
1070 factor% = scalea%-scaleb% 
1080 a&=a&*CONV&(10Afactor%) 
1 090 sum& = a& +b&:scalesum% = scaleb%:OFF 

ERR:RETURN 

The first thing checked for is if the two 
numbers have the same scale factor. If 
so, then simple addition is all that is re- 
quired, and scalesum% (the resulting 
scale factor from the operation) is set to 
the common scale. If the scale factors 
are unequal, then the two scale factors 
must be adjusted to be the same by mul- 
tiplying the one with the larger scale by 
the power of ten required to make them 
equal in scale. An example will clarify: 

initial number Integer value Scale factor 

12345.6789 123456789 -4 
98765.43 9876543 -2 

Obviously, just adding the two inte- 
gers will produce meaningless results. 
But multiplying the second number by 
100 and adjusting the scale factor corre- 
spondingly to -4 will make it possible to 
add them directly. The situation now 
looks like this: 

New format Integer value Scale factor 

12345.6789 123456789 -4 
98765.4300 987654300 -4 

The sum of the integer values is 
1111111089 and, after applj^ng the scale 
factor of -4, the result is 111111.1089. You 
should realize that most floating-point 
Basics, no matter how many digits they 
allow in double precision mode, have ex- 
treme difficulty with these tj^es of prob- 
lems. The reasons are complex, but they 
have to do with the fact that there are 
some decimal fractions which cannot be 
represented exactly with a binary float- 
ing-point (real) number. This leads to po- 
tential loss of precision in the last deci- 
mal place, rendering the answer inaccu- 
rate. While one place out of ten or fifteen 
might not be critical in an empirical 
scientific calculation, accountants are 
fussy about all the pennies (or in the ex- 
ample above, tenths of mils) adding up 
exactly. Note also that scale factors can 
just as easily be positive. That is, 
567890000 could be represented as 56789 
with a scale factor of 4. The principles of 
addition would work exactly the same as 



in the example with decimal fractions. 

With the techniques described above, 
you can now figure out the way the sub- 
routine works. One final note, though. In 
line 1040 and 1080 we use an expression 
"10Afactor%" to represent the power of 
ten to be multiplied by the long integer 
value. Mixed mode expressions are not 
allowed between long integers and other 
data types, so the convd function was 
used first to convert the power of ten ex- 
pression to a long integer. 

Now that we have a subroutine which 
will correctly add two scaled numbers, 
we can put it into our previous input pro- 
gram. The combination looks like tWs: 

5 PRINT"Test of extended precision add 

routines":PRINT 
10 PRINT:INPUT"First number: ";a$ 
12 IF 0$="" THEN END 
15 GOSUB 905

25 INPUT"Second number: ";a$ 
30 GOSUB 905 

32 IF errorcode THEN PRINT"Range exceed-

35 scale.second% = scale%:second&= a& 
40 PRINT USING 45;first&,scale.first% 
45 IMAGE " first value= ",20#" scale fac- 
tor= ",3# 

50 PRINT USING 55;second&,scale.sec- 
ond% 

55 IMAGE "second value= ",20#," scale fac- 
tor= ",3# 

60 scale% = scale.first%:scaleb% = scale.sec- 
ond% 

65 a& = first&:b& = second& 
70 GOSUB 1010 

72 IF errorcode THEN PRINT"Range of pre- 
cision exceeded, try again.":GOTO 10 

75 PRINT"sum= ";sum&;" scale factor= 
";scalesum% 

105 GOTO 10

1080 a&=a&*CONV&(10 Afactor%) 
1090 sum& = a&-l-b&:scalesum 

% = scaleb%:OFF ERR:RETURN 

Notice that, in addition to adding the 
subroutine at line 1000, we have some 



FEBRUARY 1982 



code at 60 through 105 to set up the call to 
the subroutine and then print out the re- 
sults. This is all fine, but this was sup- 
posed to be an exercise in advanced uses 
of the print using statement. An ideal use 
of print using here would be to print out 
the results of the addition, with the deci- 
mal point in the proper place. But, since 
our answers can range from nineteen 
digits to the left of the decimal place to 
nineteen digits to the right, and only a to- 
tal of thirty-two positions are allowed in a 
single numeric image field, it is not pos- 
sible to create a single format which will 
handle all possible variations. Here's 
where Business Basic's ability to have 
variable format definitions really comes 
in handy. The following routine can be 
added to the program above to print the 
result correctly, no matter what the scale 
factor: 

80 x% = LEN(CONV$(sum&)):neg%=CONV 

%{sum&<0) 
85 IF x%+scalesum%-neg%< = 0 THEN 

form$="2r:ELSE:form$=CONV$(x%-(- 

scalesum% )-(-"#" 
90 IF 5calesum%>=0 THEN 97 
95 form$ = form$-|-"."-|-CONV$(ABS(scalesum 

%))+"#" 

97 PRINT "scaled result of sum:"; 
100 PRINT USING form$; SCALE 
(scalesum%,sum&) 

Line 80 gets the length of the number 
to be printed in x% and neg% is a flag to 
tell if the number is negative (the minus 
sign will require an extra position in the 
output) . Line 85 uses this information, in- 
cluding the value of scalesum%, to figfure 
out how many positions are needed to the 
left of the decimal point. Line 85 then 
creates /orm^, the output format specifi- 
cation, to match. Line 90 checks to see if 
scalesum% is positive (if value is a true 
integer). If so, it's finished. Otherwise, 
line 95 creates the rest of the format spec 
by including the proper number of posi- 
tions to the right of the decimal point. 
Lines 97 and 100 then print out the long in- 
teger using the scale function to place the 
decimal point properly. 

Voila ! This routine should give exact- 
ly correct answers over its range of 
values. One thing you might want to add 
to help in tracing what the program is do- 
ing is to print out the value otform$ along 
with the result in line 100. Also, for your 
personal entertainment, you might want 
to create subroutines for subtraction and 
multiplication. Division can be done us- 
ing a combination of the div and mod 
operators, but you will become em- 
broiled in what to do about rounding off 
the results of certain divisions. Multipli- 
cation has the virtue of being exactly cor- 
rect within the possible range of values. 

Well, what an exercise ! Next month's 
article should be a goodie, because there 
is a lot left to explore in our favorite Ba- 
sic. If you've got a favorite subject you'd 
like to see examined, why not write in 
and suggest it. This column should be as 
useful as possible to those of you working 
with the language and creating applica- 
tions. Until March, then .... M

The Leader in Apple Graphics 



^ magician 

by Chris }ochumson, 
Mark Pelczarski, and friend 



This is the graphics package for 
which every programmer has 
been waiting. Written by three 
of the "wizards" of Apple 
graphics, it contains the same 
machine language animation 
routines that have been used to 
create some of the finest Apple 
arcade games. It also gives you the power to create 108'color screen images 
and graphic objects the way professionals do for adventure games and other 
programs that require dozens of pictures and objects to be quickly accessible 
from a minimum of space. Add to that new, "super shape tables"; a new 
approach to saving shapes that allows multiple colors, preservation of angles 
on scaling and rotation, and taking less space than standard shapes stored 
on the Apple. Extensive documentation and the same user-friendly approach 
of all Penguin Software products make the "Magician" incredibly easy to use.

a 3-D Graphics Tablet 



This incredible new device pro- 
duced by Micro Control Systems, 
Inc. functions as a standard graphics 
tablet in two dimensions, until you 
decide to expand to real-world 
3'dimensional input. Now you can 
trace 3'D objects, either real or 
imaginary, then view and modify 
them in 3-D perspective with your 
Apple computer. The 16"xl3" 
tablet comes with a customized 



by Mark Pelczarski 

Contains everything you need for de- 
signing 2'dimensional and 3-dimen- 
sional graphics with the Apple, pre- 
viously available only on expensive 
graphics computers. Create color 
screen images with lines, circles, el- 
lipses, automatic 108-coIor filling, and 
"paintbrushes". Use high-resolution 
text anywhere on the screen in dozens 
of colors. Create and edit shape tables, 
and shrink pictures for multiple dis- 
plays. Amcizing 3-D routines let you 
draw the parts of 3-D objects on the 
screen, then assemble, rotate, and edit 
them visually in true 3-D perspective. 
All the software is easy to use, even 
for the novice. Programmers can use 
the graphics, and even our machine 
language routines, in their own soft- 
ware. This one package gives you more 
than most other graphics software 
packages combined. Find out why The 
Comfjlete Graphics System is top rated

Like nothing else on the market, this unique software 
package allows you to escape the "coloring book" ap- 
proach to computer graphics, giving you a palette of 108 
colors and 96 different brushes for creating or enhancing 
color computer images. Also included is a magnifying 
mode that lets you magnify images 2 or 4 times and edit 
them point-byrpoint, a "picture packer" that lets you 
store images in a fraction of the space normally taken, and 
a set of tricks that allow you to reverse colors, perform 
mirror images, and move parts of screen images around 
and to other pictures. Special Effects is great as a stand- 
alone package -- or the perfect complement to 
The Comf>lete Graphics System. 



All products require an Apple II with Applesoft, 48K, and a disk drive.

which underwent a name change to Alien Rain, before VisiCalc 
was able to reclaim the top spot. 

December 1981 has all the appearances of also being a land- 
mark month in the poll's history. Because this month, in the 
midst of the biggest splurge of software buying in history, 
VisiCalc not only remained securely ensconced in first place, it 
trounced the opposition. No other two programs combined sold 
as many units as did VisiCalc by itself. 

The wide lead by Personal Software's bellwether program 
necessitated a change in the way Softalk's index is calculated. 
Always before, the leading program was assigned a number

nearly equal to, but less than 100 and all other numbers followed 
from that original calculation. With this month's poll, the sec- 
ond-place program is assigned the number nearly equal to 100. 
This more clearly elevates VisiCalc above its cbmpanions while 
still indicating the strength of the competitors. 

December 1981 will also be remembered fondly by certain 
software publishers who were the beneficiaries of Apple Com- 
puter's experimental family plan marketing approach. Half of 
the top ten programs were included in the family plan, although 
such sales were not included in the Softalk calculations. 

Family plan software making the top ten were Olympic 
Decathlon, Personal Filing System, Typing Tutor, Personal 
Finance Manager, and Apple Writer. It seems clear that the pro- 
grams were the beneficiaries of the increased attention focussed

on them as part of the marketing approach. 

For Microsoft, a company with its eyes on the top spot now 
that it's announced its own electronic forecasting tool to compete 
with VisiCalc, this month marked a temporary zenith in their 
penetration into the personal computer market with applica- 
tions programs. 

Not only was Olympic Decathlon second and Typing Tutor 
sixth, but they placed TASC and their Assembly Language 
Development System in the Hobby 10. 

December was an important month for the folks at Software 
Publishing Corporation as well, as they finally wrested the lead 
in database sales from Stoneware. Their Personal Filing System, 
fueled by inclusion in the family plan, dethroned DBMaster. 

PFS thus becomes the fourth database to lead the pack in 
the short period of eighteen months. First, CCA DMS was the 
leader, then Data Factory 3.0, then DBMaster. With VisiFile, 
Data Reporter, and General Manager joining Data Factory 5.0 
and DBMaster in the chase, the future looks equally as inter- 
esting and as volatile. 

December also saw the last of the bestseller regulars, other 
than VisiCalc, fall by the wayside when SubLogic's Flight Sim- 
ulator wound up thirty-second. It was the first month out of the 

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 9.0 percent of all sales of 
Apples and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in January to ascertain their sales leaders for the 
month of December. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was number of sales made — such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer retailer, and personal prefer- 
ence of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in January represented every geographical area of the continental 
United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index 
number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an 
arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correl- 
ative only for the month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index 
rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another 
month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus-or-minus 4.5 percent, which translates roughly 
into the theoretical possibility of a change of 3.11 points, plus or minus, in any index 
number.

money for the durable performer and came, oddly enough, during 
an uptick in sales. 

One old war horse that benefitted from Christmas buying 
was Space Eggs, which rejoined the list after a brief hiatus. Sir- 
ius Software, publisher of Space Eggs, also placed the highest 
flying newcomer on the list when Beer Run grabbed the blimp 
to rise to thirteenth. 

Leaders remained the same on all the specialty lists except 
Home 10, where Typing Tutor displaced Personal Finance Man- 
ager, and Hobby 10, where DOS Tool Kit displaced DOS 3.3. 

Dark Forest from Sirius Software and Hi-Res Computer Golf 
from Avant-Garde Creations cracked the Strategy 5. It's the first 
time that any Avant-Garde product has made the bestsellers. 

Zork joined Zork II on the Adventure 5 list. Empire I: World 
Builders from Edu-Ware Services/Interactive Fantasies gained 
third spot on the Fantasy 5. 

Continental Software placed two home finance packages in 
the Home 10, as Home Accountant joined Home Money Minder 
on the list. VisiTerm, Dow Jones Portfolio Evaluator, and Dow 
Jones News and Quotes Reporter rejoined the list. 

Only DOS 3.3, DOS Tool Kit, and Super Disk Copy III sur- 
vived from last month's Hobby 10. The Inspector and TASC 
rejoined the list while Locksmith, Zoom Grafix, Elementary, My 
Dear Apple, Assembly Language Development System, and Elec- 
tric Duet made the list for the first time. 

The Apple marketplace has the look of robust health as it 
ventures into the new year, with January promising perhaps the 
second biggest month in history. JM

AiPPROAGH 

When we set out to design 
games based on the Battle of Shiloh'; 
and the Battle of the Bulge, we 
knew we had to give these classic, 
favorite themes a fresh, new look 
and feel. After aJI, we've established 
a reputation in strategy gaming for 
.unsurpassed innovation, excitement 
and sophistication. 

First we put the games on the ■, 
Apple® II,* programming it perfectly^'' 
to eliminate all organizational and 
administrative headaches so you can 
give your undivided attention to 
strategy planning. 

Then we gave both games the 
realism and playability you're looking 
for. An elegant yet easy-to-use move- 
ment system for unimpeded play. 
Historical detail and accuracy for rich- 
ness and color. Hi-Res graphics that 
add even more color. Great solitaire 
scenarios against the computer. 
Zones of control. A step- reduction 
combat system. And more. ;■■ 

Finally, we threw in features 
you wouldn't expect For example. 
TIGERS IN THE SNOW has artillery 
and airpower allocations along with ■. 
fuel and supplylimitations. THE 
BATTLE OF SHILOH allows you to 
fine-tune combat strengths for each 
side, providing for the ultimate in 
play balance. It even lets you select 
risk levels and ferocity of attack (or ' 
defense). 

For $39.95 each, these are 
extraordinary games at quite an 
ordinary price. So head on down to

AND WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR 
NEW WAYS TO SAVE YOU TIME AND MOUSY. 




When ON-LINE SYSTEMS began work on SUPERSCRIBE II, we wanted to make it the 
most powerful word processor on the market. We began by puttirj in boldfacing, 
underlining, form letter capabilities, global search and replace, support of multiple disk 
drives, full macro ci-pabilit'es, generation of up to four indices, complete formatting 
capabilities, a software based keyboard buffer, full editing capability of any DOS 3.3 icxi 
or binary file (including APPLESOFT prograi.is) and all other features )OU need, for professional rd prctSamg. That was just the 
beginning. . . . 

Our next step was to make SUPERSCRIBF II hardware independent, ^o we elimins ed the lower case adaoter and the 80 column 
board. SUFERSCRIB'^ II is the only word processor on the market to c*fer true software based lower case ind a 70 column screen 
available today. 

The move that put us over the top was the introduction of printer ^pooling* which allows you to do your editing while printing, 
making your word processing time more etficient. 

With SU'^ERSCRIJiE II, w-'ve added all thr features you need, did away with all the problen s you can do without, a. d we did it all atl 
a price tK:3t you can afford-$l29.95. /
