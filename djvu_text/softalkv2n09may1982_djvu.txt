Many people think just because a computer does 
difficult things, it must be difficult to operate. Not so. 
At least not with PFS ,M and PFS: REPORT. 

PFS and PFS: REPORT let you concentrate on 
doing your work, not on working your computer. There's 
no complicated programming or computer language to 
learn. Using the PFS Series is so straightforward, you 
can learn it in as little as 20 minutes, and that's some- 
thing both experts and beginners can appreciate. 

Design your own management system, simply. 

PFS lets you arrange your information in "forms" 
you design yourself. Once you've created your form— 
with spaces for all the necessary data— you simply fill 
in the blanks. 

If you don't like the original form, PFS lets you 
change just the form, without having to totally re-enter 
the information on it. 

To use your forms, just call up the information 
you want in a variety of ways such 
as "less thani' "more than," "equal 
tor "between" or "not." You can 
even find specific charac 
ters, words, names or num 
bers. And PFS can also 
sort labels, change its 



Hardworking 
software for Apples 
that isn't a lot of work. 



40-column format to accommodate larger printouts, 
and tell you how much room you have left on your disk. 

Get more out of what you put in. 

PFS: REPORT sorts, calculates, totals, formats 
and prints presentation-quality reports with up to 9 col- 
umns, in alpha or numeric order, with automatic 
entering and justification. With your information in 
this format, you can analyze it quickly to help spot 
trends, plan and make decisions. 

A whole family of software for Apple® II and III. 

PFS consistently ranks among the 5 top-selling 
business software packages for Apples. Because you 
can use it for almost anything— from chemical analyses 
to keeping track of your wine collection, from bal- 
ancing your checkbook to computing your payroll. 
And there are more programs on the way. 

For a free, hands-on demonstration of PFS and 
PFS: REPORT, stop by your local computer store. If 
they don't have it yet, tell them to 
call Software Publishing Corpora- 
ation at (415) 962-8910. Or write 
1901 Landings Dr., Moun- 
tain View, C A 94043. 

You'll be amazed at 
howmuch you can bite off.

CONTEST: 
DIG THE DECADES 




The conglomeration of people pic- 
nicking on pages 136 and 137 represents 
some of the outstanding personalities of 
three decades, 1952 through 1982. Most 
would be known to anyone at all familiar 
with those eras; a few require some ac- 
quaintance with the Apple world. 

The person who names correctly the 
greatest number of pictured people will 
win $100 worth of Softalk's advertisers 
products. In case of a tie, the random 
number generator will labor again. 

Fill in each number on the entry list 
with the name of the person whose cari- 
cature on pages 136 and 137 corresponds 
to the numbered outline on the drawing 
on this page. 



Be sure that your answers also corre- 
spond to the list of anagrammed names 
that follows. The list is given as an assist 
but it also acts as a check to be sure you 
choose the correct name in the event that 
a person goes by more than one. 

The best way to proceed is to note the 
people you recognize immediately; then 
find the anagrams corresponding to their 
names and cross them off. When you're 
stumped on faces, begin solving the re- 
maining anagrams, looking then to fit the 
names you discover with the faces. 

Deadline for entries is June 15, 1982. 



Good luck.

puter game all rolled into one, brought 
in a load of entries. Ninety-three peo-

Sirius Contest: The Sirius folk in 
Sacramento, California, had more than a 
few laughs when they judged their very 
own contest that ran in Softalk 's Janu- 
ary issue: "Are Chet and David Sirius?" 



To enter the contest, players had to be 
somewhat familiar with Hadron, de- 
signed by Sirius 's Larry Miller. Hadron 
features hi-res animated graphics and 
smooth animation in a space chase to de- 
stroy an enemy base. Along the way, the 
player sees two chatty characters nick- 
named Chet and David; part one of the 
contest required recreating a conversa- 
tion they might have had in space. 

The Sirius rules were broad and loose 
enought not to stifle any creativity. A 
wide variety of entries came in, but Jo- 
seph Towers, of San Francisco, who in- 
corporated the conversation into a poem, 
was by far the most creative, original 
and humorous, said the Sirius judges. 
For his efforts, Towers will be awarded 
$250 from Sirius. Second place went to 
Jim Moore of Golden, Colorado, who 
wrote his entry in the form of a comput- 
er program, using the characters of tele- 
vision newscasters Huntley and Brink- 
ley. Moore will be awarded $100. 

And three more runners-up: Jeffrey 
Meyers of North Miami Beach, Florida, 
George Wright of Ocean Port, New Jer- 
sey, and Frank Weil of Larchmont, New 
York, were selected for honorable men- 
tions. They will receive any game of their 
choice from the Sirius catalog. 

The second part of this contest re- 
quired completing the game and identi- 
fying the musical theme that heralds

HOW TO USE YOUR EPSON 
WITHOUT WASTING 
COMPUTER 





Your computer is capable of sending data 
at thousands of characters per second but 
the Epson can only print 80 characters per 
second. 

This means your computer is forced to 
wait for the printer to finish one line before it 
can send the next. A waste of valuable time. 

THE NEW MICROBUFFER™ 
ACCEPTS DATA AS FAST AS 
YOUR COMPUTER CAN SEND IT. 

Microbuffer stores the data in its own 
memory buffer and then takes control of 
the printer. This frees your computer for 
more productive functions. 

PARALLEL OR SERIAL 

Microbuffer model MBP-16K is a 
Centronics-compatible parallel interface 
with 16,384 bytes of on-board RAM for 
data buffering. 

The MBS-8K is a full-featured RS-232C 
serial interface with both hardware and 
software (X-On/X-Off) handshaking, baud 
rates from 300 to 19,000 and an 8,192 byte 
RAM buffer. 

SIMPLY PLUG IT IN. 

Either model fits the existing auxiliary 
interface connector inside the Epson MX-80, 
MX-80 FIT or MX-100 without modification, 
and is compatible with standard Epson 
cables and printer control software, 
including GRAFTRAX-80. 

JUST $159.00* 

When you think how much time Microbuffer 
will save, can you afford not to have one?

New Microbuf fer II lets you use your printer 
without tying up your computer. 



Time. As an important resource 
it shouldn't be wasted. One 
such waste is in printing, where 
your computer must wait for 
your printer. Now there's a way 
to eliminate this waste. 

Introducing the 
Microbuffer ][™, a buffered 
parallel printer interface for the 
Apple ][® computer with 16K 
characters of memory (user ex- 
pandable to 32K). It accepts 
data as fast as your computer 
can send it, allowing you to use 
your computer while the 
Microbuffer ][ is in control of 
your printing. 

The Microbuffer]!, compatible 



with Applesoft, CP/M^ and 
Pascal, comes with complete 
print formatting features as well 
as advanced graphics dump 
routines for most popular 
graphics printers. 

The Snapshot™ option per- 
mits you to dump the text 
screen or graphics picture to 
the printer while any program is 

/MICROBUFFER H 



running — without interuption. 

The 16K Microbuffer ][ is 
available for $259. And the 32K 
version, for $299. The Snapshot 
option is $69. 

So why waste time while your 
computer waits for your printer? 
Ask your computer dealer for 
the Microbuffer ][ or call us for 
the name of a dealer near you.

Reliability. 

But you'll never forget Star-

Peeking at Pictures 

I have a solution for Dislocated 
Memory's dilemma that was mentioned 
in the Open Discussion section of March 
'82 Softalk. Mr. Arnold stated that long 
Applesoft programs have a nasty habit of 
extending into the memory used for hi- 
res graphics. Using lomem will not help 
rectify this situation. However, the fol- 
lowing scheme will work. 

To load a program from disk — and 
protect the area reserved for hgr and 
hgr2, place the following line in your pro- 
gram as the first line (use line number 1 
to make sure it comes first) : 

To protect hgr page 1 : IF PEEK (104) 
<> 64 THEN POKE 104,64: POKE 
16384,0: PRINT CHR$(4); "RUN name 
of file" 

To protect both hgr pages : IF PEEK 
(104) <> 96 THEN POKE 104,96: POKE 
24576,0: PRINT CHR$(4); "RUN name 
of file" 

What this one-liner really does is: (1) 
peek 104 looks at the start of program 
pointer, which normally is 2048. We want 
it to start at a location above 16384 or 
24576, therefore, (2) poke this value into 
the pointer. (3) Poke 16384 (or 24576) puts 
a 00 into the first location of the new pro- 
gram address. This is to buffer the new 
program from any other data that may 
be present. (In reality, the program 
pointer points to the location right after 
where we think it starts because the 
pointer low-order byte in 103 is a 01.) (4) 
Now that the pointer is changed, the pro- 
gram will reload at the requested start 
location. 

With this peek, poke, and print state- 
ment added to your program, the pro- 
gram will load normally, execute the 
first line, and then reload at the re- 
quested location. This allows the pro- 
gram to occupy memory from the end of 
hgr memory space to the maximum 
available. 

I know this procedure works and very 
well may save some of your readers the 
time and trouble that I had to go through. 
Max (Rich) Crall, San Diego, CA 

Tit for Tat 

To Steve Nelson and John Butler: 

I have the Apple PIE Text Editor and 
Formatter for my Apple and the Epson 
MX-80/FT printer with Graphtrax. You 
have helped me so much and I wish to 
give you some help too. 

You can mix all the print codes on one 
line. Escape-E turns on the emphasized 
print mode and escape-F cancels it. Es- 
cape-S turns on the expanded print mode 
and escape-T cancels it. You can turn 
these off and on at random and the 
mighty Epson will comply with your wish- 
es. You do need to be careful about the 
spaces with the compressed and expand- 



S S I O H 



ed mode or you will end up with too much 
space between words. Just put a space 
before the print code and then after the 
print code and you will have no problems.

Sponsorship Is a Phone Call Away 

This is a comment on reading my first is- 
sue of Softalk (March 1982). Unfor- 
tunately, the computer store where I 
purchased my Apple II does not partici- 
pate in your subscription program. This 
seems to be the rule rather than the ex- 
ception in the Chicago area (dozens of 
computer stores selling Apples, but only 
a single participating store: Data Do- 
main) . 

As a Pascal programmer (Apple Pas- 
cal) I am extremely interested in the con- 
tinuing column The Pascal Path. Is there 
any chance of this becoming a book, or at 
least of your offering reprints of all the 
columns at a nominal charge? 

A comment on a letter in the March 
1982 Open Discussion from Darrell Hun- 
saker. Regarding his comment on the 
Videx eighty-column board, my experi- 
ence is coupled with the Videx lower case 
enhancer and a Zenith green phosphor 
monitor. I personally find that this sys- 
tem produces extremely readable upper 
and lower case characters. The eighty- 
column board compares favorably with 
the forty-column output from the Apple 
on the monitor. Of course any monitor is 
a substantial improvement over a modu- 
lator and TV set combination. I picked 
the Videx over a ALS Smartterm be- 
cause of the clarity of the Videx and the 
lack of true descenders on the Smart- 
term. 

Dave Smaron, Addison, IL 

Any dealers may participate in the spon- 
sorship program simply by informing us 
of their desire to and sending in the

Tricky Lifesaver 

In response to Paul Robbins's call for 
"Help!" in your April issue, I am happy 
to inform him and others who may find 
themselves in a similar situation that 
there is hope for people who have a disk- 
ette with a damaged catalog. 

Our latest utility for the Apple, Bag of 
Tricks, includes four powerful and easy- 
to-use disk utilities, including Fixcat. 
Fixcat works on both thirteen-sector and 
sixteen-sector diskettes and will work 
fine on Mr. Robbins's VisiCalc storage 
diskette and any other diskette that has 
files that were written by the file man- 
ager of DOS (all normal diskettes). 
Fixcat checks the integrity of the catalog 
and file pointers and rebuilds, from

Future Today 

I am writing in response to Steven C. 
Helms's letter, which appeared in the 
March 1982, issue. We at South West Ed- 
Psych Services have a hardware device 
that we call the Cassette Interface that 
allows an Apple to start and stop most 
cassette machines. It plugs into the Ap- 
ple game paddle port and the cassette re- 
mote plug in a matter of seconds. This 
Cassette Interface can be purchased di- 
rectly from SWEPS or from local com- 
puter stores. Our newest educational 
software package, entitled The Reading 
Machine, uses this device to achieve the 
potential for educational applications 
which Mr. Helms foresaw. 
Marley W. Watkins, Ph.D., Phoenix, AZ 

Rocky Mountain Low 

I have been involved in personal comput- 
ing for about four years and I write and 
buy a great deal of software. In the 
course of searching for a General Ledger 
package for my business I came upon the 
Financial Partner from the Denver Soft- 
ware Company. First impressions glanc- 
ing at the documentation in the store 
were good, and a personal recommenda- 
tion from another store manager who 
had seen a demo (but never used the 
package himself) cinched the transac- 
tion. I proceeded to get the package home 
and after what seemed a fairly long 
experimentation period (documentation 
was not as complete or easy to use as I 
had thought) , I intended to open my ac- 
tual books. Much to my surprise, there 
was NO way to remove my experimen- 
tation files and, in fact, I couldn't open 
any new accounting period except the 
period directly following the closed 
experimentation period. A call to their 
hot line number confirmed my worst 
fears : 

1. Only one set of books can be run 
with the package ever. If you need addi- 
tional sets of books (personal accounts, 
business accounts, etc.), you must buy a 
separate master disk (generously of- 
fered at only $95) . 

2. No new accounting period can be 
opened earlier than an existing period. 

3. Any practice files or files that you 
decide need to be redone cannot be re- 
moved from the ledger and the data in 
them can only be negated by inputting 
offsetting journal entries for each 
change. 

4. The company's paraphrased policy 
over the phone was that it is the dealer's 
responsibility to inform you of the soft- 
ware's limitations, to demonstrate it and 
train you in its use and if you have any 
problems they should be handled by your 
dealer who will then deal with Denver 
Software. 

How any dealer can be expected to sit 
and instruct a potential buyer in the use 



of each piece of software is beyond me. 

I have never before felt driven to write 
a letter to any magazine, but I felt that 
this company's approach was so unpro- 
fessional that other businessmen and 
software purchasers should be made 
aware of this problem before commit- 
ting their money to a financial package. 

The store this package was purchased 
at has expressed its thanks for having 
this problem pointed out to them, and has 
offered to exchange my package for 
another company's package.

In November 1981 I succumbed to the 
glorious advertising promises of Sands of 
Mars and Fantasyland 2041. Due to their 
policy of no CODs I plied the plastic and 
paid the price. I also warned them that I 
would be moving from Mississauga, On- 
tario, in February 1982 and of course they 
promised delivery long before that date. 
Well, many phone calls and letters later, 
still no-show. It's likely just as well; I 
have learned a valuable $150 lesson. To 
hell with mail-order unless it's COD. And 
may Crystal find my money and my 
disks where the sun never shines.

Lonely Hearts and Blue Snakes 

The microcomputer software industry is 
a very young one attracting all types of 
individuals — some good and some bad. I 
would like to tell your readers about my 
experiences with one of each kind. On the 
negative side, I have had nothing but 
problems with Crystal Computer. I es- 
pecially wish to alert readers in any deal- 
ings they may have with them in their 
"User's Club." If you send them a disk, 
public domain software, and several dol- 
lars, they promise to send back a disk of 
other public domain programs. This I did 
last July. They took my disk, programs, 
and quickly cashed my check but they 
have refused to return the promised soft-

SDS Presents "The Professional" Series 



For the first time ever, three packages 
encompassing all major Apple 
operating systems: 

• ASCII Express "The Professional™ 
for Apple DOS 

• P-Term "The Professional™ for Apple 
Pascal 

• Z-Term "The Professional™ for Apple 
CP/M 

FORGET EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER 
HEARD ABOUT COMMUNICATIONS 
SOFTWARE. 

SDS now offers three new 
communication packages like no 
others on the market today. These 
packages are designed to operate 
alike, to look alike, and to be 
completely conversive with each other. 
An operator familiar with any one of 
these packages can easily operate the 
other two with minimal instruction. 
Absolutely no other packages can 
equal these outstanding features: 

• All three packages are totally 
conversive with each other. ANY 
type of file may be transferred 
completely error-free within these or 
compatible systems utilizing the 
Christensen Protocol. 

• Transfers may also include any 
ASCII based dial-up host computer. 
These flexible transfer capabilities 
are made possible by a wide variety 
of send options unique to SDS 
software. 

• Support of ALL Apple-compatible 
modems and ALL display systems 
including any 80-column board or 
external terminal; 40-column too. 

• Terminal emulation — allows your 
80-column board or external terminal 
to "emulate" screen control codes 



of other terminals. Ideal for screen- 
oriented editors or data bases. 

• Fully unattended answer mode 
features password only access and 
error-free transfer of files, as well as 
standard ASCII transfer modes. 

• All packages support up to 1200 
baud. Z-Term and ASCII Express 
support up to 4800 baud when 
interrupt-driven. 

• Greatly enhanced macro system 
now includes programmable "hand 
shaking" macros — entire log-on 
sequences may be automatically 
executed. Also, many internal 
program commands may be initiated 
from macro control. Multiple macro 
libraries may be stored for use with 
a variety of hosts. 

A NEW STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE 

"The Professional" series is so 
innovative and superior to other 
packages in the field that it is truly in 
a class by itself. Our comparison chart 
gives a detailed point-by-point analysis 
of these and other communication 
packages. Write for it. You'll be 
convinced — when it comes to 
communication software, SDS stands 
alone.

ware. I have called them three times and 
written three times. They do not return 
phone calls (the right person is always 
"out") or answer my letters. I can live 
without the software and the amount of 
money I have lost will not break me, but I 
do resent the practices of Crystal Com- 
puter. In the meantime, I have received 
several mailings from them in which 
they crow about their movie contracts, 
their staff for the software bank, and 
even a computerized lonely hearts club. 
They seem to have no time to deliver 
what they have promised. (Other letters 
to Softalk indicate that they do not feel it 
is incumbent upon them to correct pro- 
gram bugs.) Softalk readers should be 
warned about dealing with their users' 
club. (I have since turned the entire mat- 
ter over to the postal fraud authorities.) 

On the other hand, I am very pleased 
with my dealings with On-Line Systems. 
I purchased Superscribe I. There were 
several bugs in the copy I had and the 
manual was very difficult to follow. 
Several letters to staff members went un- 
answered and I finally wrote a letter to 
Ken Williams, their president. The re- 
sponse was immediate. I got a copy of the 
new version (Superscribe II) by express 
mail along with a letter of apology from 
their new customer relations manager. 
He later made several followup calls to 
make sure everything was satisfactory. 
The manual was excellent and the pro- 
gram was excellent. I had difficulty in in- 
terfacing the program to my Dynatyper 
and again they were very helpful. As a 
result, I have recommended Super- 
scribe II to others and have since pur- 
chased other On-Line programs. Now if I 
could only get beyond the blue snake.

Help for the Weary Pascal Printer 

In response to Mr. Jim Burke of Iowa 
City (Open Discussion from January 
1982 issue), who expressed his failure to 
successfully run his printer under 
Pascal — SSM comes to the rescue! 

SSM has several I/O cards for the 
Apple II computer including the AIO, 
APIO, ASIO, and AIO-II. All can be im- 
plemented- under Pascal using SSM's 
Pascal version 1.1 driver disks (part 
numbers ADD or ADD-II) for serial or 
parallel printers, modems, terminals, or 
even simultaneous usage.

Kudos to Cavalier 

The December 1981 issue contains an ad- 
vertisement on page 10 from Cavalier 
Computer. For those who haven't seen 
the ad or possibly just don't remember it, 
the ad states that Cavalier Computer is 
offering to bring the readers a free gift 
for Christmas. In essence, if the reader 
sends a blank disk to Cavalier, they will 
return it bearing a copy of Ring Raiders, 
a hi-res arcade-style game. 



Well, the ad never stated any dead- 
line date so I gave it a shot and tele- 
phoned Cavalier but, as you may have al- 
ready guessed, the offer was no longer 
available. 

Though I wasn't able to take advan- 
tage of this free goodie, I still wanted to 
take this opportunity to tip my hat and of- 
fer a special "thank you" to Cavalier 
Computer for making such an offer avail- 
able to us Apple users. 

In this day and age of high inflation 
and high competition, I think it is special 
indeed when a publishing company will 
offer any such software program for 
free. Whether the end purpose was for 



the sake of publicity and marketing 
studies, it really doesn't matter. What 
does matter is that I for one have ac- 
quired a bit more respect for Cavalier 
Computer and will look to them in the fu- 
ture when purchasing software. (By the 
way, Star Thief is, in fact, one of my 
favorite arcade games!) 

With all the controversy regarding the 
illegal copying and trading of software 
among computer users, I think that all 
publishing companies should take a good 
hard look at their own marketing/soft- 
ware publishing policies. Quite possibly 
they will find that a more give-and-take 
attitude is necessary in these times rath-

Suspicions of an Anonymous Voyee 
Please inform Mr. Olivieri to stick to 
writing columns and stay out of the 
realm of questionnaires. I don't know 
who designed this questionnaire but it 
was almost impossible to comply with; 
hence this letter. I suggest next time 
around, format it like a Reader Service 
Card. These service cards are easily 
filled out and are easy to follow. 

Your peripheral list is quite incom- 
plete. How many disks do I own? Do you 
want me to count all disks? Including 
backups? What's a package type? You 
list most of the categories to the left 
anyway. 

I've noticed throughout the question- 
naire that you're quite interested in 
whose product we own. Why? Isn't a 
printer a printer? Or perhaps you have 
been approached by manufacturers and 
they'd like to know what Softalk owners 
have in detail? 

As Bell & Howell say: "Productivity 
through information." And as Tim Bind- 
er likes to say: "Share and enjoy!" 
Knowledge is the key. 
A. Reader 

Chatting with Peter 

Some months ago you requested that 
those of us who use our Apples for busi- 
ness purposes advise you so that we 
might develop a user group with that 
orientation. I did not get around to re- 
sponding. Now that you have provided a 
survey questionnaire I have found the 
time to fill it in and am returning it here- 
with. 

A major motivation for doing so has 
been my recent experiences with Jim 
Howard's Tax Preparer, which you fea- 
ture in the March issue. The copy of my 
letter to him, dated February 24, 1982, 
will give you the background. [The letter 
told of excellent experience with Howard 
products the last two years and of ship- 
ping delays and bugs in the current ver- 
sion.] A more recent development has 
been that the second replacement disk, 
which I received on March 5, would not 
even boot. 

Jim is having the same kind of prob- 
lems that many other relatively new 
business ventures in the fast growing per- 
sonal computer industry are having. 
Fast growth coupled with rapid changes 
cause problems that are hard to cope 
with. In this case, all of the programs in 
the Howard line have needed reworking 
because of the many tax law changes. He 
is also trying to get out a new line of state 
tax programs. This effort has required 
increases in staff and long hours of work. 
Good business practices, such as return- 
ing business telephone calls and replying 
to correspondence, have not been ap- 
plied. 



Your column, I am hoping, will make 
a major contribution to the industry by 
giving it awareness of the need for ap- 
plying good business methods as well as 
good technical skills in its operations. 
Keep up the good work!

A Vote for Long Life 

I was upset that you did not include In- 
soft's excellent new language Transforth 
in the list of software to vote for in the 
January issue. It is an excellent lan- 
guage and deserves a high place in the 
poll. 

It is really a mistake to think of Trans- 
forth as a kind of Forth. It shares with 
Forth the reverse Polish syntax, but 
Transforth is a structured, compiled (not 
interpreted) language that is small and 
fast and gives you as much control over 
the Apple as assembly language. It is 
small, however, because it has no error- 
checking. Its documentation is not very 
good, but Insoft provides excellent sup- 
port and says they will soon begin work 
on a new manual with a tutorial section 
and lots of examples. 

Maybe I should not write letters of 
support for Transforth. I wrote a letter 
supporting Apple PIE once and that com- 
pany (Programma) seems to be in fi- 
nancial trouble. I hope I'm not the kiss of 
death.

Catching Up with the Times 

The November 1981 issue of Softalk car- 
ried the second portion of Richard 
Kaapke's review of clock cards for the 
Apple. In that article, he presented a cri- 
tique of the Time Machine II card of- 
fered by Creative Software Develop- 
ment of West Valley City, Utah. 

I was impressed by his description of 
the Time Machine II features and made a 
note for reference when I got around to 
buying a clock card. When that time ar- 
rived this month, I ran into some difficul- 
ties in placing an order with that particu- 
lar Creative Software Development com- 
pany. 

The information operator cannot find 
any listing for Creative Software Devel- 
opment in West Valley City, so I was un- 
able to find a more complete address by 
telephoning the company. The list of ad- 
vertisers in Creative Computing in- 
cludes Creative Software Development 
in Mountain View, California. Since it 
seemed not too unlikely that the compa- 
ny had moved since Mr. Kaapke's last 
reference, I called the California compa- 
ny. In that conversation, I was told in no 
uncertain and rather unfriendly terms 
that those people dealt only in Commo- 
dore software, and would never even con- 
sider anything relating to the Apple. 

I am somewhat at a loss. I would like 
to order a Time Machine II card but see 
no path to that end. Can you offer some 
help? Perhaps other readers have en-

Apple-Cat II is a superb 
direct modem. 

But it's a good deal more than 
that. It's a full personal communica- 
tion system that opens up the out- 
side world to your computer. 

You can access data banks. 
Swap programs. Work with your 
office computer from home. All in 
the simplest, easiest, most 
logical way. 

Programmed, 
ready-to-use. 

All functions are fully pro- 
grammed. Insert the Novation 
Apple II diskette and you're ready 
to start talking with the world. It's 
self-prompting. No homework 
needed. 

Set it on automatic 

Your Apple can run on its own 
with automatic dial, answer and 
disconnect. The system uses your 
computer memory to hold mes- 
sages, so you can send and receive 
automatically any time — including 
the late hours of the night when 
line charges are lowest. 



And the variety of speeds 
available lets you save even more. 
Switch from the standard 110 or 300 
baud to 1200 baud (it's 202 compat- 
ible) and suddenly you're moving 
data four times faster. 



New full duplex 
212 option 



212 Comware II compatible software 
package which includes current 
upgrades for the entire system. This 
can be added to existing Apple-Cat 
II cards so you can start with a 212 
or start with the basic Apple-Cat II 
and upgrade later. 



Now for the quickest, most 
convenient communication, 
212 full duplex is available. An ad- 
ditional card just slips into your 
Apple. It comes with a complete 






It's a phone. 



With automatic dial, it's a 
handy intelligent phone for regular 
use. But also, you can switch from 
voice to data at any time without 
losing the connection. 




Important "built-ins" 

The Serial RS-232 port to run 
your printer is built-in. No need 
for the expense and trouble of a 
separate card. 

A BSR controller is also built- 
in. Along with a conventional BSR 
system, it lets you control electric 

appliances, lights, 
whatever through 
your computer- 
even by phone. Add a 
real time clock and you 
can program it to be 
activated whenever you want.

what you want right now, then add 
features as your needs grow and 
change. You can keep your invest- 
ment down, yet always have the 
option to go to the full system.

An Identity for Natty 
My hopefully-not-too-late guess as to the 
location of Jim Merritt's picture is on 
page 151 — the "Turkey" looking disdain- 
fully at the edge of his coffee table. 

Incidentally, if the question at the bot- 
tom of page 107, "Who Is Natty Dread?" 
is any sort of contest I believe I have 
somewhat of an answer. The name Natty 
Dread often comes up in Jamaican reg- 
gae songs associated with the Rasta- 
farian religion. As far as I know, Natty 
Dread is not a real person, but more of a 
legendary, heroic outlaw figure such as 
Robin Hood. The "Dread" part of the 
name may or may not have something to 
do with the "dreadlocks," or hairstyle re- 
quired of Rastafarians. From what I un- 
derstand though, it is a fairly high honor 
to be or be like Natty Dread— it is a spirit 
of living inspired by a big, magnetic, 
powerful figure.

Anger Is the Mother of This Program 

In response to Softalk's March Open Dis- 



cussion, I would like to comment on the 
greatest irony facing the computer mar- 
ket today. 

In the industry's attempt to protect it- 
self from malicious copying of precious 
software or from casual piracy, pub- 
lishers have actually opened the door for 
their own bankruptcy. I can only state 
my present dilemma. In calling various 
software companies in an attempt to re- 
view various software packages for 
medical and dental office administra- 
tion, I was bluntly informed of this fact: 
if I did not put up (pay) literally hun- 
dreds and often thousands of dollars just 
to look at their software, I could just con- 
tinue looking. In other words, if I did not 
care to purchase their software sight un- 
seen, then I just cannot purchase it all. 

Correct me if I am wrong, but the old 
saying still stands even in the computer 
market, "Let the buyer beware," even to 
ask to possibly order software business 
packages for review from your local 
computer store, you will get the same an- 
swer that you received from the soft- 
ware dealer, "If you don't promise to 
buy, then don't look." 

The laugh is on them, however, since 
I cannot "review," various software 
packages for my business, I have now de- 
cided to write my own software to meet 
the medical market's needs and to do it so 
well that I truly hope to become one of 
their biggest competitors. In fact, I am so

absurdity. Maybe in this age of the com- 
puter, the saying should be, "Let the pro- 
tector beware." It is absurd for these 
software dealers actually to think that 
everyone is out to get them.

The Other-Made Man (or Woman) 

I am a software pirate. It was never my 
intention or desire to become one when I 
purchased my Apple II Plus one year 
ago. I was amazed at the problems and 
insecurity copy-protected programs 
cause. 

First, one year ago, DOS 3.3 had just 
been introduced. The copy-protectors 
were not up to speed yet and all the soft- 
ware I purchased was DOS 3.2 and had to 
be booted with the Basics disk. I paid $150 
for the then-current VisiCalc, but quick- 
ly obtained a "broken" copy I could boot 
directly with DOS 3.3. Of course, the Visi- 
Calc data disks still had to be in DOS 3.2 
format. . . . 

Second, I could not back up my soft- 
ware ! What computer user in his or her 
right mind doesn't keep a backup of all 
programs and data files? I purchased a 
nibble copier, copied everything I could 
and stored the backups where I work. 

Third, I began purchasing off-the- 
shelf, "guaranteed to work," copy-pro- 
tected software. Some had minor bugs or 
required minor changes to support my in- 
terface cards. The manufacturers said, 
"We are working on the right version for 
you," or "The manual clearly states we 
do not support that interface card." So I 
had to learn to crack the software I 
purchased. 

I began meeting others in the same 
position and now find myself among the 
software copiers and crackers. The soft- 
ware protectors have created this class 
of people. 

I am sharing with my new-found 
friends to recover the cost of the nibble 
copier, the time spent fixing bug-prone 
software, and the frustration of constant 
Basics disk usage. 

I'm still not totally happy to be in this 
position. But let me ask all your readers 
this, "Why buy a DOS 3.2 version of any 
software that you cannot backup when I 
can give you a 'broken' version that boots 
easily and backs up easily?" 

I strongly applaud Penguin Soft- 
ware's policy to release copy able soft- 
ware. I am more than willing to sign li- 
cense agreements with them not to re- 
lease a copy of any of their software I 
purchase. At last, software I can pur- 
chase and easily tailor to my own needs !

PROGRAMMING THE APPLE II 
JUST GOT EASIER! 



. A UNIX-like DOS 3.3 Compatible Operating System for the Apple II 

" ANIX 1.0 is a "Tiny-UNIX™" that is completely file structure upwards 

M compatible with DOS 3.3. ANIX incorporates a healthy subset of UNIX'S™ 
capabilities and a superset of CP/M's capabilities. In addition to the ANIX 

I operating system. Lazer provides over 30 utility programs on the ANIX disk. 
Included are: ADU (ANIX disk utility). DUPDSK, EXPUNGE, DREN, STAT, TYPE, 
PUTDOS, FREE2, UNDEL, MAKE, SIZE, MON, fiOMON. WC (word count), LC (line 

X count), PIE. PATCH, PRINT, BUILD, FIND, BTOT (binary to text conversion), IN IT, 
MAKEAUTO, PAG3, ED, COPY, SETCLK, SETPRTR, SETLOWER, SETINVMODE, TIME, and 
more! Many of the programs found on the ANIX disk are selling alone for 
between $30 and $60. Also included are the source listings for several of the 
utilties. For advanced machine_ language programmers, the source listing of 
U the entire operating system is available separately. ANIX supports powerful 

screen editing commands and will automatically time and date stamp files saved 

Ito disk (if a clock card is installed). For a complete description of ANIX's 
capabilities, call or write Lazer. 

* ANIX is the start of a complete line of system software tools available 

from Lazer MicroSystems, Inc. All new languages and applications programs 
ft available from Lazer will run under the ANIX operating system. Lazer Pascal 

U is available now. Other languages and systems are in the works. Productive 

programmers are already using ANIX, are you? 



^ The Elegance of Pascal— The Power of "C" 

_ Lazer Pascal is a unique systems programming language for the Apple II. 

0n It combines features found in Pascal and is extended to include several 

Y features found in the "C" programming language. The Lazer Pascal compiler is 

2 0 very fast (1500-2000 lines/minute) making the system very easy to use. No 

eft longer will the systems programmer or game programmer be forced to use 
assembly language, Lazer Pascal is here! 

f " Lazer Pascal supports BYTE, CHAR, BOOLEAN, INTEGER, LONG, pointer, string, 

Q array, static, and dynamic data types. Lazer Pascal was created to replace 
6502 machine language as the choice of systems and game programmers. Included 
ft with Lazer Pascal are several sample programs demonstrating the use of Lazer 
Pascal including: ANIX.P, TSTPARMS.P, LINECOUNT.P, WORDCOUNT.P, CHARCNT.P, 

I EXPAND. P, COMPRESS. P, CRYPT. P, and TRANSLIT.P. Better yet, the source 
listings for the compiler, P-code interpreter, and other utilities are 



included

Q A High-Powered 6502 Disassembler for the Apple II 

DISASM/65 produces a 6502 assembly language source listing from machine 

A code and a set of input commands. Only DISASM/65 supports all the commonly 
used data types found in machine language programs. We used DISASM/65 to 

S disassemble DOS 3.3 for our popular DOSOURCE 3.3 product — that should 
describe DISASM/65' s power! DISASM/65 is provided with our popular LISA V2.5 
assembler. Several users, however, have reported considerable success using 

M DISASM/65 with the Toolkit assembler, the SC Assembler, TED, and others; so we 
are offering DISASM/65 separately for these users.

Money-Back Blues, and Reviews 

May I comment on Dr. Hunsaker's shelf 
full of problems (March 1982 Open Dis- 
cussion). While I did not go so far over- 
board as he appears to have gone, I no 
doubt had at least one familiar disap- 
pointment, and perhaps equal time 
should be considered. 

After anxiously awaiting my Videx 
eighty-column card, there was consider- 
able distress when the advertised fea- 
tures did not appear on my screen. After 
two calls to the manufacturer failed to lo- 
cate the problem, we decided by phone to 
go at it step by step. The difficulty ap- 
peared to be more in my lack of under- 
standing the capability of the unit but, at 
any rate, the package would be of no use 
to me. So what did they say? "Let the 
buyer beware"? "Tough luck, old boy"? 
No, they said, "Send it back and we'll re- 
fund your money." And they did, even 
though I had not purchased it from them. 
Today I received a letter from On-Line 
Systems concerning a new product about 
which I had inquired. They ended their 
letter by saying, "Demonstration copies 
are not available, but we do have a mon- 
ey-back guarantee." 

Since many of us live where we simply 
cannot walk into a store and find the lat- 
est revisions of everything on the mar- 
ket, the media and software publishers 
have obligations to us. The software peo- 
ple need to offer a reasonable money- 
back guarantee and/or they could offer 
demonstration packages complete with 



sample documentation (which so often 
bombs a good program). While I'm at it, 
an 800 number for questions and an- 
swers would be a most helpful feature, 
but I could live without that for now. The 
final one goes directly to you magazine 
publishers. We need well-researched, 
well-detailed up-to-the minute reviews, 
and I do not refer to games. Too often do I 
see reviews of one package in several dif- 
ferent magazines, by equally different 
authors, that, while failing to scratch the 
surface, say the same thing, in other 
words, canned! Another matter in which 
I find fault is lack of communication be- 
tween an author (or his publisher) and 
the software house. Too often lately re- 
views have ended with "by the time you 
read this, the latest version will no doubt 
be out." Well, frankly, if I am to lay out 
anything over $100, it absolutely must be 
the latest version. 

Finally, might I address the letters 
from Captain Lee and Professor Graham 
(also March 1982). Mine was what 
amounted to missionary zeal on behalf of 
Apple. It is well that management did 
what they did because there are too 
many equal or better products coming to 
market for me to continue directing my 
friends to what may no longer be in their 
best interest.

MAY 1982 



Craig Stinson's Marketalk Reviews 
(March 1982) regarding our new release, 
The Count (A Winning Blackjack Sys- 
tem). We have decided to incorporate 
Craig's suggestion to include stats on 
high and low values in units won or lost at 
unfavorable, even, and favorable condi- 
tions. 

At the same time, I'd like to clarify a 
couple of points regarding The Count. 
The review mentions that I "part com- 
pany with Thorpe" in the area of corre- 
lating the running count with the num- 
ber of cards played and that in a six deck 
game the eccentricity of the deck can be 
significant. Personally, I prefer to in- 
clude this aspect in blackjack card count- 
ing but with The Count have tried to pro- 
vide a simple method of card counting for 
the casual player. For that reason, I 
have, over the years, instructed my 
friends in this simplistic system with 
strong warning that only single deck play 
is recommended (because of the eccen- 
tricities of multiple deck play). 

Casual players (my wife included and 
the person for whom the simple count 
system was developed) seldom wish to 
spend the time learning complex count 
systems. It is also generally difficult to 
teach people the complexities of the 
Thorpe system in one or two evenings. 
Thus, the simple count system in The 
Count, which the review did not mention, 
advocates a hand-counting system rath- 
er than a card-counting system. Many of 
our friends have learned this system in 
two evenings under our instruction and 
then have trekked with us to the casinos 
for several pleasant, inexpensive days. 
Though less accurate than complex count 
systems, The Count is extremely easy to 
learn and gives the player an advantage 
over the house. 

In the automatic play mode it is true 
that The Count employs a very bold bet- 
ting strategy. In the documentation, how- 
ever, two other betting strategies are out- 
lined. The conservative strategy is not in 
the least radical and would seldom re- 
sult in disastrous short-term losses. Since 
big winnings are also far less likely, I 
personally recommend and describe a 
controlled parlay system in conjunction 
with The Count; it seldom loses and has 
resulted in some spectacular winnings 
for me on seven or eight occasions. 

Off the subject but of possible interest 
to your readers: Saving and retrieving 
strings containing colons and commas 
can be a real problem when the disk is in- 
volved. Input statements don't like them; 
hence, the extra ignored message. By 
building the initial string using a get loop, 
A$ can be saved and retrieved contain- 
ing these no-nos if A$ is changed to A$ = 
CHR$(34) + A$ before sending it to a disk 
textfile. This "throw-away" quote mark 
trieks the Apple into the belief that all of 
the material which follows is part of a lit- 
eral (which it is? ! ?) . Try it ; you'll like it.

Mind Your 




BY PETER OLIVIER! 




Hello, again. 

Whether you plan to use your computer in an existing busi- 
ness or in starting up a new one, there are some steps you can 
follow that will help you ensure a successful implementation. 
We'll begin this month by talking about some of these. 

A Plan for Using a Computer in a Small Business: Part II. 
Let's start with something that sounds awfully theoretical. It 
can be argued that the three most important characteristics of 
good management are the ability to plan, the ability to make 
decisions, and the ability to control operations. In considering 
how to use the computer, it's a good idea to think of how the 
computer can help with these three aspects of running a 
business. 

Planning — Hardware. We all have one common starting 
point. All of us have Apples. However, this does not mean we 
have the right Apple for the business we're involved in. One of 
the first steps you must take is determining what hardware 
best meets the demands you expect to place on your computer 
system. Question one is: Do you have the right equipment? 

Finding the answer to this question calls for both some re- 
flection and some homework. Reflection is required to deter- 
mine what the future needs of the business might be, while the 
homework consists of detennining the volumes of information 
you need to make informed decisions about such things as in- 
put, output, and storage devices. Given that most of us have 
Apple lis or II Pluses with at least one disk drive, it might be 
quite important to consider the following kinds of questions: 

Would a different Apple (that is, the Apple III) be a better 
machine for your purposes? This machine has more main 
memory, a specially designed keyboard, and a variety of other 
features that are oriented toward business applications. 

What disk drive arrangement best suits your needs? If you 
use floppy disks, you really need a minimum of two disk 
drives. Even with two drives, you may end up having to do a lot 
of disk swapping if you have extra large data files. Perhaps a 
hard disk will be necessary. 

Will you need additional hardware to provide for backup? 
For example, if you do choose to use a hard disk, it is some- 
times necessary to have a floppy disk drive to prepare back- 
ups. Some backup procedures use videotape, so you might 
even need a videotape recorder. 

What kind of printer do you need? Printers come in all 
shapes and sizes and offer various combinations of capabili- 
ties. Some factors to consider concerning a printer are : 

1. Do you need a letter-quality printer? 

2. Will you need a printer that can print graphics? 

3. What size paper do you need (80-column width or 132- 
column width) ? 

4. Do you expect to need different types of paper (labels, 
checks, envelopes, letterhead, and so on) ? If so, you'll need a 
sprocket feed (also called a pin feed) printer. 

5. Would you like to have the option of printing in different 
colors? Some of the printers that have been released recently 
offer a four-color option. 

6. Will the noise associated with a printer present a prob- 
lem? If so, you'll want to get either a silent (thermal type) 
printer or one with a sound-deadening cover. 

7. What kind of print options do you need? Do you want pro- 
portional spacing, different type fonts, or larger than usual 
letters? 



8. Will you need a single-sheet feeder? This is an attach- 
ment that allows you to feed single sheets of paper into your 
printer. If you are planning to print on company letterhead, 
this attachment is a must. 

What miscellaneous equipment do you need or want for 
your particular application? Some forms of equipment you 
might consider are a graphics tablet for preparing charts and 
graphs; a communications card and modem to use in inter- 
facing with another computer or in connecting to an informa- 
tion utility source ; and a monitor that allows you to view what 
is being input and output. In the case of the monitor, you'll need 
to decide whether you need a color monitor or a black and 
white, and whether it should be high resolution or low resolu- 
tion. You'll also need to consider screen size and whether you 
want a tinted screen (much easier on the eyes) . 

Here are some other areas to consider when you're think- 
ing about what equipment you need for computerizing your 
business. 

1. What furniture do you need? This area is often over- 
looked, despite its importance to the health of both computer 
and operator. A sturdy desk, perhaps one designed to ac- 
commodate the computer, disks, monitor, and printer, should 
be seriously considered. 

2. Will you need security devices? Microcomputers are 
quite attractive and easily transportable. Once yours has been 
stolen, it's too late to do anything about it. 

3. What sort of disks will you use? What brand? How many 
will you need? Those with a reinforcing ring around the center 
of the disk are best. In addition, the disks will have to be stored 
somewhere. You should consider getting either three-ring 
binder holders or a floppy disk file. Keeping your disks in a 
dust free environment prolongs the life of both disks and disk 
drive. 

4. What will you need for connecting to a power source? Do 
you have grounded outlets available? Are the outlets being 
used on an isolated line? Will you require a power-surge 
controller? 

5. Will any of your applications require the use of a joy- 
stick, paddles, light pen, or bar code reader? 

6. Do you want your screen to display eight columns of in- 
formation instead of the unmodified Apple's forty? If so, you'll 
have to add a board. 

7. Do you anticipate needing more memory? For exam- 
ple, if you have a 32K Apple, you may find that some pro- 
grams you'd like to use won't run on your machine as it is. A 
very large VisiCalc application, for instance, may require ad- 
ditional memory. 

8. Should you consider expanding the potential of your ma- 
chine by adding a language card or the CP/M operating sys- 
tem? These cards do increase significantly the amount of soft- 
ware that will run on your machine, and it's likely we'll dis- 
cuss them further in a future column. 

As you can see, there's much to consider when planning for 
a computer application. Note how important it is to consider 
not only the present needs of your business, but also its future 
needs. What might you need next month? Next year? Five 
years from now? Remember the four Ps: planning prevents 
poor performance. 

Planning — Software. Planning for equipmt nt is only part of 
the planning process involved in computerizing your business.

Equipment, no matter how suited to your needs, will do 
nothing without computer programs, that all-important soft- 
ware. The two most important questions you must ask your- 
self are: Where will you get your programs? What programs 
will you get? 

There are three ways in which programs are most com- 
monly obtained. First, you can write them yourself; second, 
you can purchase programs that have already been written by 
others ; and third, you can hire a consultant or programmer to 
write original programs for you. 

Most of us won't (and probably shouldn't) write our own 
business programs. Those of us who have written programs 
ourselves know that programming can be a demanding and 
sometimes tedious task. Writing a program often starts out to 
be a very simple thing and then grows into something in- 
credibly complex. Unless you've had some experience writing 
programs or have the time and patience to work quite hard at 
it, this option is not for you. 

Programs that have been written by others will often fit 
your needs just perfectly. Take mailing list packages, for ex- 
ample. Ninety-nine percent of all mailing list applications have 
the same requirements. A standardized package that accom- 
plishes your list processing needs can probably be obtained 
quite easily. Other commercial packages will fill many of your 
specific needs. The task here is to determine exactly what it is 
that you need and what it is that the package will provide, a 
theme we'll consider in more depth later on. Of course, there 
will be times when an existing package either does not meet 
your specifications or must be modified to be of any use to you. 
In cases like this, it is probably best to go for the third option, 
hiring a programmer or consultant to create programs for 
you. 

Lots of people know how to program. Lots of programmers 
program very well; lots don't. If you're going to employ a con- 
sultant or hire a programmer, take your time in the selection 
process. Go for experience, not necessarily price. Ask to see 
some of the programmer's previous work. Talk to someone the 
programmer has done work for. This person will have con- 
siderable influence on what happens in your business once he 
or she gets started, so be sure before you begin. 

Remember, you are not a computer expert, but you should 
do everything possible to become knowledgeable about com- 
puters, programming, system design, and software evalua- 
tion. Otherwise, you are indeed in the hands of whoever 
designs your system. Some of you may be comfortable with 
this; others will not be. At the very least, be involved in the 
design of the programs you commission. Ask questions, 
provide sample data, test programs well, and demand thorough 
documentation. 

Your next question about software is likely to concern what 
applications (or canned packages) you ought to consider. This 
is, of course, a question that cannot be answered for you. 
Rather, you must answer it yourself by determining what ap- 
plications you are willing to put on the computer, what appli- 
cations you can put on the computer, and what applications 
you must put on the computer. 

Don't try to do everything at once. At first, just make an ef- 
fort to identify all the applications that are candidates for com- 
puterization. Next, set some priorities as to which of these will 
be the first you implement. Start with a small, manageable ap- 
plication with which you are thoroughly familiar. If it's an ap- 
plication you know well, you can use it as a means of learning 
more about your computer system. 

It might be interesting to look at the areas in which you 
might use the computer. The following list is representative of 
where business users tend to concentrate their automation ef- 
forts: 

maintaining mailing lists 
maintaining customer lists 
recording accounts receivable 
recording accounts payable 



word processing (including report preparation, 

letter writing, and so on) 

estimating the cost of a job 

maintaining a payroll 

electronic worksheet analysis 

project scheduling 

chart preparation (graphics applications) 

financial forecasting 

tax record keeping 

inventory control 

maintaining a catalogue 

performing sales analyses 

maintaining price lists 

This list can be expanded even further, of course, but the 
applications shown represent those most in demand. Looking 
over the list might give you some ideas as to what activities in 
your organization might be done on the computer. 

We'll continue next month with a guide to planning for new 
(or additional) computer applications. Topics will include 
planning for growth, personnel needs, data preparation re- 
quirements, and planning for the eventual implementation of 
your system. 

Product Review. One of the markets with great potential 
for growth is the home market. The first application of the 
"home" computer was games. Next, we began to see applica- 
tions programs for home money management — in particular, 
checkbook-type programs that help people balance their per- 
sonal books. Apple's Personal Finance Manager and The Ac- 
countant are examples of programs from this category. 

Now it's time to make way for a new arrival — The Home 
Accountant from Continental Software (16724 Hawthorne 
Boulevard, Lawndale, California 90260) . Those of you who read 
the Home Finance Roundup in last month's issue are already 
somewhat familiar with this program ; because of its versatili- 
ty, it merits coverage in this column as well.

MAY 1982 



To use this program, you must have a 48K Apple II, one or 
more disk drives, and a printer (the printer must have the 
standard Apple interface) . As you shall see, this package is far 
more than a checkbook balancer. The Home Accountant al- 
lows you to find out what you are worth and to keep good rec- 
ords of home finance matters. 

An Accounting of the Home Accountant. This well-thought- 
out package allows the user to do the following things : 

1. Maintain up to one hundred budget accounts. 

2. Keep track of up to five different checkbooks. 

3. Print out checks. 

4. Print a personal balance sheet that shows net worth. 

5. Produce an income and expense report. 

6. Keep up to one hundred transactions on a single disk. 

7. Automatically post transactions each month. 

8. Divide up a check and spread over several categories. 

9. Identify certain categories as tax categories and recall 
them later. 

10. Search for transactions using a variety of criteria (date, 
check number, and so on). 

11. Create and display graphs (bar graphs, line graphs, 
and trends analyses) . 

12. Produce a variety of account activity reports. 

As you can see, this is a fairly comprehensive package. The 
program's authors suggest that it will take thirty-five to forty- 
five minutes each month to maintain your financial records in 
this fashion. While this sounds like somewhat of an underesti- 
mate, it's true that maintaining your financial records using 
The Home Accountant will certainly take you far less time 
than would be required if you were to do the same thing 
manually. 

Be advised that you will have to invest some time in the be- 
ginning gathering data for initial entry into the system. You 
will have to designate categories in which to place all of your fi- 
nancial information (assets, liabilities, credit cards, income, 
expenses) , and this will be a lot of work. As is the case with 
most things, however, the success of this venture is directly 
proportional to the amount of "up-front" work you put into it. 

The user's guide begins by defining all the terms used in its 
pages; thus, you do not need a graduate degree in finance to 
understand what's going on. In addition, there are plenty of 
examples throughout, and the authors provide helpful hints 
every now and then that aid the reader in working with the 
program. 

The screen formats are pleasing, clear, and concise. One 
particularly nice feature is that each screen has a comment on 
it that refers the user to the page in the guide that deals with 
the options listed. The section describing the various graphics 



options could be improved; it would be significantly enhanced 
by the inclusion in the manual of actual graphs. 

This is a good package. It demands a certain amount of 
discipline on the part of the user, such as requiring that data be 
entered regularly throughout the month, so those of us who 
tend to procrastinate would have some adjustments to make. 

If you're considering the acquisition of a home financial 
package, be sure to ask your dealer for a demonstration of The 
Home Accountant. 

The Readers Speak. "I enjoy reading your column (in par- 
ticular the product reviews) . I especially liked the chart you in- 
cluded in an earlier column that listed all the characteristics of 
the database management packages. This was very useful to 
me in comparing one package with another. Would it be possi- 
ble for you to do the same with other packages?" F. B. C, Las 
Vegas, Nevada. 

Tables that summarize the characteristics of different 
packages are very useful. What makes such comparisons dif- 
ficult is the fact that these packages don't arrive in what might 
qualify as megapackages. Thus, it often takes quite some time 
to look at all the current programs in a particular category. 
Mind Your Business will regularly include such summaries af- 
ter enough of a given type of package has been reviewed to 
make it worthwhile. 

Coming Attractions. Over the next few months, this col- 
umn will include an extensive review of the Apple III. After all, 
the III was intended for the business market and, since its re- 
release, it has been quite favorably received. We'll take a good 
look at its advantages as a small business computer as well as 
comparing and contrasting it to the Apple II. If it turns out that 
the Apple III is the best version of the Apple for business users, 
we might collectively pursue how to trade up from an Apple II 
to an Apple III. As part of our review of the III, we'll also be 
looking at some of the software designed for this machine. 

In the meantime, it's becoming apparent that business 
users need to give serious consideration to the possibility of ac- 
quiring a hard disk. It simply makes more sense to have larger 
storage capacity, faster data retrieval, and efficient backup. 
The hardware is there, and the associated costs are becoming 
more reasonable. Thus, we'll spend some time considering the 
advantages (and disadvantages) of using a hard disk. 

Since one of the more common applications of the Apple is 
word processing, we'll be putting together a tutorial and glos- 
sary on word processing software and systems. Included in this 
column will be a chart that lists the salient characteristics of 
each of the packages currently available for the Apple. 

Once again, thanks for following along with this month's 
musings. See you again soon. Hi

MAY 1982 





The Schoolhouse Apple 

byJeanWven 



It can't think for itself. It's dumb. 

It will do only what you tell it to, they say; no more, no less. 
It's so literal. 

Turn it off (or be the victim of a power outage) , and you 
may have to teach it all over again. In some ways, it just never 
learns. 

They're right, you know, absolutely right. This miniature 
wonder of the modern world can't think. Why, then, do these 
same people have (or want) one, or more than one, in their 
schools, their businesses, their public libraries, their living 
rooms? Why do they hail its excellence as an educational tool? 

A cursory look around confirms that there is indeed an 
ever-growing enthusiasm among educators, among students, 
and among the computer-using public for the microcomput- 
er's potential to assist our learning and expand our educa- 
tional horizons. The state of New Hampshire has declared the 
week of May 3 to be Computer Education Week and plans on 
celebrating with a microcomputer fair. In announcing their 
Second Annual Conference this past February, Talmis, a ma- 
jor market research firm for the data processing/communi- 
cations industry, predicted that by 1985 microcomputer soft- 
ware sales to the educational marketplace would reach $75 
million. It's evident that the microcomputer is being seen by 
many as an educational tool with no limits to its usefulness and 
versatility. 

Keeping Pace with Our Companions. The action in the edu- 
cational computing field and the development of software for 
use in schools, homes, and businesses is catching up to the rest 
of the fast-growing, ever expanding microcomputer industry. 
It seems appropriate indeed that this year's Talmis confer- 
ence bore the subtitle, "The Courseware Industry Gets on Its 
Feet." 

This growth and movement is exciting to witness and take 
part in but it brings with it problems and challenges. The in- 
dustry is young. Standards for evaluating the effectiveness of 
computer-assisted instruction in general and of applications 
software in particular have not yet been set or are not well 
known or widely agreed upon. And, as with other aspects of the 
information explosion, there's the problem of how to keep up 
with everything that's going on. 

Stated simply, we can't. Too much is happening too fast. In- 
stead, as we strive to be informed consumers and creators of 
educational software and microcomputer technology, our task 
involves developing discernment in various areas. To do 
this, we need one another's help, both in arriving at standards 
to judge materials by and in learning to delineate what infor- 
mation we really want to know and make use of. 

In the opening remarks of the ADCIS (Association for 
the Development of Computer -Based Instructional Systems) 
brochure, Michael W. Allen, president of this international or- 
ganization, articulates the current mood and the imperative 
task: "The recent widespread availability of computers has 
led to a sometimes maddening rush to explore their potential 
for instructional uses. Never before has there been such a need 
for accurate information and the exchange of knowledge and 
inventions." 

Breadcrumbs and Bridges. In this column, one of our main 
goals will be to make it easier for you to find your way around 
in the seeming labyrinth, to grasp the esssntials amid the over- 
load of this aspect of the information explosion. We plan to do 
this in a variety of ways. 



In terms of educational software for the Apple, we'll keep 
you informed about who's doing what, by means of reviews 
and announcements. Sometimes, we'll review software for a 
particular subject area from a number of companies; other 
times, we may talk about the educational philosophy of a par- 
ticular company as reflected in the software it produces or 
creates. Occasionally, we'll also announce software programs 
and packages designed to simplify school administrators' 
lives. 

We'll let you in on applications we learn about that may in- 
terest or even inspire you to use your Apple in new ways to aid 
your children's learning and your own. We'll tell you about 
educational organizations, publications, and other resources, 
as well as conferences and other gatherings you'll want to 
know about. 

We'll consider what the present happenings and develop- 
ments portend for the future of education and learning. 

We'll also discuss computer literacy — what is it, any- 
way? — how to evaluate software, what educators and re- 
searchers have to say about effectiveness of computer-assist- 
ed learning, and so on. 

We'll introduce you to evaluation systems that educators 
and educational organizations (Microsift, Talmis, and others) 
have arrived at, and attempt to define standards of our own 
that take these expert views into account. 

We'll also consider such important topics as how to bridge 
the information gap many parents and children experience 
when the children are using computers or learning program- 
ming at school and the parents are exasperated over comput- 
er-generated bills and other frustrations. 

We plan to talk about courseware generators and author- 
ing programs — what do they do for you and how? How diffi- 
cult is it to learn to use them if you're an educator? And what if 
you're not? We'll also keep you abreast of new interactions of 
technology — the computer/video disk interface in education, 
for instance. 

But mostly we'll be offering you selected information. Sift- 
ing through information that reaches us, we'll attempt to dig 
out and present the information you want most. 

Meet the Press. As a step. toward that end, each month we'll 
provide capsule views of various companies we're acquainted 
with who produce educational software for the Apple. You've 
probably read about or purchased learning materials from 
some of these companies ; others may be new to you.

ing learners become conscious (and more in command) of the 
visualization processes they use in learning. NLP techniques 
help people direct their eye movements in ways that facilitate 
the learning process. Programs include Spelling Strategy and 
Math Strategy (both distributed by Apple Computer's Special 
Delivery Software, Cupertino, CA) and a composition pro- 
gram designed to unlock writer's block. This is done by using

teach reading to children at grade levels one through eight. 
Created by a team consisting of an educator/reading special- 
ist, an experienced software programmer, and a data-pro- 
cessing training consultant, the curriculum package provides 
remediation for student difficulties in up to forty reading skills 
and one hundred sixty subskills per grade level. The company 
has plans to release similarly designed curriculums in mathe- 
matics and language arts. 

Creative Thinking Nourished Here. The organizations and 
special interest groups in the educational microcomputing 
field are many. They offer you support and need yours. We 
plan to introduce you to at least one each month. 

One resource well worth knowing about is the Apple Edu- 
cation Foundation (20525 Mariani Avenue, Cupertino, CA 
95014). Established three years ago, this independent agency 
encourages creative thinking and innovative applications of 
microcomputer technology to the educational process. 

The foundation attempts to have an impact on education in 
three main ways: first, through a grant program that gives fi- 
nancial aid to people who are developing new methods of learn- 
ing through the use of small computers; second, through its 
Educational Program Evaluation Centre, and third, by means 
of an impressive new publication, The Journal of Courseware 
Review, edited and published by Carolyn Stauffer. 

Published quarterly, this beautifully designed journal is an 
information source that will help educators and home users 
alike to evaluate educational courseware. The premiere issue 
(volume 1, number 1) features in-depth reviews by subject- 
area experts of software programs in music theory, science, 
beginning Basic, and more. It includes also an informative ar- 
ticle on evaluating educational courseware by Joyce Hakans- 
son, the director of computer development at Children's Tele- 
vision Workshop. If the first installment is any indication (and 
we think it is) , the journal will be a valuable reference manual 
for people who want useful, thought-out, well presented infor-

mation about software programs and the course of the educa- 
tional software industry. The journal is available at many mi- 
crocomputer retailers or directly from the foundation. 

Over the last three years, nearly a million dollars has been 
awarded by the foundation to help support some one hundred 
fifty courseware development projects in a variety of disci- 
plines. Foundation members are hopeful that the courseware 
generated by these projects will affect the quality of educa- 
tional courseware by initiating standards of excellence for 
other programs to live up to. At present, courseware develop- 
ment projects are being funded in bilingual and foreign lan- 
guage education, business/economics, computer literacy, en- 
gineering, fine arts, health sciences, library sciences, mathe- 
matics, museum interaction, psychology, reading, science, so- 
cial studies, and special education. 

Among the research areas that are of special interest to the 
foundation this year are projects that propose to develop 
courseware for teacher training, vocational education, and mi- 
crocomputer maintenance/training. Simulations, and pro- 
grams that help people generate their own courseware, will 
also be given high priority by the Foundation. 

Conference Calendar. The Seventh Annual West Coast 
Computer Faire held March 19, 20, and 21 at San Francisco 
Civic Auditorium featured special seminars intended for edu- 
cators and others with an interest in educational computing is- 
sues and applications. 

The morning session featured multiple presenters and fo- 
cused on preschool computing. 

Included in a two-part afternoon seminar was a talk by 
Vicki Carver, an educator from Des Moines, Iowa, offering 
recommendations for Logo learning centers. A key point in 
Carver's presentation was the idea that children who are 
learning Logo often present programs that are based on really 
good theories (and really good thinking) , even though the pro- 
grams themselves won't run. She stressed the importance of 
realizing the thinking process behind a child's programming 
attempts and affirming it, rather than short-sightedly dis- 
missing the worth of the child's reasoning process. 

A highlight of the two-part event on educational computing 
was the presentation by Mary M. Humphrey of Teaching 
Tools: Microcomputer Services (Box 50065, Palo Alto, CA 
94303). Titled "Benefits of Using Computers in Special Educa- 
tion," Humphrey's talk focused on the positive things that can 
happen when microcomputers are used with hyperactive and 
learning-disabled children. 

Humphrey enumerated the objections many people voice 
about the use of computers with handicapped learners (such 
things as, "They have problems with social skills already — 
don't isolate them further," and, "These kids have attention 
problems — how will they ever learn to use a computer?") and 
pointed out that in her experience the computer began to rem- 
edy many of the problems that others had feared that it would 
aid and abet. The social skills, individual attention spans, and 
motor skills of her students actually improved. And micro- 
computers are ideal for working with children who have prob- 
lems paying attention — these patient teachers can wait around 
nonjudgmentally just about forever and can move as fast as 
the child is ready to move. 

But Humphrey's main emphasis was on how learning-han- 
dicapped kids felt about themselves after using the computer 
and about the influence this had on their attitudes toward 
learning. Their self-images improved tremendously; they be- 
gan thinking of themselves as competent. They began to iden- 
tify themselves with the computer and to see that they were 
the managers of their own learning, masters of their own fates, 
in control — the computer did what they told it to do, and was an 
extension of their capacity, not superior to it. 

The message in Humphrey's remarks is applicable to the 
benefits of microcomputer-aided instruction for all learners. It's 
true; computers, even magnificent micros, aren't smart. But 
we are. And microcomputers are tools we human beings use; 
with their aid, we can become smarter, extend ourselves, use 
our brain power to the fullest. IC 



Why does EDU WARE bother 



to capture 
a moment 
in 

time? 

Decause the single most 

valuable tool in any 
instructor's repertoire is a 



moment of the learner's 
attention — when eyes are open 
and interest is high. That 
moment is too valuable to waste 
playing games. With this in 
mind, we design Edu-Ware 
instructional systems and craft 
Edu-Ware screen displays to 
capture that moment for all it's 
worth. 

The Al gebra Series and 
Edu-Ware® Fractions and 



Edu-Ware® Decimals illustrate 
the results of this design process. 
While the systems share solid 
instructional principles, their 
screen displays have been 
developed to meet their 
respective conditions of learning. 
Fractions and Decimals use color, 
graphics, and animation to link 
the mathematical with the 
concrete. Al gebra focuses on the 
logical operations between 
abstracts. 



Upper/lower case and 
double-sized fonts are 
clear and easy to read.

The animated figure in Edu-Ware® Fractions and

An Odyssey to Apventure 



BV DAVID HUNTER 



Ann and Bob Clardy loaded up their station wagon with 
computers and software and went south. They drove straight 
down from Seattle to San Francisco and immediately began 
setting up their booth for the Fifth Annual West Coast Comput- 
er Faire. 

The two of them looked at many strange things and met 
many strange people at the fair. They wandered through the 
labyrinth of booths and exhibits; they got sick and hoarse, ex- 
hausted and feverish. Bob's original Apple II, circa 1978, was 
stolen and they didn't even realize it until later. 

This was the Clardys' first big exposure to the wild and un- 
ruly legions of buyers that can make or break a software 
company. 

The Clardys met dealers and distributors; they made 
enough money to break even on the expenses of going to the 
fair. The Clardys went back to Seattle physically drained, but 
they had seen the future. 

Ann and Bob own and operate Synergistic Software in Ren- 



ton, Washington. In January 1980, Bob Clardy began writing 
Odyssey, his most successful game to date. 

Two long and stormy years later finds Clardy planning the 
sequel to the sequel to Odyssey. Ann Dickens Clardy is devot- 
ing a great deal of time to caring for their five-month-old son 
Derek. 

The Big Time. It takes the courage of the Light Brigade to 
exhibit at a fair the size of San Francisco's annual madhouse. 
Yet new companies have to crawl out of their isolated lairs and 
show themselves to public and peers, for better or worse. 

Even greater courage is required to make that first move 
and start a company from scratch. After you've accomplished 
that, the next part seems easy. Ann and Bob may not think it 
was so easy, after their San Francisco experience, but learn- 
ing the laws of the jungle is the only way to survive the peril- 
ous search for fame and riches. 

Few people would argue that there aren't enough bums in 
the world. Many more people might argue that there are too 
many software publishing houses. Synergistic has seen a lot of 
competitors come and go. 



Clockwise from upper right: Ann Clardy, chief executive officer and quality control; Will Clardy, director of marketing; Ron Aldrich, programmer; 
David Kampschafer, programmer; Becky Clardy, production coordinator; Mike Branham, manager of software services and 

support; Bob Clardy, founder and chief programmer. 



How is it that two unassuming, likable people got em- 
broiled in, as Daffy Duck might say, the despicable business of 
publishing software? It's funny the way people get entangled in 
this highly competitive profession. They bring it upon them- 
selves. 

No Different. Bob was bored with designing radar and Ann 
was sick of accounting. The prospect of going wacky working 
on AW ACS the rest of his life led Bob to pursue an old love 
from his college days, computer programming. Ann, his other 
love from Rice University, had remained with him all along. 

One fateful day in September 1978, Bob bought an Apple. 
Here at last was the chance to learn more about the wild and 
wonderful world of programming. Clardy dived in. 

In true beginner's fashion, Bob thumbed through the 
legendary red manual and tinkered with the provided listings. 
Relaxing after a tough day at Boeing, Clardy added to and 
modified Gary Shannon's simple game from the red book, 
Dragon Maze. 

Getting the computer is the first step on the road to ruin. A 
crazy idea usually follows two weeks later. 

He thought it would be fun to write his own game. Who 
knows what devils were whispering in Clardy's ear as he 



worked by day and programmed Dungeon Campaign by night. 
They must have been persuasive. 

Bob has a natural gift for programming and Dungeon Cam- 
paign emerged as a pretty entertaining game. 

Sealing his fate, he took the important step of seeking peer 
acceptance. With game in hand, Bob went to a meeting of the 
Apple PugetSound Program Library Exchange. Foolhardy by 
nature, Bob gave away copies of Dungeon Campaign to club 
members and other friends. 

The game was welcomed with crazed celebration by the 
primitive software tribe. Clardy's fans encouraged him to add 
more things to the program and think about marketing it. 

The Call of Babylon. It didn't take much to lead Bob to the 
edge of the fiery chasm. Instead of waiting to be pushed, he 
made it easy on everybody and jumped headfirst. Not a few 
people are glad he did. 

Clardy bought more memory in order to tackle hi-res 
graphics. In December 1978 he started work on Wilderness 
Campaign, which is a top contender for being the first true fan- 
tasy role-playing game for the Apple. Working evenings and 
weekends, Bob finished the game fairly fast and decided to 
market it together with Dungeon Campaign on one disk.

Boeing put Clardy on a swing shift and he spent the day- 
time hours pushing his disk at local computer stores. He got a 
pretty encouraging response. One store in Seattle, Empire 
Electronics, took the disks on consignment, reimbursing 
Clardy for each package as it was sold. 

Seeing dollar signs in their dreams, Bob and Ann seriously 
began to think about starting a full-time software publishing 
house. The time was right. 

Mountains shook and stars exploded in the heavens. Mad- 
ness gripped the Clardys ; Bob quit his job, figuring they had 
three months to make a go of software publishing. If at the end 
of three months they hadn't made it, Bob would just get an- 
other job and forget the whole crazy thing. 

They didn't have to. After three months they had made 
more money than they had expected and Synergistic was here 
to stay. 

Choosing a name is an important part of this racket. It was 
Ann's father who came up with Synergistic. Software com- 
bined with a computer is a synergism — a cooperative action of 
discrete agencies such that the total effect is greater than the 
sum of the effects taken independently. 

In other words, software without a computer is not very 
useful; neither is a computer without software. The two com- 
bined form a powerful tool. 

Starting your own business is not easy. Keeping it going is 
no stroll through the lilies either. Ask any bum on the street 
and he'll tell you how hard it is to get people to give you money. 

Law of Economics. Both the bum and the struggling soft- 
ware publisher could use a million dollars but can survive on 
much less. Needless to say, the software publisher can get 
bummed out easily when there's not enough money to go 
around. Bob decries the lack of proper finances and the subse- 
quent raw look of Synergistic's early advertising, packaging, 
and promotion. 

"In those early days we got a lot of attention, considering 
we had next to no advertising. If we started over again the 
same way today, we'd never make it." 

Ann and Bob know they could have done some things bet- 
ter. Two people alone together scaling an unconquered peak, 
they have done a superlative job, all things considered. 

Bob was and still is a virtuoso programmer, not scared to 
take a chance. He wrote and marketed one of the first utility 
programs for the Apple, Higher Graphics, in November 1979. 

Other than Apple's File Cabinet and a few minor index-card 
programs, there was not much in early 1980 that you could call 
database management software. Clardy saw a fat calf and 
closed in for the kill. 

After he quit his regular job at Boeing, Clardy was asked 
back to write a database program with Christopher Anson, a 
fan of Clardy 's and a clerk in a local stereo store. Anson knew 
very little about programming and databases, but he was a 
good salesman. Clardy and Anson completed the job in short 
order for a fee that, translated into an hourly wage, was dou- 
ble Bob's previous pay rate. 

From this outside contract, Bob got the embryo for a data- 
base program for the Apple. At the time of its release, Modifi- 
able Database was welcomed like Dungeon Campaign had 
been welcomed earlier. It seemed like Clardy could do no 
wrong. 

Tales of the Unexpected. This foray into the world of busi- 
ness software changed the focus of Bob's efforts. He was not 
really prepared for the amount of support that is needed for 
business programs. He agreed to do custom adjustments to 
Modifiable Database for a modest fee. 

The Clardys found themselves on the phone all the time 
striving to provide the best user support possible. Bob's crea- 
tivity slackened and his work on new programs ceased entire- 
ly as he performed hundreds of individual modifications. 

Contrary to what you might think, Clardy didn't have to 
bribe Neil Konzen to write Program Line Editor. A seventeen- 
year-old whiz kid out of Belle vue, Konzen became friends with 
Clardy through the Apple PugetSound club. Konzen wrote Pro- 
gram Line Editor for himself and offered it to Synergistic af- 



ter good response from users. 

Leading the pack once again, Synergistic released Pro- 
gram Line Editor when there were few programming tools for 
the Apple on the market. Universally praised, Program Line 
Editor is being rereleased with a few more enhancements by 
Konzen and a new name, Global Program Line Editor. 

Thoroughly seduced by the praise heaped on his programs 
and newly inspired after the Fifth Annual West Coast Comput- 
er Faire, Clardy began work on his greatest opus to date. 

A dungeon master in college, Bob often borrows from 
his extensive knowledge of fantasy role-playing games. He 
brought to Odyssey a whole range of experience that makes it 
a grand adventure with something for everyone. 

Bob's goal with Odyssey was to create a multigame game. 
Packing the disk so full he had to dump DOS, Clardy made 
Odyssey very complete. But if Bob thought he was being fa- 
natic about the complexity, he was wrong. Or, more accurate- 
ly, he wasn't fanatic enough. 

The game required you to gather fighters, bearers, and 
mules, arm the first and feed all, and collect multifarious para-

phernalia for your odyssey. Due to the memory limitations of 
Integer Basic, if you accumulated more than 32,767 units of 
weight, the program crashed. 

Ann and Bob kept getting angry calls from hard-core 
gamers who had built up miniature armies of 150 men (it takes 
much fewer to get off the island) . Bob saw the light and re- 
wrote Odyssey in Applesoft, but the new version was a long 
time coming. 

Farewell My Lovely. Bob was one of the last programmers 
to give up Integer Basic for Applesoft. He still likes the older 
language and wishes more programmers would use it. 

Clardy feels that Integer has most of what you need to pro- 
gram games in general and it is faster. It is simple and easy to 
use. True to his convictions, Bob is currently releasing an Inte- 
ger Basic compiler authored by Chris Galfo. 

Along with the bigger products, Synergistic has put out a 
steady stream of lesser packages, some of which are, nonethe- 
less, quite good. 

Bob and Ann tried the education market several times with 
programs like The Linguist and The Star Gazer's Guide. The 
programs never sold well and, according to Bob, it is the same 
old story with many schools, whose budgets allow for comput- 
ers and hardware, but not for software. 

Clardy feels that many learning institutions are doing a dis- 
service to the industry that provides them with educational 
software by devaluating that software through copying. 

Some saps never learn. Clardy is taking the uncertain 
plunge into education again this month, releasing The Com- 
municator, a keyboard-oriented speed typing and reading 
program. 

1981 proved to be a year of changes at Synergistic. Odyssey 
was out on the market and raking in the bucks It was time to 
get more professional. 

Synergistic hired its first full-time employee, programmer 
analyst Mike Branham, in March. They moved the business

out of Bob and Ann's basement into office space, and they 
hired Will Clardy, Bob's younger brother, late in the year to 
handle marketing and advertising. 

The failure of Data Reporter, an updated version of Modifi- 
able Database, to compete favorably against such packages as 
DB Master and Personal Filing System was blamed on the ad- 
vertising and marketing. 

Look, Up in the Sky! It was clear that something had to be 
done and Bob turned to his younger brother Will, whose back- 
ground, among other things, is in marketing. 

Will has owned three different planes and is in love with fly- 
ing. His first career was as a pilot for a major airline, Texas In- 
ternational. Imperfect eyes made him give up the profession. 

If you can't be a pilot, then why not the next best thing? Will 
was a prime dispatcher with the FAA until 1979 when he quit. 

Will has done many different things, from designing and in- 
stalling an Apple-controlled sign system for airports to spend- 
ing a year hand-delivering Odyssey in his spare time to every 
computer store he could find in the state of Texas. "Almost 
everyone bought it." 

Big Will's presence has already made a difference at Syner- 
gistic. Their advertising has never looked better; Data Re- 
porter's new campaign is just now hitting the publications. 
Consistency is the name of the game and Will is determined to 
make the advertising and packaging consistent with the quali- 
ty of the programs. 

Synergistic was one of the last companies to start using 
copy protection and Bob still feels strongly about the subject of 
piracy. 

"I believe any attempt at copy protection is a waste of time. 
It takes a thousand programming hours that the user has to 
pay for but never sees on the screen." 

Bob feels that a good back-up policy is the best way to com- 
bat most piracy: Quick and cheap replacement. Utilities and 
some business programs should never be protected because 
the user has to modify them. But often practical military 
necessity, in the guise of business practice, warrants stiffer 
measures. 

Synergistic is currently in the process of acquiring a pro- 
tection scheme that defeats nibble copiers. Clardy hopes that 
in the future there won't be a need to protect programs ; at the 
moment, he is determined not to lose as much money as he 
feels he has lost in the past. 

At the beginning of 1982, Synergistic continued the upward 
climb and moved into new quarters. They now occupy most of 
the top floor of a building in Renton, a curious town nestled in 
the foothills about thirty minutes from downtown Seattle. A 
river originating at Mount Rainier flows past the Synergistic 
building. 

The Starting Lineup. Synergistic's staff has swelled to ten 
and includes some pretty sharp individuals. 

Mike Branham worked in a Byte Shop and has done part- 
time programming for Synergistic several times. He helped 
Bob do customizing of Modifiable Database and was involved 
in writing portions of Data Reporter. Now he's Synergistic's 
database expert and he's in charge of software services and 
support. 

David Kampschafer is a programmer who has worked on 

Synergistic's Planetary Guide and two new products, G.A.P. 
and The Communicator. 

Ron Aldrich was fifteen when he began programming pro- 
fessionally for an insurance company. Since then he has pro- 
duced for Synergistic Higher Text and Higher Text II. Escape 
from Arcturus was Aldrich's first game for Synergistic, and he 
has returned with Nightmare Gallery. Hired on full-time in 
April 1981, Aldrich has done numerous machine language pro- 
gramming tasks for a score of Synergistic products. 

Ann, in addition to the accounting, is responsible for QC — 
an old Boeing term meaning quality control. After a game has 
supposedly been thoroughly tested, it is given to Ann; she has a 
unique talent for finding bugs. This usually means picking the 
right place to type in the wrong thing. Bob calls her "a terrific 
user." 



Will's wife Becky joined the company a couple of months 
ago and has taken on the job of production coordinator. 

Another important member of the Synergistic staff, though 
he doesn't work in Renton, is Ann's brother David Dickens. Sit- 
uated in Salem, Oregon, Dickens has programmed much of 
Synergistic's inhouse software. 

Rounding out the staff is Lloyd Oilman Jr., Synergistic's 
Atari programmer; Leslie Hornung, public relations and docu- 
mentation writing; and Jill Jansson, who is the secretary-re- 
ceptionist. 

These gullible chumps should have their hands full right 
about now. Synergistic is releasing a barrelful of new prod- 
ucts including four new games, two business programs, four 
utilities, and one educational program. 

Adventure to Atlantis is the long-awaited sequel to Odyssey 
and, from all indications, fans of the first game will not be dis- 
appointed. Playable with a joystick, Atlantis has sections that 
involve real-time action, improving on the old-style fantasy 
games. Clardy is not the first programmer to attempt a real- 
time adventure, but his particular style and flair make At- 
lantis a welcome addition to the genre. 

Nightmare Gallery is a home-arcade game written by Ron 
Aldrich from an idea by Bob. Glen Bredon, the prolific author 
of Southwestern Data Systems's assembler, Merlin, took a hand 
at 3-D graphics in the home-arcade game, Procyon Warrior. 
Charles Fleishman is a lawyer who worked on The Linguist 
way back when and now has returned with the strategy ar- 
cade game, U-Boat Command. 

For business, Synergistic is releasing Inventory Manager, 
written by Joe Marinello, who is, among other things, a Bud- 
dhist monk. Bob Huelsdonk, an engineer for Honeywell and a 
big fan of the Apple III, has authored Word Weaver III — a 
word processor for the Apple III. 

Another new utility package from Synergistic is Soft Sev- 
enty, a program that gives you seventy columns across the 
screen without hardware. G.A.P. is short for Game 
Animation Package, written by Glen Bredon, David Kamp- 
shaffer, and another lawyer/programmer in Synergistic's 
fold, John Conley. 

What was once a two-person company working out of a 
basement is now a full-fledged software publishing house. Ann 
and Bob Clardy have really earned the name Synergistic. Be- 
fore, taken separately, Ann was just another accountant and 
Bob was just another electrical engineer. Working together 
they have become much, much more. 

Clardy commented in Softalk's prediction story (Decem- 
ber 1981) on advanced technology and its possible effect on 
third world countries. He believes that if underdeveloped coun- 
tries can acquire advanced technology it will increase the 
chances for world peace. 

It is indicative of Clardy's depth that he felt impelled to ad- 
dress a problem that is far removed from creating games in 
the small town of Renton, Washington. Yet Clardy is aware 
that he and his business affect the real world, just as much as 
the real world affects his life and livelihood. 

Switch Hitters. Synergistic Software and its wide range of 
products 'is a model for the ideal mix of the escapist and the 
practical. Clardy could have made a lot more money just writ- 
ing games, instead of publishing unprotected products like 
Program Line Editor. Some might call this bad business sense. 
Others will note that Clardy is concerned with helping people 
and through this making the world a better place. 

Ripped off, praised, criticized, loved, and ignored, Bob and 
Ann Clardy have seen it all. They have gone through the great 
flame of capitalism unscathed up to this point. There are those 
who cannot make the same claim. 

Entering an important phase in its development, Syner- 
gistic Software has the leadership and personnel to compete 
with newer companies that are starting with much greater re- 
sources than those with which the Clardys began. 

It's a different ball game now, but the Clardys are deter- 
mined to get the hits and make the right pitches. All they ask 
for is a winning season and a chance at the playoffs. Dl

Introducing the New Personal 
Computer Plotter from 
Hewlett-Packard 

Now you can use your Apple® com- 
puter to generate your own presentation 
charts, graphs, and pie charts. How? 
Simply add on the new high 
quality, low cost HP 7470A 
Personal Computer 
Plotter. \ 

The 7470A helps you 
save time, save money, and, 
lets you communicate quickly, accu 
rately and effectively. 

The eye is faster. 

Data, when visualized graphically, becomes informa- 
tion fast. Charts and bar graphs can make any presenta- 
tion clearer and more readily understood. But asking your 
staff to produce the graphics 
for your next presentation 
doesn't ensure accuracy or 
artistic talent. And going to 
outside suppliers can be 
costly. Combined with your 
Apple® computer, the new 
HP 7470A plotter does the 
communicating for you. 
Quickly. Logically. And with 
off-the-shelf software. 

Fast and pretty. 

The 7470A gives you high plotting speed with excellent 
line quality. . .faster than any competitive small plotter. 
On top of all that, it comes in an attractive design 
package that looks nice on your desk. And it does it 
for only $1,550. (U.S.A. domestic suggested retail price.) 




Count on it. 

The 7470A is built the Hewlett- 
Packard way. To last. Designed and 
engineered with only a few parts, none 
of which require adjustment. And with 
customized integrated circuits 
that ensure reliability. 




Pen Pals. 

The HP 7470A has 
two single-pen stables 
that output multi-color plots in 
your choice of ten coordinated colors. Pens 
are automatically capped and stored. 

An option youH want, too. 

For only $95, you can also get a 17057 Overhead 
Transparency Kit that turns your plots into transpar- 
encies for overhead projectors. For "I need it tomorrow 
at 9:00 A.M!" meetings, it's a necessity. 

Start plotting your next presentation today. 
Clip and mail the coupon below. Now.

THE PAS 



ATH 



Tools of the Craft, Part 11 

Character Input from the Keyboard. Getting an individual 
character from the keyboard is as simple as issuing a call to 
Read and naming a Char variable as the parameter. Suppose 
that a variable Ch is declared as being of type Char. Then, 
Read(Ch) causes Pascal to accept exactly one character from 
the keyboard; Pascal will wait as long as necessary for the 
user to press a key, then will put the character value asso- 
ciated with that key into Ch. Here is a program that echoes the 
ASCII value of every character you type at the keyboard: 

PROGRAM 
EchoASCII; 
CONST 
Blank = 

QuitChar= *(§;,'; 
VAR 
CH 
:Char; 
BEGIN (* EchoASCII *) 
REPEAT 
Read(Ch); 

WriteLn(Blank, Ord(Ch)); 
UNTIL (Ch = QuitChar); 
END (* EchoASCII *). 

Notice that you may exit the program and regain the Pas- 
cal system main prompt line by pressing the at-sign (@) key 
(shift-P on the Apple II keyboard). Now compile and execute 
EchoASCII. Press a few keys and see what happens. Here's a 
sample run:

If you play around with EchoASCII long enough, you may 
memorize several of the ASCII codes; in fact, should you ever 
need to drill yourself in ASCII, this program will come in 
handy. However, the reason for its appearance here is that it's 
a very good tool for illustrating several aspects of Apple Pas- 
cal's input mechanism. Keep this program around; we will 
need to use it from time to time as we venture farther down the 
Path. It will help us draw conceptual maps of some hitherto un- 
charted regions of Apple Pascal. For now, let's do some ex- 
periments. 

While EchoASCII is running, press the space bar. Make 
note of the response. Now press the return key. Because the 
number 32 is reported in either case, you can see that both 
characters appear as blanks to Pascal, even though the true 
ASCII code for return — the code that is actually generated by 
the keyboard — is 13. As we saw last time, Pascal normally sees 
a blank whenever it comes to the end of a line of characters, 
and return is taken as signaling end-of-line from the console 
keyboard. 

Now press control-C. Again, you see 32, and this verifies the 
claim made last month that control-C is also translated into a 
blank by Pascal. Of course, the computer keyboard actually 
generates the ASCII code 3 when you press control-C. It is the 
Pascal system that maps the original character, which it per- 



By Jim Merritt 



ceives as an end-of-file marker, into a blank. 

We Digress To Solve a Mystery. Take a good look at the 
EchoASCII program. It includes explicit instructions for put- 
ting onto the console screen the ASCII value of any character 
you type at the console keyboard. But when the program is 
run, what do you actually see on the screen? Not only do you 
receive the ASCII value of the typed character, but you also 
get the character itself. To all appearances, there's no instruc- 
tion in EchoASCII that generates this extra output. The Pas- 
cal system itself is responsible for echoing the original charac- 
ter, and it does this even before passing the character along to 
the EchoASCII program. 

Here is the sequence of events that takes place when you 
Read from the console: 

1. Your program tells Apple Pascal that it wants a charac- 
ter; the system takes over and waits to receive a character. 

2. You press a key. 

3. The keyboard generates an ASCII code corresponding to 
the pressed key. 

4. A small machine language program (the keyboard 
driver), embedded with the p-machine, receives the ASCII 
code, intercepting control-A (flip screen), control-S (stop dis- 
play), control-F (flush display), and certain other control 
codes (for a complete listing and explanation, see the operat- 
ing system manual) . Under normal circumstances, a Pascal 
program can never receive these special codes, since the 
driver uses and discards them. 

5. The driver sends ASCII codes that it does not intercept to 
the Pascal operating system. Before doing anything else, the 
operating system sends a copy of the code it receives back to 
the screen driver (another Apple machine language program 
within the p-machine) for immediate display on the console 
screen. Note that the return code is echoed as a return-line- 
feed couplet. In other words, two separate characters are sent 
to the screen driver for every press of the return key: CR (car- 
riage return, code 13) , which returns the cursor to the leftmost 
side of the current display line, and LF (linefeed, code 10), 
which moves the cursor down to the next display line without 
moving it horizontally. This accounts for the superfluous blank 
line that appears on the screen when you press return during 
the execution of EchoASCII. 

6. The operating system translates return (control-M) , con- 
trol-C, and control-P into blanks. (Control-P translation isn't as

simple as implied by that statement ; more to come on this sub- 
ject later.) 

7. The final character, after operating system translation, 
is sent to the user program for final disposition. 

Special Functions: EOF and EOLn. Even though Pascal 
translates return and control-C into blanks, it does give you 
and your program a way to distinguish between regular 
blanks, blanks that started out as control-C codes, and blanks 
that were originally return codes. The built-in Boolean func- 
tion EOLn (End Of Lane) will always be True immediately af- 
ter the Pascal system receives a return code from the con- 
sole; the built-in function EOF (End Of File) will always be 
True just after the system receives a control-C. 

With slight modification, EchoASCII can not only help you 
become familiar with the ASCII character set, but can also 
demonstrate the behavior of EOF and EOLn. To extend Echo- 
ASCII so that it reports when EOF or EOLn is True, just sub- 
stitute the following statement block for the one in the original 
version : 

BEGIN (* EchoASCII— version 2 *) 
REPEAT 
Read(Ch); 

Write(Blank, Ord(Ch)); 
IF EOLn 
THEN 

Write ('EOLn'); 
IF EOF 
THEN 

Write ('EOF'); 
WriteLn; 
UNTIL (Ch = QuitChar); 
END (* EchoASCII *). 

Compile and execute EchoASCII, version 2, and notice 
what happens whenever you press the return key or control-C. 
After the 32 that corresponds to return, you will see the legend 
"EOLn." Since the legend is not displayed for previous or suc- 
ceeding characters, this means that EOLn is True immediate- 
ly after someone presses the return key but reverts to False 
when the next key is pressed (unless, of course, the next key 
pressed is also return). When you press control-C, the pro- 
gram displays both "EOF" and "EOLn." This is because, in 
Pascal, the end of file — the logical end of information — also im- 
plies end of line. 

EOF and EOLn are convenient built-in signals that your 
program may either observe or ignore. They represent the 
Pascal system's best guess as to whether the end of informa- 
tion or the end of an input line has been reached. In the vast 
majority of cases, as we'll see, this guess corresponds to physi- 
cal truth. But there are exceptions, especially with regard to 
console input. For example, even after control-C has been 
pressed and EOF becomes True, a program may still issue 
calls to Read and acquire more characters from the key- 
board. You can see this for yourself, while executing Echo- 
ASCII, by continuing to type after pressing control-C. The pro- 
gram continues to display the ASCII code for each character 
that you type. 

Notice, however, that once you press control-C, the "EOF" 
legend is displayed for every succeeding character. Once EOF 
is turned on, you cannot turn it off as you can EOLn, simply by 
reading more characters. To restore a value of False to EOF, 
you must use the built-in procedure Reset, which we'll study 
soon. 

That input data can still be collected from the keyboard af- 
ter EOF becomes True is a convenient idiosyncrasy of the Ap- 
ple Pascal system. We are lucky that EchoASCII does not have 
to observe EOF or EOLn ; this fact permitted us to write a sim- 
ple program and experiment with it, before proceeding to ex- 
amine two new built-in functions. Next month, you'll see how 
Read and ReadLn may be used to acquire data from sources 
other than the keyboard. EOF (and frequently EOLn) will also 
work for these alternative input sources. However, for nearly 
all of them, EOF means just what its name implies— the end of 



all available data. In these cases, you're wise to heed EOF's 
warning and abandon attempts to acquire input from that 
source. Before writing programs that deliberately ignore EOF 
and EOLn, you need to become much more familiar with the 
behavior of the Pascal system than you are now. Until you 
have a good working knowledge of the system, you can't, with 
any certainty, say whether Read or ReadLn will continue to 
work in a given situation, with a given input source, after EOF 
or EOLn becomes True. 

Another Tool. Many of the programs we will develop along 
the Path will require the user to supply one or more yes or no 
answers in order to direct (or alter) program behavior. For ex- 
ample, perhaps a program is about to undertake a particular- 
ly sensitive operation, such as eliminating an important data 
file from the disk. In situations like this, a good program us- 
ually asks the user to confirm the desirability of the operation. 
Since we will be needing yes/no confirmation often, it makes 
sense to develop a tool that performs the task for us and that 
we can use in our programs as often as necessary, without hav- 
ing to write it from scratch each time. 

Let's first decide how the tool should behave. It should wait 
for the user to type in a reply that signifies yes or no and re- 
turn an appropriate representation of the user's response. 
Ideally it should let the user type a simple Y or N to indicate 
yes or no, respectively. In addition, the tool should be smart 
enough to recognize the capital and lower-case versions of 
these letters as being equivalent. 

A lot of people are used to pressing the return key to skip 
past uninteresting or irrelevant questions ; this generally cor- 
responds to an answer of no, and our tool should respect this in- 
terpretation of return. However, what if the user presses a key 
other than Y, N, or return? Should this also be taken as a no an- 
swer, or as any answer at all? Probably not. Typographical er- 
rors are far too easily made, especially by people who have 
limited experience with keyboards or computers. Consequent-

A game without rules. A prison without bars. The Prisoner is 
perhaps the toughest adventure game ever written for the Apple 
computer. 

As you peel back layer after layer of riddle, deception, and 
doublespeak, you suddenly realize that your computer is 
playing games with YOU. Escape takes more than just a boat, a

Yes := False; 

END; 

END (* CASE Ch *) 

WriteLn; 

END (* Yes *); 

Yes waits for the user to respond with Y, N, or end of line 
(return) . If the response is Y, Yes adds the letters es to the dis- 
play to complete the word Yes. If the response is N, the letter o 
is added to round out No. Yes displays the entire word No when 
the user responds with return. All other responses are ig- 
nored. Yes calls upon the function Capital, which we de- 
veloped in a previous column, to coerce all alphabetic re- 
sponse to upper case. It also issues a WriteLn after a valid re- 
sponse, to help it stand out from other information on the 
screen. For a Y response, Yes's Boolean function value be- 
comes True. For N or return, the value becomes False. 

The following illustrates how Yes might be used in an Ap- 
ple Pascal program: 

WritefDoes this please you, Master? '); 
IF Yes 
THEN 

WriteLnfThank you, kind sir!') 
ELSE 

WriteLnfA thousand pardons, venerable one!') 

You should always issue some type of prompt, prior to 
using Yes, that indicates what question is being asked. Other- 
wise the computer will appear to freeze during the call to Yes, 
and the user will probably have no idea of how to deal with the 
situation. 

Exercises. Here are a couple of projects to keep you busy 
until next month, when solutions to the problems they pose will 
appear in the Pascal Path. 

1. Easy for old-timers. The function Capital in Yes was 
used to illustrate a point: If we have good tools to use, we can 
build upon them in creating other tools. What if you didn't have 
a Capital function? How would you write Yes so that it could ig- 
nore differences between upper and lower-case responses? 

2. Easy if you've paid attention this month. Modify Echo- 
ASCII to quit, not on receipt of an at-sign, but whenever the 
user presses control-C. 

3. Tough! Write a program that includes and uses the Yes 
function in an interactive dialogue, where the computer tries to 
guess an integer number that the user has in mind. Here is a 
sample of such a dialogue: 



IS THE NUMBER LESS THAN 20? Yes 
IS THE NUMBER LESS THAN 10? No 
IS THE NUMBER LESS THAN 15? No 
IS THE NUMBER LESS THAN 18? Yes 
IS THE NUMBER LESS THAN 16? No 
IS THE NUMBER LESS THAN 17? Yes 
IS THE NUMBER 16? Yes 
I KNEW IT! 

WANT TO PLAY AGAIN? No 

You are free to use this sample dialogue as a pattern or ig- 
nore it, as you wish. Let the user's number range from 0 to 20. 
When you have a working program, how would you change it 
so that the user's number could range from 0 to 32767? (Lame 
hint : In the most efficient general solution to this problem, you 
need only change the value of a single constant to extend the 
range of numbers. But beware! This is also true of one of the 
least efficient solutions, in which the program counts up or 
down, one number at a time, until it stumbles upon the user's 
number.) 

Remember to include the Capital function in your declara- 
tion area prior to the declaration of Yes, or you will receive a 
syntax error. If you don't have a copy of Capital handy, you 
may need to make use of the solution to exercise 1. 

How does your program deal, if at all, with a user who lies 
about her secret number? 



The Saga of Barry: Monday. . . 

You printed a letter of mine several 
months ago. In it, I asked a few ques- 
tions and made a few remarks. I con- 
sider the response amazing. 

Soon after publication I received sev- 
eral long-distance phone calls giving me 
helpful advice and encouragement. This 
proves to me that Softalk has a wide and 
motivated readership. If there is one 
word I would use to describe us, it would 
be intense. 

One person recommended a piece of 
software (I bought it) , one person recom- 
mended a club (I joined it), one person 
gave advice (I took it), and one person 
(Mr. Trahan) wrote in to you with a re- 
ply (you printed it) . That person gave me 
some addresses to write to (I have) for 
information concerning low-cost voice 
recognition cards for the Apple. 

While I'm here, I'd like to voice some 
more opinions, if I may. 

That hot tub ad is certainly sexist. It is 
very, very sexist to make that man stand 
there fully clothed in a tub full of naked 
women while he focuses on a point 2,000 
miles dead ahead. 

Type'n'Talk works; that is, I typed in 
some questions and asked my wife to 
stand next to the speaker and listen. The 
questions were typed in, I hit return, the 
speaker spoke, my wife heard the com- 
puter speech for the first time, and it was 
comprehensible enough for her to an- 
swer the questions. 

I've had long discussions with friends 
who are so close to buying a computer 
but are thinking of alternatives to an Ap- 
ple. It is very hard to sway people away 
from the IBM and the Osborne. One looks 
great and the other is cheap (I forget 
which is which). My best shot was the 
true example of the walls of a large 
downtown computer store in San Fran- 
cisco. Each wall has software for a cer- 
tain type computer. One wall had Atari, 
TRS-80, Osborne, and PET. One wall was 
IBM but half of the slots were Apple. Of 
course, the other two walls were filled 
with Apple software. 

We loyal Apple users must persuade 
our friends to stay with Apple. It will help 
both of us. 

Have you ever seen a Venus 's-flytrap 
with one of its trap-petals clamped onto 
one of its stalks? Probably not, but it 
looks as if it is eating itself; it won't, it re- 
leases itself after an hour or so. The point 
is: Locksmith can copy itself, and has. 
Which brings me to copying. 

Piracy is a biased word; it implies 
theft. As they say, it all depends which ox 
is being gored. Mine is my wallet, so my 
policy on copying is this : If I can get it, I 
will. 

It's a business to them, right? They 
will charge as much as the traffic will 
bear. Too bad for them that their prod- 
uct can be easily duplicated ; it goes with 



D IS ( U 



the territory. Too bad for us that it takes 
thousand dollar machines to run the 
product. 

There are some original ideas in this 
letter; they are encoded on my disks. I 
forbid anyone (except Softalk) from put- 
ting alphabet letters into a sequence to 
form words to form paragraphs which 
look substantially like this letter. See how 
absurd these protecting and monopoliz- 
ing ideas can be? 

Copy protection is an indefensible, 
self-defeating, technically impossible, 
unenforceable, greedy policy. So do the 
American Thing! Lower the price, in- 
crease volume. I would love to buy a 
Strategic Simulations game, but for sixty 
bucks? I would buy six for sixty dollars, 
but not one. 

There appears to be a need, soon, for 
an, "Apple Modification Shop." This 
would be a shop where owners could 
bring their machines to have all the 
modifications done to them such as new 
keyboard installed, cards that require 
cutting wires installed, fans installed, 
outside joystick connection, big memory 
installed, etc., etc. Does anybody do that 
now?

. . .Friday 

This letter is an addendum to my letter of 
22 March 1982. I said something in that 
letter about copying and now find myself 
caught up in this moral morass. 

I said about programs, "If I can get it, 
I will." That sounds bad but I have found 
a new rationalization that eases the guilt. 
Here it is. 

One of my friends was very, very 
close to buying an Osborne. When I told 
him that I would give him copies of some 
basic programs if he buys an Apple, he 
changed his mind. When he gets his sys- 
tem up and running, I will ask him to 
write to you explaining why he bought the 
Apple. 

Of course, he will now be buying other 
Apple software for his machine. The au- 
thors of those earlier transferred pro- 
grams can take solace that they died so 
that others may live. 

The answer to one problem is to in- 
clude in ROM, or on internal chips, the 
four basic programs every microcom- 
puter should have: 

1. Word processing. 

2. Database management. 

3. Electronic spreadsheet. 



O P E II 

S S I O H 

4. Role-playing game. 

It costs hundreds of thousands of dol- 
lars to produce a $10 record album. A 
$200,000 program will retail for $60. How 
much did aural records cost when there 
were only a million phonographs around? 
If the early aural records cost the same, 
relative to time and inflation, I will con- 
cede a point to the software publishers. 

The whole point, of course, is the pro- 
ducer trying to control a product for as 
long as possible to milk the most profit 
out of it. I don't blame them; that's what 
good businessmen do. Apple did it when 
they excluded mail order sales. Soon it 
may be such that only college graduates 
may purchase computers — after a writ- 
ten test — and a recommendation — and an 
interview — etc. 

Imagine selling an aural record and 
saying only one member of the family 
can listen to that particular record on 
Sundays only. That rule would require 
many more records to be sold if the 
whole family wants to hear it every day 
of the week. 

The software contract that stipulates 
that the buyer can't copy is a nice try to 
control, but it just makes criminals out of 
us. Once the product is sold (not leased or 
rented) the product must be allowed to be 
used as the buyer sees fit; that is, resold, 
copied, or used as a frisbee. 

When I give my dollars for a pro- 
gram, maybe I should stipulate to the 
software company that the dollars must 
not be used for lawyers' fees. I gave them 
a product which took time and money to 
produce — dollar bills — now I will control 
and limit how they use my product. (And 
no dollar bill paper airplanes either!) 
The rebuttal to that is dollar bills can't be 
copied, right? Right! Dollar bills can't be 
copied and that's the only thing that can't 
be copied. 

I would hope in a few years that this 
whole question will appear quaint and 
dated.

Honesty Is Not Gray 

Your March Open Discussion featured 
two more contributors to the subject of 
software piracy. One declared con- 
sistent exercise of a verifiable ethical 
principle to be unacceptable ; the other 
declared ethical principles to be unac- 
ceptable, period. Your succinct January 
appraisal of piracy as theft was charac- 
terized as "hypocritical" and "false mo- 



52 

rality." You artfully refrained from 
further comment. Move over. It's my 
turn. 

When one addresses an ethical issue, 
one owes, as a minimal courtesy to the 
audience, the presence of mind to name 
the ethical principle being invoked. Any 
discussion of "ethics" implies, and re- 
quires, a clearly defined mutual ethical 
standard. It cannot be resolved by refer- 
ence to peer pressure, personal whims, 
or private opinion polls. 

My dictionary defines the verb pirate 
as: "to appropriate and reproduce (a 
book, invention, etc.) without authoriza- 
tion or legal right." It defines defraud 
as: "to deprive of a right or property by 
fraud; cheat." If theft isn't a moral is- 
sue, nothing is. 

No reader would try to program the 
6502 microprocessor with "maybe/may- 
be not" bits and random "don't- be-too- 
consistent" bits. It doesn't work that 
way; neither does the human mind. That 
is the mental equivalent of dividing by 
zero; the joker, the wild card. 

This letter is really addressed to those 
who resolved the issue of theft at the age 
of nine or so, and don't steal, but aren't 
fully prepared to say why. 

There aren't "two sides" to software 
piracy. Sale of software is a trade; i.e., a 
mutual (voluntary) exchange of values, 
and as such requires the full understand- 
ing and consent of both parties. Any at- 
tempt to obtain value from another with- 
out this consent requires an "involun- 
tary trade"; i.e., force or fraud is in- 
volved. 

Once one claims a "right" to the theft 
of another's ideas, one might as well go 
for his property too, and even his life/ if 
he tries to prevent this. There are no prin- 
ciples by which one can claim that soft- 
ware piracy is sometimes justifiable, but 
that theft of one's own personal comput- 
er never is. 

One cult figure in the vanguard of the 
sixties' movements understood this the 
best of them all: "We got a right to any- 
thing we can take." (Huey P. Newton, 
circa 1964). He had little truck with the 
whining you-don 't-have-to-be-too-consis- 
tent, intellectual types. He didn't have 
to justify nothin'; everybody just sort of 
understood, and that was, as the man 
says, that. 

So much for division by zero: those 
who repudiate the "acceptability" of in- 
dependent and self-sustaining action are 
physically dependent upon those who 
don't. They shouldn't count on their vic- 
tim's sanction. They need the victim 
more than he needs them, and, unless he 
doesn't understand what he hears, he'll 
know this first. 

I don't think most readers steal, or 
need to. I don't think views that theft is 
okay in a "good" cause, or that discus- 
sion of same is hypocritical, are a credi- 
ble part of this controversy. I think these 
view3 are the cause of it.

software to us will ultimately end either 
in industrywide return to this practice or 
in Penguin going belly-up. The outcome 
depends upon us. 

Most of us will respect authors' rights, 
as we do our own. How? Don't be a sec- 
ond-hander. Decide for yourself. Act ac- 
cordingly. Don't pay lip service to a dou- 
ble standard you don't personally re- 
spect; speak out, or act against it, when 
you can. One doesn't arbitrate with 
takers or providers of "hot" merchan- 
dise. 

Your own self-interest is at stake. 
Your highest ethical standard is your 
own life, and your mind is your only 
means of living it. What you make of all 
this is your own business, but your choice 
is between this standard, or Newton's.

Reader Response 

Since you asked for my comments, I will 
grant your wish. 

I feel any advertising is permissible 
and that no advertising is obscene. 

I like your product reviews and com- 
parisons the most . . . and feel that more 
pages should be devoted to this. 

I feel that articles explaining pro- 
grams need to be somewhat more de- 
tailed and self-explanatory with ex- 
amples. 

I strongly recommend binding the 
cover more securely. Mine is forever 
coming off of each issue. This is very an- 
noying. 

Please don't separate stories and 
break them up as much as you have been 
doing. 

Please try to improve the paper qual- 
ity and print size since you are now up- 
grading to charged subscriptions. 

Overall I feel you have an excellent 
magazine and am satisfied with your fair 
subscription price of $18. 

I feel that more program submis- 
sions and utilities would enhance the 
magazine tremendously.

Sticking Your NEC Out 
My system is: Apple II Plus, 48K, two 
drives, keypad, Model 5515 NEC Spin- 
writer Printer interfaced with Apple 
high-speed serial board. 

My problem: Although I have talked 
by phone to Mike Morn at the NEC place 
in Lexington, Massachusetts and called 
for Henry Hamstra at the Atlanta office 
several times, being told that he would 
call me, I still can't learn how to cause 
the 5515 to print bidirectionally. 

This printer is called Diablo-compati- 
ble and a graphics program written for 
the 1660 Diablo works. It will print bidi- 
rectionally when running Supertext III so 
the printer and interface are okay, but 
with present-day write-protected pro- 
grams I am unable to determine what 
characters are being sent to the printer. 

I know of at least two others who have 
the same problem. Although it is a fine 
machine and has given no trouble for 



fifteen months handling constant real 
estate appraisal printing, someone 
should tell NEC that we Apple owners 
would like to print backward as well as 
forward. How about it? Anybody know?

Tolerance 

First, I'd like you to know I'm a novice to 
computing. Second, any criticism is 
meant to be constructive and not to be 
taken personally. Just so that you know 
what kind of person you are dealing with, 
I am a retired auditor (head down, pen- 
cil-moving, persnickety type). Since the 
purchase of my Apple last May I have 
gotten less tolerant of errors, especially 
? syntax errors. The problem is errors in 
your January column, "Debut: All About 
Applesoft." 

Number 1: Page 66, paragraph 2: 
"There is a list of reserved words in Ap- 
pendix C of the Applesoft manual." 
Which manual are you referring to? I 
have four manuals: 

1. The Applesoft Tutorial #030-0044-C 
(Appendix C refers to editing fea- 
tures.) 

2. Applesoft II, #030-0013-E, Basic 
Programming Reference Manual 
(Appendix C refers to error mes- 
sages.) 

3. Apple II Reference Manual, #030- 
0004-C 

(Appendix C refers to ROM list- 
ings.) 

4. Apple II Basic Programming 
Manual #A2L005X 
(Appendices are not lettered.) 

Number 2: Page 66, end of column 1: 
"Type run and presto!" ? Syntax error in 
20. The Apple doesn't like INTRO$, a per- 
fect example of the previous syntax er- 
ror that you pointed out on page 66, col- 
umn, paragraph 1. (I got the program to 
run by changing INTRO$ to RO$.) 

Number 3: Page 66, column 2: the 
first program listing 20 PRINT "THE 
NUMBER I AM THINKING OF 
IS"NUMBER%. When I ran it I got 
"THE NUMBER I AM THINKING OF 
IS3." I corrected this by putting a space 
between " and N. 

I really enjoy your column. It's the 
best explanation of Applesoft that I've 
yet come across — including the Apple- 
soft Tutorial. I hope you take my com- 
ments in the spirit that they're meant, as 
one Apple enthusiast to another. 
Richard Sousa, Oceanside, CA 

Do we get a gold star for noticing that 
only the second book on your list is an 
"Applesoft" "Manual"? 

Number S will work if you put the 
space between "is" and the end quota- 
tion mark of the print statement.

SOFTREK 






There is a newly opened continent, its shores barely 
charted. No one has yet plumbed its depth or conceived its 
breadth. 

For years the borders of this continent were guarded by 
priests and priestesses chanting strange formulas. For years 
the costs of exploring its vastnesses were out of the reach of all 
but a few who could afford large hulks named IBM, CDC, Sper- 
ry-Univac, and others. 

Now that has changed. Small, speedy clippers named Ap- 
ple are afloat, their banners flashing in the sun. 

Pioneers manning them already explore along the more ac- 
cessible rivers and streams. Many have begun to mine the top 
layers of riches. Even so, the continent lies waiting for those 
who will dare to test themselves, their knowledge, and their 
skills. 

Of the sturdy souls left behind, many toil at jobs that, at 
worst, they hate, at best, they enjoy somewhat. They're given 
directions, orders, instructions, memoranda but, even as they 
obey, most dream of command. 

The dream is common to many people: "I want to be in 
command of my own destiny. " For more and more of these 
dreamers, exploring the frontiers of software aboard an Apple 
appears to be a prime way to reach that goal. 

Travel Plans. If you have a head for business, you might 
want to make your way alone, producing and marketing your 
own programs and building a software publishing company. 
That's how On-Line Systems began, and Synergistic Software, 
Muse, Southwestern Data, Turnkey, Horizon, CE Software, 
BPI, Cavalier, Broderbund, and Penguin. 

You may prefer to leave the driving to others, finding es- 
tablished publishers to market your creations. Paul Lutus pro- 
grams in an Oregon log cabin; he has to carry buckets to a 
stream for water, but there's plenty of power for his Apple. He 
leaves production to Apple (Apple Writer), United Software of 
America (Apple World), and Insoft. Tony Suzuki, Chris 



Jochumson, Steve Baker, and Mark Turmell also work this 
way. Bill Budge and Nasir Gebelli used to, with California 
Pacific and Sirius respectively; those two have turned entre- 
preneur since achieving success, with BudgeCo and Gebelli 
Software. 

Whether a software package begins with a programmer in 
a log cabin, arriving at a publisher in a relatively finished 
state; grows from a seed in the publisher's mind; or follows 
some combination of paths, the road to the retail store is long 
and demanding. To show you how it works, we'll journey with 
some programs from idea to publication— take a softrek, if you 
will. We'll become a little bird on Doug Carlston's shoulder to 
track the development of Track Attack; then we'll fly to Chi- 
cago to see how The Complete Graphics System went from be- 
ing an experiment to becoming the cornerstone of a new com- 
pany. 

Finally, in the companion story, we'll visit a distributor to 
see how the middle people view the market and what chances 
they offer the new programmer. 

Here we go: first stop, San Francisco. 

Training over Piroshki. It was September 1981, and the San 
Francisco Apple User's Group meeting had been cancelled. 
Unfortunately, three men standing in the parking lot had not 
been informed. 

One of them suggested they get a bite to eat before trek- 
king homeward. Thus the Praha Deli at 22nd and Geary be- 
came host to some of the most creative people in Appledom. It 
was here that the games Track Attack and Labyrinth were 
both conceived. 

Over their piroshki, Doug Carlston, his brother Gary, and 
Chris Jochumson, all with Broderbund Software, began talk- 
ing about how to design a game. Doug recalls drawing out a 
legal pad and taking notes. "Usually I provide a framework. 
This time, I said, 'Okay, let's talk about a train game.' " 

Carlston selected trains because he was looking for motion 
and with its designer, Jochumson, there, had in mind Space

THE EVOLUTION OF SOFTWARE 



BV DALE ARCHIBALD 




Quarks. Trains, like quarks, are things in a row that follow in a 
path. 

Riding the Bails. "We drew several maps of tracks and 
tried to figure out what you would do with tracks and a train 
running around on them. 

"One idea was that you'd control the switches at ten differ- 
ent intersections and you'd be steering a little handcar around 
trying to avoid getting run over. Your only control would be the 
digits from 0 to 9, and you could use each one of them to flip a 
switch on the screen. Presumably, there'd be more and more 
trains as time went on, and you'd have to have some goal. 
You'd be trying to repair the line or something like that." 

Another idea came quickly. "We expanded the map to have 
roads and tracks intertwined and looked again for interaction 
that made sense. At first, cars just had to avoid getting run 
over by trains; that didn't seem like much fun. Then we 
thought, 'What if you could just shoot the cars right through the 
trains at different intervals — and why would you want to do 
that anyway?' " 

For a while, then, they just noshed and talked. Maze games 
were touched on — the result being Labyrinth. 

The group designed a demolition derby no one liked be- 
cause it involved too many shapes and having to turn through 
too many angles. "Unless you did transformation, you'd have 
to stick all those shapes in separately and then preshift, and 
that would chew up huge amounts of memory— though I don't 
see anything wrong with that." 

The shapes, Doug says, are typically eighty percent of the 
program code in terms of memory allocation. 

The Play's the Thing. In the next stage of program design, 
a programmer chooses an idea to play with for a while. Joch- 
umson, Doug remembers, asked for the notes on Track Attack 
and began looking over the mustard-smeared yellow sheet. 

"A week or two later, he came in with a screen he wanted to 
show me. The track and the paths were pretty well laid out— it 
changed very little since. From that point, if anyone else took 



an interest in the idea, we'd tell them, 'Forget it, Chris is run- 
ning with that one.' That prevents two people working on the 
same thing." 

Broderbund looks first for fun in a game. "If it won't be fun, 
what does it need? Is it too simple, or too complex, or too hard 
to understand? What game controllers will be used to manipu- 
late the different things on the screen is a limiting factor." 

Controls weren't the problem with Track Attack. "We de- 
cided, however, the game didn't have enough substance. It 
needed a couple of additional levels." 

At the original meeting, an idea of Gary Carlston's had 
been dismissed; now it was to be reconsidered. "Gary's idea 
was for the player to control a person trying to run along the 
roof of a train to the front, jumping over low-lying branches, 
ducking tunnels, and generally avoiding all kinds of dangers 
that would be pictured whipping across the screen." 

Now, they considered a simplification; Jochumson had fig- 
ured out how to scroll a big, colorful train across the screen 
but not how to put in the background Without slowing the pro- 
gram down noticeably. They decided to use the simplified ver- 
sion, the only peril being the jump from car to car, as the sec- 
ond level of Track Attack. 

"To tie it together so it would make sense, we came up with 
a skeleton story line. In level one, you'd attempt to drive 
through the box cars to steal gold from the cargo. Presuma- 
bly, taking the whole train would be a much more efficient way 
to get all the gold, so, on level two, you attempt to take control 
of the train and run to a level three. This is not really very dif- 
ficult to program since it uses the same routines as level one." 

Shaving Points. Further refinements followed, incl Xing 
having the score you get on level three dependent on your score 
from level one. 

"The purpose of the multiplier idea was to &dd i . calcula- 
tion of risk: 'Is this the right time to move on t ihe next level, 
or should I lie back here, where it's easier, ar keep piling up 
points, then risk it all in one grand effort?'

MAY 1982 



"What we were trying to do there is fairly intuitive. We're 
trying to give players an opportunity to calculate risk factors, 
so that there are more things to consider than just holding the 
button down and zapping the aliens." 

Doug believes this to be crucial to the making of a lasting 
game. "Most good games have alternative strategies avail- 
able. If you look at any really decent game, it doesn't have a 
simple solution that, once handled, makes you master of the 
game forever and ever." 

As Chris continued to work on Track Attack, he would bring 
in various versions. Doug says there were at least twenty over 
time. 

"They were at different stages," Gary says. "We'd all go 
over them. For example, Chris was real disturbed by flicker; 
it was causing him to lose interest in the whole game. So we put 
it to a vote, most of us turned out to consider it insignificant, 
and the consensus convinced Chris to move on to new things." 

True Obsessions. Programmers also become attached to 
certain parts of a program. "Chris had done a real ding-dong 
explosion sequence. When the car and train collided, the impact 
threw up a little white cloud and went 'beep-beep-beep-beep.' 
Everybody thought it was awful, but Chris loved it. It took us 
about a month and a half to talk him out of it." 

Features are added one at a time. And then there are bugs. 
"For a long time, level two and level three didn't interface at 
all. You could look at one and you could look at the other, but 
you couldn't move between them. 

"In an earlier stage, it was almost impossible to get the car 
through the train to steal the gold. You had to be so precise it 
was no fun at all. We said, 'Let's just loosen up those windows 
so that if the car's anywhere near the right spot it will count as 
having gone through it,' That isn't the place to penalize 
people. 

"We added the phantom watch car in the process of mak- 
ing escalating levels of difficulty. At first, we were going to 
have no cars, then one watch car, then two, and so on. Ulti- 
mately, we decided that two cars made the game slow down 



too much. In the end, we chose to keep one car in there all the 
time. 

"One of the last additions — this was Chris's idea — was that 
the phantom car be able to steal your gold from your stock- 
pile; then you could wrest it from the phantom if you could 
catch it before it put the gold back in stock. That was just a fil- 
lip to make one more thing to keep track of. We had had com- 
plaints that level one was just a little simple-minded. We try to 
think of ways to stay within the story line while adding com- 
plexity to the game to distract people's focus of attention as 
much as possible." 

It takes about six weeks normally to get everything to- 
gether at Broderbund once they know what the finished pro- 
gram will look like. Track Attack took longer because of re- 
curring bugs. "Programmers go on working on their games: 
Final version, final final, final final final." 

No Reprieve. "We test programs extensively. After protec- 
tion is added we test again, because sometimes the protection 
interferes. Then we add quick-load and test it to death. And we 
test it here; we don't send games out of house. 

"We pass a couple of dozen copies around the office, and 
people play it all the time, looking for any kind of bugs. We 
found a lot of them in Track Attack, but I don't think there are 
any in the version that went out." 

Jochumson began working on the program in September 
1981. By early December, it had essentially been finished. 

Simultaneous with the programming, Broderbund had an 
artist working on the artwork for Track Attack. 

Meanwhile, Doug says, "We got Chris to write out the rules 
longhand, so we didn't miss anything. After all, the program- 
mer knows the rules better than anyone else." Gary usually 
writes the final instructions and story line for Broderbund 
games. Doug and sister Cathy go over them to find errors. 
They added a story line to the explanation to give it more 
flavor. Then the graphics design people designed a package 
around it.

I WANT TO BE A SOFTWARE HERO 



Bohlig and Associates, Minneapolis, Minnesota, is a stock- 
ing distributor — they buy products from a manufacturer, keep 
them in stock, and sell to retailers. Chuck Bohlig has been in 
the electronics industry more than twenty years, in computers 
for four. 

While his wife Diane manages the office, Chuck, with sons 
Steve and Jeffrey, sells throughout Minnesota, Iowa, Wiscon- 
sin, and the Dakotas. They handle a number of respected lines, 
including Microsoft, MicroPro, VisiCorp, Qume, Novation, 
Zenith Data Systems, and others. They do not sell games. 

Because they are respected, the firm receives five or six let- 
ters a week from would-be software publishers, Bohlig says. 
"We are besieged with hardware and software. 

"Somebody will call up and say, 'I'm the author of XYZ 
program for the Apple. I've sold to a couple of dealers and I'd 
like you to distribute my product.' 

"We ask a number of screening questions to find out what 
he's trying to do, what sort of a level he's gone to in supporting 
that product." 

It's not who you know. 

A few of the questions Bohlig asks are : 

1. What does it do? 

2. What are the features? 

3. What sort of equipment does it run on? 

4. Did you write it? 

5. What sort of languages did you write it in? 

6. Is it compatible only with the Apple? 

7. Could it be sold with other systems? 

8. What sort of documentation is available? 

9. How are you marketing it? Is it a product you have to 



support personally, or is it a mass-market-type product that 
can be supported by a distributor training dealers who train 
the customers? 

Bohlig warns that the majority of consumers are no longer 
sophisticated users who know all the ins and outs of a comput- 
er. "To sell more and more computers, you have to be able to 
sell the people who do not understand what DOS 3.3 is, or what 
the word 'boot' is. You have to be able to give customers soft- 
ware packages with manuals that will allow them to open a 
package and operate it." 

Bohlig answers with no hesitation when asked what most 
would-be publishers lack: "Documentation! That's the weak- 
est point. 

"It's more important to us than 'Does the actual disk 
work?' We assume that the program has some value, or has 
some function, but is it friendly enough so that a person can 
buy it straight from a dealer's shelf, boot it up, and attempt to 
run it? That's where we see the biggest problem." 

Four-Letter Word. From his experience, Bohlig looks for 
help. "What can you do to help the user? Is there a help menu 
on the program? Is it understandable, or do they have to look at 
the screen and refer back to the manual with some degree of 
difficulty? The easier it is, the better the customer's going to 
like it. 

"Don't even assume the person knows how to insert the disk 
and turn the machine on. We see some stuff that assumes you 
know how to boot it up and how to put CP/M on the disk . . . 
and it doesn't happen that way. 

"You have to be able to write for the lowest level," Bohlig 
stresses. 

Other areas of weakness are:

pie who do the packaging, but Broderbund does the ordering 
from one of three printers it does business with. 

Production, Doug notes, "starts duplicating disks off as 
soon as we're convinced there are no bugs in the master, often 
long before we have the packaging. That way they can sched- 
ule a steady work flow in the department. 

"There were more than three thousand prerelease orders 
for Track Attack, and if we'd waited to duplicate until we had 
the packaging, it would have been a couple of weeks before 
we'd have been able to get the shipments out." 

The process of marketing doesn't end when the product's 
shipped. 

Advertising, Doug says, hasn't always worked out well. 
"Track Attack, we thought, would be ready about three 
months before it was. It was supposed to be advertised a 
month early and, due to the delays, the ads ended up about four 
months early. Midnight Magic wasn't advertised until two 
weeks after it had been released. Something like Starblazer 
won't be advertised at all." 

The company has earmarked a lot of its budget for what 
Doug calls sneak previews. 

"We're sending out enormous numbers of demos around 
the country as a way of generating interest on the part of the 
stores. That's where a big chunk of money is going; we're also 
putting a lot more into shows." 

Another growing segment of the ad budget is packaging. 
"The packaging is a lot more expensive than it was last year. 
It's heavy cardboard, and we're spending much more on art- 
work and design. We're basing it on the theory that people are 
buying the product, and not the hype. We consider the packag- 
ing a part of the product, and not part of the hype." ' 

Initial sales figures, generally, are based on advance 
orders from major distributors. "We sell about ninety-five 
percent through major distributors, and we have twenty-seven 
of them." No wonder Track Attack is doing well; there are few 



places where you can't get it if you want it. Yet, barely more 
than a year ago, Broderbund's distribution representation was 
less than ten percent of the marketplace. 

Now we'll visit a company so young, their duration of wide- 
spread distribution must be measured in weeks to get a two- 
digit number. 

Birds Do It. From the wilds of the midwest, twenty seven- 
year-old Mark Pelczarski of Penguin Software has followed his 
own program publishing odyssey, with the aid and support of 
his wife Cheryl. 

In 1979, Pelczarski bought an Apple to see what micros 
could do that big computers couldn't. "Graphics seemed to be 
one of the big things. The first thing I did, first month or so, was 
write what turned out to be the framework of The Complete 
Graphics System. " 

Pelczarski wrote a shape table generator and a hi-res draw- 
ing program, along with the beginnings of the 3-D program. 
"By today's standards, it was nothing fancy at all, but, after I 
had polished it up, I took it to some computer stores — I had a 
32K Apple and a disk drive, and I wanted to trade for accesso- 
ries." 

Apple Trading Cards. "When I first started selling, I would 
make up a bunch of packages, take them into stores, and say 
'Why don't you give or sell these to your customers — I need 
16K more memory,' or a new Integer card, or this and that. 
That's how I got most of the equipment to put in my original 
Apple." 

Using Apple Writer to write the instructions over a two- 
week period, he recalls, "The original manuals were run off on 
an IDS printer and Xeroxed." 

The rough-and-ready packaging was zip-lock bags "from 
the local grocery store. Inside was an instruction book 
Xeroxed on one weight of paper, the cover laid out with press- 
on lettering and Xeroxed onto heavy, colored cardboard stock. 

"I sent copies around to several publishers, magazines, and 



1. Error-trapping. Bohlig judges it "fair-to-middling." 

2. Packaging. "Very important to the end sale. If it's a 
$49.95 program, let it look like a $49.95 program. But if a per- 
son's going to lay out $300 to $500 they expect more than a 
mimeographed sheet. When you're talking that sort of cost, 
you really should have a typeset manual. Over $100, as a rule of 
thumb, should be typeset." 

3. Terms. "Publishers feel 10 or 15 percent should be ade- 
quate for us. They don't understand sometimes that we pay for 
it on agreed terms, whether C.O.D., net fifteen, net thirty, or 
whatever. We inventory it on the shelf, and we then offer terms 
and a discount to the dealer. 

"By the time you carry the product for thirty or forty-five 
days, it starts costing you interest money to handle that. 
You've got to price the product to be competitive, but also to 
give your distributors and your dealers adequate margins. 

"The better the margin the dealer has, the more he's going 
to push that product. There's no money in hardware; soft- 
ware's the only other place where you can overcome losses 
generated by having to compete with mail order and such." 

Insect Insurance. He suggests Beta-testing from some "dis- 
interested party" who's not intimately involved with the pro- 
gram is of great help, and the distributor should be notified of 
the levels of testing it has gone through. What has the compa- 
ny done to ensure that a correction won't cause another bug? 

"How do they want to market it? Are they going to bring it 
in with a handbill flyer, or is the distributor to do all the promo- 
tion? Are they going to do some national advertising in the 
magazines, and are they prepared to do that? If so, how big?" 
Lack of money will affect this marketing area particularly. 

Design we; . : esses, Bohlig points out, lie in programmers' 
"not understanding what they want to accomplish. The 
mechanics of the program, all the listings, can be outstanding. 
But the programmer must understand what the target cus- 
tomer needs and what the program will be able to do for 
them." 



Publishers often don't study how a distributor's market is 
broken down. 

"They don't understand the mechanics of distribution. Do 
they want to be picked up by a large publisher, or publish it 
themselves? If they have a store, they should use a different 
name and telephone number for publishing. 

"The other thing is the ability to produce the program once 
they have it all designed and ready for market. Are they going 
to be able to fulfill the needs?" 

Chuck feels premature advertising is disastrous. "All a 
small company has is credibility, and once it loses that through 
use of a post office box address or by prematurely advertising 
a product to see if demand will develop, they're lost." 

Crash Course. For novices who would like to sell software 
or hardware, here are some pointers. 

If you have a sales representative handling your product, 
you will pay a percentage of the sale price to that rep. 

If you sell to a distributor, you will have to price your prod- 
uct for them. Each of these so-called breaks (price breaks) are 
based on the retail price of the package. 

Assume you have a software package you feel should sell 
for $100. You will be expected to sell that product to a stocking 
distributor for around 50 percent of retail, or $50. If your sales 
representative sold the package to the distributor and earns 10 
percent commission, you will end up with $45. 

The distributor in turn will sell it to a retailer for 25-30 per- 
cent off the retail price. 

Terms might be Net 30, which means the net total is due in 
thirty days, EOM for end of month, 2/10 Net 30 for 2 percent off 
the price if paid within ten days, the net due in thirty, or some 
other combination. 

If you sell your $100 program to a department store, you 
may be asked to give a 50/10 break. This equates to 50 percent 
of $100, then another 10 percent off the $50. Should the sales rep 
also earn 10 percent, you will end up with $40.50 
($100-$50-$5-$4.50=$40.50). HI

Exploring Business Basic, 
Part 8 

All the planning in the world about 
which Business Basic topics need to be 
covered can be undone by a simple ques- 
tion from a Basic user. This month's col- 
umn is devoted to just such a simple 
question, one from a programmer with a 
database application to implement, who 
asks, "How can I use random access files 
to look up records when the record num- 
bers I want to use are nonnumeric or ex- 
ceed the 32767 record limit?" Next month 
we'll return to graphics to explore char- 
acter sets and animation, but for now, 
this question is fundamental to the re- 
quirements of lots of applications. 

Slinging the Hash. The technique our 
intrepid questioner needs to know about 
is something called hashing. In general, 
this refers to using some mathematical 
operation on a value (string or numeric) 
to obtain a new value that is within the 
range of desired values. Here's a typical 
example. 

In a file that will maintain records on 
only one thousand employees, it makes 
sense to use their social security numbers 
(nine digits — a billion possible values) as 
reference numbers for direct lookup of 
information. In this particular situation, 
a formula is required to convert the nine- 
digit number into a three-digit number. 
The resulting three-digit number then 
can be used to look up the employee rec- 
ord, providing that the formula resolves 
each of the social security numbers into a 
unique three-digit number. 

It's in this area of resolving unique 
record numbers from more complex key 
values that hashing techniques get inter- 
esting. In our example, it's easy to 
imagine simply dropping the first six 
digits of the number to obtain a three- 
digit result. In that case, 229-49-7128 be- 
comes simply 128. In this way, 305-47-6024 
would refer to 24, and 906-28-2935 would 
become record 935. Actually, in the case 
of social security numbers, this tech- 
nique is not all that bad. Although there 




are many (a million to be exact) differ- 
ent social security numbers that end in a 
given three digits, in a random selection 
of employees, the chances of having 
many with the same last three digits are 
fairly small. 

In a few minutes we'll see that the 
phrase "fairly small" is cause for a sig- 
nificant amount of programming effort 
to deal with duplicates, but for now, con- 
sider that other key values (that is, 
values which are used as keys in looking 
up records) present even more interest- 
ing problems. Dealing with a key value 
like 305-47-6024 may seem like a straight- 
forward problem, but consider what 290- 
AR37BH would do to our simple scheme 
of using the last three digits. 

In fact, there is no telling what the 
structure of many key values might be. 
Suppose we used part numbers that all 
varied in the first three digits instead of 
the last! Each of our three digit hashed 
keys would be identical, rendering the 
whole scheme useless. A more ideal tech- 
nique would be to perform operations on 
the entire key value, thereby generating 
a reasonably random value within the 
range of record numbers our file could 
contain. If this generated value results in 
a "random" value, we can assume that 
the distribution of values in the data 
space (the set of all possible hashed rec- 
ord numbers) is reasonably uniform, 
with minimum conflicts. Diagram 1 rep- 
resents the desired result.

There are many techniques for gen- 
erating such hashed values from alpha- 
numeric keys. The sample program that 
follows lets you experiment with one such 



method.

20 


INPUT"Maximum record number: ";r$ 


22 


IF r$="" THEN GOTO 




50:ELSE:recordmax& = CONV&(r$) 


25 


INPUT"Your key value: " ; a$ 


27 


IF a$ = "" THEN 20 


28 


PRINT"Key length = ";LEN(a$) 


30 


GOSUB 1500 


35 


PRINT"Derived value is: "a&" hash is: ";key& 


40 


GOTO 25 


50 


END 


1500 


a&=l;lstring = LEN(a$) 


1502 


FOR i=l TO Istring 


1505 


ascval = ASC(MID$(a$,i,l)) 


1510 


a& = a& +CONV&(ascval*2 A i H-ascval* 




3A(lstring-i+l)) 


1520 


NEXT i 


1525 


key& = a& MOD recordmax& 


1530 


RETURN 



This program asks first for your maxi- 
mum record number. This creates a 
value, recordmaxd, which is used as the 
upper limit on hash — key generation. The 
subroutine at line 1500 actually gen- 
erates the hash value from the alphanu- 
meric input in line 25. It works by going 
through each character position in the 
key and converting it to its ASCII equiva- 
lent (line 1505). 

Then a number is generated in line 
1510 (ascval*2 a i + ascval*3 a 
(lstring-i+1) by multiplying the value 
by a power of two dependent on the char- 
acter position in the string and adding the 
product of the value times a power of 
three equivalent to its position relative to 
the end of the string. This effectively gen- 
erates considerably different numbers, 
even if the original value differed only by 
one in the last position. It also minimizes 
duplicates, resulting in reversing the or- 
der of the characters, which a simple 
sum would not. 

Once this calculated value is pro- 
duced, it is reduced to the range of the 
data space by the modulus function mod

in line 1525. Remember that mod gives 
the remainder of dividing by the record- 
max& value and thus guarantees a value 
between 0 and recordmaxd-L Line 35 
prints the result of this calculation, giv- 
ing you a feeling for how different hash 
values can be for some very similar key 
values. Type this program in and try it 
for various key values to be sure you un- 
derstand what's going on. 

Once you've tried the program with 
various key values, try rerunning it with 
a very small data space. In other words, 
use something like 11 or 7 for the maxi- 
mum record number. You'll quickly dis- 
cover that lots of very different key 
values will produce the same hash value. 
This is the fundamental problem with 
hashing techniques, since each duplicate 
hash value represents a potential con- 
flict in the file. Ah well, nothing good 
comes easy! 

One way to test the ideal data space 
sizes against various numbers of records 
to hash is to use a file of random key 
values. The following program will cre- 
ate a junkfile filled with nine character 
key values for test purposes: 

10 PRINT"Random key generation program" 
15 OPEN#l, "junkfile" 

25 INPUT"Number of records to generate: ";n 
30 FOR ival=l TO n 
35 a$=" " 

40 FOR i=l TO 5:SUB$(a$,j,l) 

=CHR$(65+INT(26*RND(1))):NEXT j 

45 FOR k=6 TO 9:SUB$(a$,k,l) 
= 48+INT(10*RND(l))) : NEXT k 

47 PRINT a$ 

60 NEXT ival 

80 CLOSE 

90 END 

The only thing of real note in this pro- 
gram is the use of the sub$ function to 
speed up the string generation, as com- 
pared to the use of the + (concatena- 
tion) operator. In any case, this program 
will generate a file of random keys, with 
the first five positions alphabetic, and the 
last four numeric. 

This next program will read the file 
and allow you to experiment with the size 
of the data space compared to the num- 
ber of records to be loaded, and print out 
a simple picture of the number of 



conflicts.

1505 ascval=ASC(MID$(a$,i,l)) 

1510 a& = a&+CONV&(ascval*2Ai+ascval*3 

(Istring - i + 1)) 
1520 NEXT i 

1525 key& = a& MOD recordmaxfi. 
1530 RETURN 

A typical run of the program will pro- 
duce output similar to the following: 

Hash key evaluation program 

Number of records in trial data space: 100 
Number of records to read: 50 
0200006000000000 1 000030000 1 000040000 
3000020000 1 000040000200002000020000 
3000020004000030000 1 00004000 

As can be seen from the program, 
each digit position of the printout repre- 
sents a different key value, and the num- 
ber in the position represents the num- 
ber of key values that hashed to that lo- 
cation. Based on the output above, the 
hashing appears far from random. The 
conflicts bunch up at intervals of ap- 
proximately five, with lots of empty 
space in between. You should get similar 
results, even with a different junkfile. 
Now try the program again, with a slight 
change : 

Hash key evaluation program 

Number of records in trial data space: 97 

Number of records to read: 50 

1 1 022000000000 1 0 1 1 00 1 000000000 1 0 1 00 

1 1 0 1 0 1 000 1 0200000000 1 000 1 1 1 00002 1 

01211001100001010123002202102 

Notice that the entries are not nearly 
so regular this time. There are still con- 
flicts (indicated by the 2s and 3s in the 
list), but they are scattered about with- 
out a definite pattern. You might argue 
that this distribution is not random, since 
there is still bunching up of values. Ex- 
amine the following program, which does 
produce a reasonably random distribu- 
tion, and see what happens. 

10 PRINT"Random distribution program" 

12 PRINT:INPUT"Number of records in data space: 

",-recordmax 
20 DIM fill%(1000) 

25 INPUT"Number of random numbers to gen- 
erate: ";n 
30 FOR ival=l TO n 
50 key=INT(recordmax*RND(l)) 
55 fill %(key) = fill%(key)+ 1 
60 NEXT ival 

65 FOR i = 0 TO recordmax-1 
70 PRINT fill%(i) ; 
75 NEXT i 
85 END 

The result from your runs should look 
something like this: 

Random distribution program 

Number of records in data space: 97 
Number of random numbers to generate: 50 
00 1002000101111001 00 100000010001110 
1 11 00 1 2 1 0 1 0 1 1 000 1 30020 1 00000 1 000000 
3000101 10001010210212100001 

Each time you run this program, the 
results will be different, but similar. True 



random distributions tend to be bunchy 
and definitely nonuniform, in the sense 
that there will typically be conflicts un- 
less the data space is very large in com- 
parison to the number of entries. 

Now comes the real question. If you 
were following along, you may have tried 
the last program with the first set of 
numbers (data space = 100, entries = 50) . 
Notice that the same regular bunching 
occurs as occurred in the sample run 
with junkfile. This suggests (although the 
actual proof is something we won't cover 
here) that more regular distributions can 
be obtained by using numbers like 97 in- 
stead of 100. Yes, there's only a differ- 
ence of three between them, but there is a 
much more important difference : 97 is a 
prime number, while 100 is obviously not. 
Using nonprime numbers as data space 
values is almost certain to create nonran- 
dom bunching of record numbers, and 
thus, lots of conflicts. The simple pro- 
gram that follows will rapidly allow you 
to pick prime numbers as candidates for 
data space values in your programs. 

5 INPUT"Range of prime number search: ",-y,z 

10 IF z = 0 THEN 80 

15 FOR j = y TO z 

20 IF j/2=INT(j/2) THEN 65 

30 FOR i=3 TO SQR(j) STEP 2 

40 IF j/i = INT(j/i) THEN 65 

50 NEXT i 

60 PRINT"The number "j" is prime" 
65 NEXT j 
70 GOTO 5 
80 END 

If necessary, this program can be con- 
verted easily into a subroutine for use in 
larger programs that need to set data 
space sizes based on estimates on the to- 
tal number of expected records in the 
file. 

Summing Up. The enormous volume 
of expository material you've just waded 
through was designed to show ways to 
produce a random record number from 
an arbitrary collection of characters 
called a key value. In the process we dis- 
cussed the potential problem of conflicts, 
where two (or more) different key values 
would hash to the same record number. 
Dealing with these conflicts is the most 
challenging part of programming file ac- 
cess methods using hashing. Before we 
get into an actual database program that 
uses these techniques, it would be worth- 
while to think about ways to reduce con- 
flicts and improve performance. 

Hash rule number 1: Use a hash 
method that obtains as random as possi- 
ble a distribution of physical record num- 
bers. Remember that we used prime 
numbers as divisors in the examples 
above, in addition to doing a substantial 
amount of arithmetic on the key values 
themselves. There are other methods 
(any good reference will talk about radix 
transforms, and so on), but the prime di- 
visor method is a good all around choice. 

Hash rule number 2: Use as large a 
data space as possible, compared with 
the total number of expected records, so 



that the hashed records are spread out 
with minimum conflict. We are fortu- 
nate to have a file system on the Apple III 
that allocates disk blocks only when they 
are used. This suggests that the actual 
overhead of using large data spaces is 
not very significant. 

It's easy to imagine using a data 
space of approximately five thousand 
records to contain a probable maximum 
of 1,000 physical records, since the over- 
head of such a scheme may only be a few 
extra index blocks. This kind of five-to- 
one ratio of data space to physical rec- 
ords will cut conflicts to the point where 
they do not affect performance. Com- 
pare this to randomizing 1,000 records in- 
to a 1,200 record space, where nearly 
every hashed record will conflict with an- 
other, and the probabilities are that some 
may have as many as four or five con- 
flicts. 

Hash rule number 3: For maximum 
performance, use the extra memory of 
the Apple III to maintain all conflict 
tables, and minimize the amount of shuf- 
fling of disk records required to resolve 
conflicts. This rule seems like common 
sense, but remember that most hash 
techniques were developed in the main- 
frame computer days, when disks were 
fast and memory expensive. Today's per- 
sonal computer world is exactly the op- 
posite, and requires restructuring of the 
approach to hashed file access.

we've discussed has been theoretical. But 
if you've done the exercises as we went 
along, you should be able to absorb the 
following rather complex program in

In line 5 several arrays are set up to 
deal with pointer mechanisms that will 
be used later. Primary% contains the list 
of all records which are in conflict with 
other records previously entered. Sec- 
ondary% contains the physical record 
numbers where these conflicting records 
are stored, along with a link to any other 
conflicting records which hash to the same 
value. Trial% is used later to maintain 
conflict lists for search purposes, and 
chron% contains a chronological list of all 
physical record numbers that have been 
used. The structures of primary% and 
secondary% are shown in diagram 2. 

The subroutine at line 1980 sets up 
these initial values and establishes a 
function (nospace) that checks to see if 
there is room left in the conflict lists for 
entries :

60 GOSUB 2000 

If the database is to be created from 
scratch, the subroutine at line 2000 takes 
care of the initialization of all arrays and 
values, and then physically writes them 
to the newly created file. 

2000 primary%(0,0) = 0:primary% 

(0, 1 ) = maxprimary% 
2010 secondary%(0,0) = 0:secondary%

Those of you who followed the article 
on request.inv a few months ago know of 
a faster way of doing file reads and 
writes. In larger implementations of this 
technique, these high-performance op- 
tions really come in handy. 

After initialization of the internal vari- 
ables, an option list is presented, and 
each of the options (add, delete, find, and 
list) uses its own subroutine for the par- 
ticular task: 

100 PRINT"Type:" 

105 PRINT" 1 to add a record" 

110 PRINT" 2 to delete a record" 

115 PRINT" 3 to find a record" 

120 PRINT" 4 to list all records" 

155 PRINT:INPUT"Your selection: " ; a$ 

160 IF a$ = "" THEN 200:ELSE:a=CONV(a$) 

162 IF a<l OR a>4 THEN 170 

165 ON a GOSUB 500,600,700,900 

170 PRINLGOTO 100 

Let's look at first things first, exam- 
ining the add routine in the subroutine at 
line 500: 

500 PRINT:INPUT"Part number: " ; part$ 

505 IF part$ = "" THEN RETURN 

510 IF LEN(part$)> 10 THEN PRINT"Part number 

too long, reenter":GOTO 500 
520 PRINT:INPUT"Description: ",desc$ 
530 IF LEN(desc$)>15 THEN PRINT"Description 

too long, reenter" :GOTO 520 
535 PRINT:INPUT"Location: ";loc$ 
540 IF LEN(loc$)>10 THEN PRINT"Location too 

long, reenter":GOTO 535 



Imina 

545 PRINT:INPUT"Quantity: " ; quan$ 
550q = CONV(quan$):IF q>9999 THEN 
PRINT"quantity too large, reenter":GOTO 545 
555 quantity% = q 

560 PRINT:PRINT"Record is: "part$"l"desc$" 

l"loc$"l"quantity%"l, ok?"; 
565 INPUT"" ; a$ 

570 IF a$<>"Y" AND a$<>"y" THEN 
PRINLGOTO 500 

This part is pretty straightforward. It 
simply accepts the values, does minimal 
editing for length and value, and then re- 
prints the record in line 560 to allow the 
user to verify that everything was cor- 
rectly entered. 

Next, things get a bit sticky. 

575 a$ = part$ 
580 GOSUB 1500 

Line 1500 contains our old familiar 
routine, hashing a record number from 
the part number value: 

1500 a&=l: lstring = LEN(a$) 
1502 FOR i=l TO Istring 
1505 ascval=ASC(MID$(a$,i,l)) 
1510 a& = a&+CONV&(ascval*2 A i + 

ascval*3 A (Istring— i+ 1)) 
1520 NEXT i 

1525 key& = a& MOD recordmaxi 
1530 RETURN 

The next sequence of events adds one 
hundred to the resulting record number, 
clearing all the data we might want to 
write to the beginning of the file, and then 
calls the routine at line 1800 to determine 
and deal with the writing of the record 
and the conflicts, if any occur: 

585 recordnum% = CONV%(key&)+100 
590 GOSUB 1800 

595 IF errorcode=l THEN PRINT"Tables full, 

cannot add a conflicting record." :RETURN 
597 PRINT:PRINT"record added."=RETURN 



The add routine at 1800 is nontrivial. It 
first determines (in line 1800 to line 1810) 
if a conflicting record already exists in 
the primary% conflict list. Line 1807 is 
particularly interesting in that, as we 
shall see later in the delete routine, flag- 
ging a conflict with a negative sign 
means that the conflicting record has 
been deleted and can be reused. 

Note that after scanning the table, 
lines 1815 and 1820 check to see if the 
physical record contains a string value as 
its first variable. If it doesn't, the record 
is considered available. If the record 
does contain a string value, the record is 
considered occupied, with the initial 
string variable equal to the part number, 
which is actually the element we use as 
the hash key. 

1800 FOR i=l TO primary%(0,0) 
1805 IF primary%(i,0) = recordnum% THEN 1830 
1807 IF ABS(primary%(i,0)) = recordnum% THEN

currents% = secondary%(0,0) 

1 826 primary%(currentp%, 1 ) = currents% 

1829 GOTO 1855 

Lines 1821 through 1929 deal with first- 
time conflicts and create a new primary 
record, along with locating a place to en- 
ter the physical secondary record num- 
ber. This record number is obtained by 
the routine starting at line 1855. The rou- 
tine at 1855 is also used in the event that 
the normal scan of primary conflict rec- 
ords (line 1805 above) discovers a dupli- 
cate entry. The routine at line 1830 
searches the list of primary and sec- 
ondary records until the end of the con- 
flict list is found. At that point trialrec% is 
set to the next suspected available rec- 
ord, and execution goes to 1855 to find a 
physical record into which to put our en- 
try. Note that line 1837 ensures that de- 
leted entries in the conflict list are auto- 
matically reused.

1880 secondary%(currents°/o,0)=trialrec% 
1 885 secondary%(currents%, 1 ) = 0 
1890 recordnum% = trialrec% 

Note that lines 1865 through 1890 add 
the new conflict entry to the list in sec- 
ondary% and set the physical record 
number recordnum% to the final trial 
record value.

Lines 1900 through 1905 then actually 
write the record values to the file, add the 
record number to the chronological list, 
and set the modify flag to let the pro- 
gram know that a change has been made 
to the file and the arrays. 

Notice also that the path through all 
this code is extremely trivial if there is no 
conflict in the use of record numbers. In 
that case, execution sails through the 
loop in lines 1800 through 1810, checks the 
record for previous contents in lines 1815 
and 1820 and, finding none, jumps to line 
1900 to write the record and update the 
list. As long as there are no conflicts, this

technique is very fast, and when con- 
flicts do exist, there's a minimum of 
searching for a free record as long as the 
data space is significantly larger than the 
total number of records. 

Having covered the use of hashing to 
add records, finding records becomes 
somewhat the reverse process of going 
back through the list. 

700 PRINT:INPUT"Part number: " ; part$ 
705 IF part$ = "" THEN RETURN 
710 IF LEN(part$)>10 THEN PRINT 

"Part number too long, 

reenter":GOTO 700

715 GOSUB 1500 

720 recordnum% = CONV%(key&)+ 1 00 

725 GOSUB 1600

755 PRINT:INPUT"Press return 

to continue: ",-a$ 
760 RETURN 

After collecting the part number and 
generating the hash value using the sub- 
routine at 1500, line 725 goes to a subrou- 
tine that looks up records in the data- 
base. The tricky part about this is that 
there may be multiple records that have 
the same hash key (that is, are in con- 
flict) , so that it is necessary to assemble 
a list of all values from the primary and 
secondary conflict arrays, and then lines 
1671 through 1692 read each record to de- 
termine which one is the actual one be- 
ing sought. Note also that there is code in 
lines 1607 and 1662 to deal with the de- 
leted entries in the conflict lists.

1692 RETURN 

The last big section of the program 
deals with deleting records, and while it 
has been alluded to above, it is being 
mentioned third in the sequence of func- 
tions simply because it uses the find rou- 
tines to locate the record to be deleted. 

600 PRINT:INPUT"Part number: ",-part$ 

605 IF part$ = "" THEN RETURN 

610 IF LEN(part$)>10 THEN PRINT"Part number 

too long, reenter":GOTO 700

615 GOSUB 1500

625 GOSUB 1600 

630 IF errorcode= 1 THEN PRINT"Part number not 

found.":GOTO 600 
635 PRINT:PRINT"Delete: "parti $"l 

"desc$"l"loc$"l"Quantity%"l ? " ; 
637 INPUT"" ; a$ 

640 IF a$<>"Y" AND a$<>"y" THEN PRINT"Not 
deleted":RETURN 

The first part of delete simply takes 
the part number information, hashes the 
key, and then in line 625, gosubs to the 
find routine to locate the particular part 
number record. If the record is found, the 
user is asked to confirm that it is the 
proper record to delete, and then the fun 
begins : 

645 IF conflict=l THEN 660 
650 record% = recordnum% 
655 GOTO 690 

Conflict is a flag set in the find rou- 
tine that tells delete whether or not there 
is cleanup work to be done in the conflict 
lists. If not, the record number is passed 
to 690 for physical deletion. If there is a 
conflict, then 660 through 670 find the pri- 
mary entry and check if that is the physi- 
cal record number to be deleted. If so, 
line 675 negates the entry. If not, the sec- 
ondary list is searched in lines 680 
through 688 until the proper entry is 
found and flagged. Then 690 through 695 
physically deletes the record and finds 
the entry in the chronological list, negat- 
ing that as well. Because entries are be- 
ing changed, the modify flag is set in 695. 

660 FOR i=l TO primary%(0,0) 

665 IF primary%(i,0) = recordnum% THEN 675 

670 NEXT i 

672 PRINT"Error in delete. Record not 

found":RETURN 
675 IF primary%(i,0) = record% THEN 

primary%(i,0)= -record%:GOTO 690 
680 lookup% = prfmary%(i,l) 
682 IF secondary%(lookup%,0) = record% 

THEN secondary%(lookup%,0) = 

-record%:GOTO 690 
685 IF secondary%(lookup%,l) = 0 

THEN 672 

687 lookup% = secondary%(lookup%, 1 ) 

688 GOTO 682 

690 WRITE#l,record%;0 
692 FOR i=l TO chron%(0) 



693 IF chron%(i) = record% THEN 
chron%(i). -record%:GOTO 695 

694 NEXT i 

695 PRINT:PRINT"Record deleted": 
modify=l:RETURN 

At Last, the End. The final routine in 
this program is the list, which is the sim- 
plest of all. 

900 IF chron%(0) = 0 THEN PRINT"No records to 
list":GOTO 930 

905 FOR i=l TO chron%(0) 

906 IF chron%(i)<0 THEN 920 

907 READ#l,chron%(i) 

908 IF TYP(1)<>4 THEN 920 

910 READ#l ; part$,desc$,loc$,quantity% 
915 PRINT USING"10a,2x,15a,2x,10a,x, 

4#";part$,desc$,loc$,quantity% 
920 NEXT i 

930 PRINT:INPUT"Press RETURN to continue: ";a$ 
935 RETURN 

List simply goes through the chrono- 
logical array, reads the physical record 
numbers (skipping deleted entries in line 
906) , and formats the information into a 
list. What a treat to see a simple, 
straightforward routine for once! 

Final wrap-up is all that is left: 

200 PRINT:PRINT"end of program" 

210 IF NOT modify THEN 220 

211 count=0 

212 FOR i=l TO chron%(0) 

214 IF chron%(i)>0 THEN count=count 

+ l:chron%(count) = chron%(i) 
216 NEXT i 

218 chron%(0) = count 

219 GOSUB 2020 

220 CLOSE:INVOKE 
230 END 

These lines handle quitting, checking 
the modify flag, and writing out the data 
if necessary. Note that before writing out 
the data a cleanup is done on the chron% 
list to remove deleted entries. 

Really the End. This has been a long 
and tough exercise, and you deserve a 
break. Go off to the refrigerator, get a 
cool beverage of your favorite persua- 
sion, and consider the fact that the pro- 
gram above can be easily modified to 
maintain almost any kind of data rec- 
ords, and the list routine can be used in 
conjunction with sorts and calculations to 
format almost any kind of report. The 
fact that this kind of capability can be de- 
veloped in Basic is a tribute to the power 
of the Apple in, Business Basic, and SOS, 
and not a bad testimony on your invest- 
ment. 

Just one word of caution is in order. 
For simplicity, many of the error check- 
ing routines that would be needed to turn 
this into a real application have been left 
out. If you get serious about using these 
kinds of techniques, take the time to an- 
ticipate all the things that could go wrong 
and put in tests for them. Also, to learn 
more about the techniques alluded to in 
this article, which fit the general cate- 
gory of access methods, check your li- 
brary for books on data structures, data- 
base theory, and indexed access meth- 
ods. And then have another cool one. . . .

THUNDERWARE'S DOS-DATER 

Our new DOS-DATER software upgrades the regular DOS on 
your disks so that DOS will use the THUNDERCLOCK to time- 
and-date-stamp disk files. Every time a program is saved or a file is 
modified, the current date and time to the minute are stored in 
the CATALOG with the file's name. You can tell at a glance when 
a program was saved or when any file was last modified. And this 
time/date stamping feature is completely automatic. That means 
any program which uses DOS will time/date stamp its files! 

REMOTE CONTROL 

Add Thunderware's X-10 INTERFACE OPTION to your 
THUNDERCLOCK PLUS and your APPLE can control lights and appliances through your BSR X-10 Home Control 
System on your pre-defined schedules. Our powerful SCHEDULER software allows you to create and modify 
schedules easily and execute them in the 'background', while using your APPLE for other tasks in the 'foreground'. 
Use your APPLE for energy management, display and security lighting, or laboratory/process control. 

Our PASCAL Software lets you use all the THUNDERCLOCK'S features in PASCAL and sets the F)iler date 
whenever you boot. 

You get all this versatility in just one peripheral system. Backed by a full one year warranty. See your APPLE dealer

A All / 

Subroutines are miniprograms (or programs within a pro- 
gram) that perform specific functions and then return control 
to your main program. They are very useful, since you can re- 
fer to them time and again within a program, always return- 
ing to the precise point from which you left off when you called 
them. 

Let's list this month's new vocabulary and then take a look 
at an example of a subroutine.

100 VTAB 23 

110 INPUT "GIVE ME A TITLE: " ; A$ 
120 VTAB 1: GOSUB 40: PRINT 
A$ 

130 REM NOW UNDERLINE THE TITLE 
140 GOSUB 40 

150 PRINT X = X + 1: IF X < L THEN 150 

This is a simple program that takes any title you give it and 
centers it at the top of the page. The subroutine that does the 
centering is located at line 40. The main program begins at line 
100 (and is jumped to by line 10) . Because of the way Applesoft 
works, a program will generally execute much faster if sub- 
routines are close to the beginning of a program. Therefore, it 
is best to leave space for them in the low line numbers and 
jump to a higher number for the body of your program. 

Now let's examine how this program works. Line 10 clears 
the screen and then jumps to line 100. Line 100 tells the Apple to 
move the cursor down the page to line 23 near the bottom of the 
screen (this is so that it doesn't get in the way of the title we are 
about to create). Then line 110 asks you to input a title and 
stores the phrase you give it in the string, A$. At line 120 we do 
a vertical tab back up to the first line on the screen. Then we 
hit the instruction gosub kO. 

This instruction transfers control to the subroutine at line 
40. This subroutine first finds the Zength of A$ and stores the 
value in L (to check this, type ?L on your computer right now; 
if you have run the program, L should be a number corre- 
sponding to the length of whatever phrase you entered) . It then 
does a horizontal tab equal to 20 (the midpoint of the screen) 
less half the length of A$. When A$ is printed, therefore, half of 
it will be to the left of the midline of the screen and half to the 
~ight. 

The final command in a subroutine is always return. This 
causes program control to return to the exact point it left when 
the gosub command was executed, in this case to the middle of 



program line 120. The third and final instruction in line 120 is 
executed next, causing A$ to be printed and the cursor to be 
moved to the beginning of the next line. 

Line 140 then sends us back to the same subroutine a sec- 
ond time. We are on the line below our title but in column 1. In 
order to underline we need to tab horizontally the correct num- 
ber of spaces so that we are underneath the first character of 
the title. That is what subroutine 40 is designed to do. 

Line 150 is a simple loop. It prints a dash (and the semi- 
colon in the print statement keeps us on the same line) . Then it 
adds 1 to a counter (X) and compares the counter with L (the 
length of the string A$) . If X is still less than L we loop back to 
line 150 to continue drawing dashes ; if X is equal to L we are 
finished and the program stops. 

This routine will work fine as long as the title given is less 
than forty characters in length. However, try it with a really 
long title, flllegal quantity error in U0 says the computer, and 
rightly so. Because, if your title is forty or more characters 
long, then L is equal to 40 or more, and HTAB 20 - L/2 will try 
to set a horizontal tab at 0 or less, which is more or less impos- 
sible. There are two ways of approaching this kind of problem. 
You can tell everyone likely to use your program to keep his or 
her titles short ; or (better) you can trap the problem in your 
program. Try adding the following line: 

115 IF LEN (A$) > 39 THEN PRINT 
"TOO LONG": GOTO 110 

That should do it. That also serves to illustrate a point about the 
if . . . then statement that may not have been clear before : if 
the if statement is true, then everything following on that line 
will be executed; however, if it is false, program control will 
immediately drop down to the next line of the program. In this 
example, if your title is too long, the message "Too long" is 
printed. Then control jumps to line 110. However, if the title is 
not too long, control immediately jumps to line 120. The com- 
puter doesn't even look at the rest of the commands on line 115. 

Since we have such a nice program going, why don't we just 
continue. The first thing we want to do is clear off any garbage 
on the screen other than the title. As you may recall, it is possi- 
ble to do this from the keyboard by typing ESC-F. The same 
command from within a program is CALL —958. CALL is the 
Applesoft command telling the program to jump to a specific 
location in memory, usually in order to make use of a ma- 
chine-language subroutine. A certain number of machine-lan- 
guage routines are built into the Apple. Here, we are jumping 
to a routine that has been built into the Apple ROM (read-only 
memory) , the routine that clears the screen from the cursor on 
down. 

The use of a negative number requires some explanation. 
As you may recall, a 48K Apple has memory with addresses 
numbered from 0 to 49151. In addition, Apples have 16K of 
ROM with addresses going from 49152 to 65536. Now, in the old- 
en days (pre-Applesoft) , it was impossible to use a number 
greater than 32768 (half of 65536) in a program because of the 
way integers are stored in memory. To test this, try typing the 
following line on your Apple: 

A% = 50000 

See what we mean? Integers run from -32767 to 32768. There- 



MAY 1982 



imnnt

fore, in order to refer to the high areas of memory, it was ne- 
cessary to use a subterfuge. Try the following: 

PRINT PEEK(65535),PEEK(-1) 

They are the same. What we did was start counting down from 
the top. What was 65535 became -1, 65534 became -2, and so 
forth. Vestiges of this counting system linger on, and negative 
numbers are usually used when we refer to addresses in the 
ROM. 

At any rate, the first line to add to our program should look 
like this: 

160 CALL - 958 

Now let's turn the Apple into a little word processor. Add 
the following lines: 

165 PRINT 
170 GET A$ 

180 PRINT A$ ;: GOTO 170 

Try this out and see how it works. Not too shabby, eh? Of 
course, it has a few little problems, like words that wrap 
around from one line to the next. But we ought to be able to 
take care of that. Try figuring out a simple solution for your- 
self before going on. 

Here is one way to do it. It won't handle everything, but it is 
very simple and works about 90 percent of the time. Just 
change line 170 to read as follows (and now might be a good 
time to brush up on insert editing; if you've inadvertently de- 
leted that information from your memory space, it's in the 
February Softalk) : 

170 GET A$:COLUMN = COLUMN -I- 1: IF 
COLUMN > 35 AND AS = " " THEN 
PRINT :COLUMN = 0: GOTO 170 

Column is a variable that keeps track of how many charac- 
ters we have printed on a line. Once it reaches 35 and we are 
close to the end of the line, we start looking for a blank. If A$ is 
equal to a space, then print jumps us to the beginning of the 



next line. We reset column to zero and then jump to the begin- 
ning of the statement again (if we didn't, we would start off 
printing the next line with a blank space) . 

This little input routine won't handle everything correctly. 
If you make a mistake and back up to correct it, column goes 
on incrementing with every character you type (including the 
left arrow) and you could print a very short-looking line. Or if 
you like to use very long words, it is entirely possible that you 
could type one in that was so long that it wrapped around to the 
next line despite our best efforts to prevent it. 

There is an easy way to handle the first objection, using a 
new Applesoft command: pos(x). The "x" is irrelevant — what 
is called a dummy variable. Let's edit line 170 one more time: 

170 GET A$:COLUMN = POS(0): IF. . . 

Pos(x) always returns a number from 0 to 39 that represents 
the current horizontal position of the cursor. Thus, if we back 
up, pos(0) will decrement, and column will always store an ap- 
propriate value. 

None of this is very useful if we can't store the information 
we are typing. What we need is to create a new string that will 
take each character as we type it in and add it to the previous 
ones ("string them all together" is what almost came out — and 
of course that's where the name came from). Then we can 
save the value of this new string on disk or cassette tape or 
send it to the printer. Let's make one more insertion to line 170 : 

170 GET A$:B$ = B$ + A$: COLUMN = 
POS(0). . . . 

B$ is an empty string. Every time we get a new value of A$ it 
gets added to the end of B$. The plus sign is not the same as an 
arithmetic plus, really (is A plus B equal to C?). A plus sign 
used with strings just means to add the second string to the end 
of the first one. So if A$ is equal to "Miss" and B$ equals "is- 
sippi" then A$ + B$ would equal "MISSISSIPPI". 
Let's add another line so we can test this: 



175 IF A$ = 



THEN PRINT: PRINT: PRINT B$: END

4 1 SO [HIT 



MAY 1982 



Here we use the @ symbol to indicate that we are finished typ- 
ing, at which point the computer will print a couple of spaces 
and then print the value of B$ and stop. With any luck B$ 
should closely resemble whatever gobbledygook you typed in 
before typing the @ sign. Of course, you will have word wrap- 
around since B$ is just being printed to the screen and not for- 
matted line by line. 

As you will quickly discover, however, B$ has some other 
limitations too — namely, that it can't be more than 255 charac- 
ters long. That is good enough for short notes and brief mem- 
oirs but will hardly do if you are trying to write the great 
American novel. What we need is some way to store a signifi- 
cant amount of text in memory. 

Wouldn't it be peachy if, just when B$ got all filled up, we 
could remove it to some safe place and start loading up a new 
string, called C$ (or some other such original name)? And 
then, when C$ filled up, couldn't we just put it away for safe- 
keeping too and pull out another empty variable, so that no 
matter how much we had to say, the Apple would patiently sit 
there tucking it away until we typed the fateful @? Yes in- 
deedy, that would be grand (I hear you say) . Enter the array. 

An array is a variable with a dimension. More precisely, it 
is a number of variables with the same name plus a subscript. 
A$(l) is a string variable just like A$. A$(2) is another string 
variable, as different from A$(l) as A$ may be from B$. 

The advantage of using a subscript to tell one string vari- 
able from the next is that you can insert a numerical variable 
in place of the number — A$(X). Then you can change string 
variables just by changing the value of X. Let's see how this 
can help us in our word processor program. 

Let's go back once again to faithful old line 170 and remove 
all references to B$, replacing them with the string variable 
text$(kount), thus: 

170 GET A$ ; TXT$(KOUNT) = 

TXT$(KOUNT) +; A$:COLUMN = POS(0) : 



IF COLUMN > 35 AND A$ = " " 
THEN PRINT :COLUMN = 0: GOTO 
170 

Then add the following two lines : 

175 IF LEN (TXTS(KOUNT)) > 254 THEN 
KOUNT = KOUNT + 1 

176 IF A$ = "@" THEN 200 

Line 175 checks the length of our string variable. If it is full 
(greater than 254 characters in length), then we increment 
kount by one, which causes us to start dumping our characters 
into the next string variable in the array. 

Line 176 jumps us out of the 170 to 180 loop once it recog- 
nizes the control character and sends us to line 200, which is 
the print routine: 

200 FOR X = 0 TO KOUNT 
210 PRINT TXT$(X) ; 
220 NEXT X: END 

This is a new kind of loop, called the for . . . next loop. Line 
200 says, "Set X equal to 0, then continue into the program un- 
til you reach the command next X. At that point, return to this 
line, add 1 to X and repeat the loop. Keep looping until X is 
equal to kount. At that point there is no next X, so the next time 
you hit next X, just keep on going." That's a lot to say with one 
little command, which is why this is considered one of the most 
powerful commands in Applesoft. 

To make effective use of this word processor, we still have 
to learn to dump this array out to a printer or at least onto disk 
or cassette. We will start getting into these matters (called I/O 
routines for input/output) in next month's column. 

Erratum. There was an error in last month's column. The 
last statement in line 110 of the program on page 27 should 
have read DAY = DAY - 1, instead of DAY = DAY + 1.

DISK PRICE 
BREAKTHROUGH 

Buy direct from the manufacturer and save 
on high-performance disk systems for Apple II. 



There's probably nothing that would add 
more power and usefulness to your Apple than 
a bigger, faster disk. 

Now Lobo Drives offers a whole family of 
disk upgrade options— direct from the manu- 
facturer, at substantial savings. 
We cut out the middleman — not the quality. 

Make no mistake— Lobo's low prices are 
for highest quality, ultra-reliable systems. We 
take no shortcuts in design, manufacturing, 
testing, and burn-in. That's why Lobo systems 
are probably the only ones you'll find anywhere 
with a 7 -year parts and labor guarantee. 

Lobo uses only Shugart or Seagate 
drives— the standards of the industry. We put 
them in rugged metal cabinets, with heavy-duty 
fan-cooled power supplies and our own proven 
controllers and interfaces. 

So whether you want 8" floppies, a 
Winchester system, or just a less expensive 
Apple-equivalent disk, Lobo delivers top quality 
for less. 

You'll find our disk price breakthrough 
can mean a real performance breakthrough for 
your Apple II! 




8" Floppy Disk Systems 

Up to 2.2 megabytes of on-line storage 
with two double-sided, double-density 8" flop- 
pies (1 .1 megabytes with single-sided drives). 
DOS 3.3 capabilities are supported. Interface 
plugs into any Apple I/O slot (except 0). 

Lobo's optional CP/M includes a special 
DENSITY command to permit reading and writ- 
ing standard single-density disks. 

Optional Pascal software lets you store the 
entire Apple Pascal system on one side of one 
8" disk— with lots of room left for program files. 

TWO SINGLE-SIDED DRIVES 

Model 8202CA $1625.00 
TWO DOUBLE-SIDED DRIVES 

Model 5202CA $2025.00 



Winchester Disk Systems 

Programs that make heavy use of disk 
files will get a spectacular performance boost 
when you plug in up to 8 megabytes of ultra- 
fast hard disk storage. And imagine the con- 
venience of having all your program and data 
files immediately available whenever you boot 
the sytem. 



IMPORTANT: many hard disk systems 
now being sold have no provision for backing 
up the disk (using standard Apple minifloppies, 
you'd need about three dozen diskettes to com- 
pletely back up a 5 MB drive!). Lobo hard disk 
systems come with a built-in double-sided, 
quad-density floppy drive that can store the 
complete contents of the hard disk on six or 
seven floppies. This floppy drive also adds the 
equivalent of at least 5 more Apple disk drives 
to your total on-line storage! 




5'/ 4 " SYSTEM: ONE 5MB HARD DISK PLUS 
ONE 737 kB FLOPPY 

Model 950A $3633.00 
8" SYSTEM: ONE 8 MB HARD DISK PLUS ONE 
1.2 MB FLOPPY 

Model 1850A $4459.00 
Both include Lobo DMA interface usable in 
Apple slot 1-7 and DOS 3.3 patches. CP/M 
optional (see below). 




Apple-Compatible Minifloppy Systems 

Both the disk drive and the interface 
card are functionally identical and plug- 
compatible with Apple Disk II equipment. Lobo 
and Apple drives may be freely mixed on a 
Lobo or Apple interface card, and the Lobo 
interface features a switch to select 13 or 16 
sector boot. The only other difference is the 
price and Lobo's unique 1-year guarantee! 
DISK DRIVE WITH INTERFACE CARD

Model 3101 $385.00 



Software and Accessories 

All Lobo disk systems come complete 
with interface card and any necessary patches 
to DOS 3.3. Use of Apple Pascal with Lobo 8" 
floppy drives requires the Lobo Pascal Creator 
disk and documentation. 

Running CP/M with Lobo Winchester 
or 8" floppy systems requires a Microsoft 
SoftCard, an Apple Language card (or Micro- 
soft RAM Card or equivalent), and the Lobo 
CP/M disk. Pascal is not currently supported on 
Lobo Winchester systems.

□ Following their move to larger quar- 
ters last month, Synergistic Software 
(Renton, WA) has hired Rebecca Clar- 
dy as production/shipping coordinator. 
Derek Dalton Oardy, age six months, 
will report to his immediate superiors, 
Ann and Robert Clardy, in the newly 
created position of executive vice presi- 
dent in charge of abusing diskettes and 
equipment to test their reliability. Derek 
brings nine months of related pre-natal 
experience to his new role. 

□ Linda Johnson, administrative vice 
president of Software Distributors (Cul- 
ver City, CA) has announced the forma- 
tion of a special software team to pro- 
vide support "in all aspects of software 
technical assistance" for their dealers. 
The team will deal with installation diffi- 
culties, defective disks, software bugs, 
disks configured for the incorrect hard- 
ware, and guidance in the proper use of 
the software. 

□ North America MICA (San Diego, CA) 
has initiated a dealer discount plan for its 
critical path project management and re- 
source management systems, PMS-II 
and RMS-II. Dealers will receive a 50 
percent discount of retail price for their 
first system, with subsequent discounts 
ranging from 20 to 65 percent. President 
Al Vanderpool announced the plan, say- 
ing, "We recognize that one of the big- 
gest impediments to marketing micro- 
computer software is the large invest- 
ment a dealer must make in multiple 
copies of a software package to get the 
higher discounts offered by most ven- 
dors. Our dealers can order the systems 
one at a time and still get the higher dis- 
count as the total number of systems they 
order grows." 

□ On- Line action: Teri and Ken Malinski 

are now with the Coarsegold, California, 
software firm as software acquisitions di- 
rector and assistant to the general man- 
ager, respectively. Ardie Lockman, in- 
ventor and computer hobbyist, is also 
supporting the general manager. Avis 
Durgan, who is engaged to programmer 
Jeff Stephenson, has been named prod- 
uct manager for the company's Screen- 
Writer II, working with the support team 
of Vickie Ryan and Linda Donathon. Ron 
Prusek is the new systems programmer, 
and Howard Luthy is now official hint 
giver for Time Zone and the rest of the 
HirRes Adventure series. 

In the marketing department, Bill 
Pearson is the new sales manager, bring- 
ing with him long experience in domes- 
tic and foreign sales and fluency in 
French, German, and Greek. Terry 
Pierce, one of On-Line's first employees, 



is now publications manager. 

In the executive sector, receptionists 
Diana Clark and Anona Labans have 
been appointed head of the purchasing 
department and chief of the order and 
shipping department, respectively. 
Laura Kushner is the new executive sec- 
retary and personnel manager, and 
Sharon Davison, wife of operations man- 
ager Rick Davison, has moved from pro- 
duction to a job in receivables. The Davi- 
sons are one of half a dozen husband-and- 
wife teams at On-Line: "We feel that 
their work gives a family-style spirit to 
the place," says marketing director John 
Williams. 

□ Automated Simulations (Mountain 
View, CA) has appointed Chet Franken- 
field as its new development manager. 
He will be responsible for the production 
and implementation of new products,

□ The Project Management Institute, a 
society for those practicing, consulting, 
or teaching in project management, is 
conducting a survey of project manage- 
ment software systems currently on the 
market, including scheduling packages, 
estimating, resource management, ma- 
terials control, equipment management, 
and cost control applicable to project- 
type work. Any service bureau, software 
vendors, or individuals who wish to have 
their packages included in the survey 
should contact Dr. Francis M. Webster,

□ Project SERAPHIM (Systems Engi- 
neering Respecting Acquisition and 
Propagation of Heuristic Instructional 
Materials) is being funded by the Na- 
tional Science Foundation to set up a 
model system for the dissemination of in- 
structional materials in chemistry. Us- 
ing microcomputer-based instructional 
modules, the program will set proce- 
dures for soliciting, evaluating, use-test- 
ing, publicizing, and disseminating in- 
structional modules, and will attempt to 
identify all persons involved. Modules 
will be tested in classrooms and labora- 
tories, and reviewed by users in the Jour- 
nal of Chemical Education. 

The project will also explore the feasi- 
bility of using a nationwide timesharing 
service as a medium for exchange of 
ideas about instructional programming 
and for transfer of programs to end 
users. The project would like to hear 
from any industrial chemists or engi- 
neers who have personal computers and 
are interested in writing programs that 
simulate on-the-job experiences. For in- 
formation, write to Dr. John W. Moore, 
visiting professor, Department of Chem- 
istry, University of Wisconsin at Madi- 
son, Madison, WI 53706; or call (608) 262-

Would You Buy a New Car 

Without 
Driving it First? 

I wouldn't! And I don't want to buy software I can't take a close look at 
either. 

That's the reason I've organized the FIRST LOOK COLLECTION for Apple* 
owners who have a disc drive. As a member you can make a 15% down payment 
on most software, and I'll let you evaluate it for three weeks. If you decide 
not to buy, just return the program; and your down payment will be my only 
service charge. 



I'll only send you programs 
you ask for. You never have 
to buy anything. But if you 
do decide to buy, I'll sell to 
members at low membership 
prices. 



cFirgt c Look^ 
Collection 



Also, I'm going to offer 
some special software bargains. 
For instance, I don't intend to 
send preview discs out over and over 
again until the oxide falls off. After a 
program has been previewed a few times, 
I'm going to sell it. 

My goal is to sell good software 
you've had a chance to take a close look 
at and you're satisfied with. I think the 
FIRST LOOK COLLECTION will stimulate 
the growth and development of high- 
quality software. 

I've talked to all the major publishers, 
and they are delighted to have us repre- 



sent them. I am stocking best- 
selling games, utilities, and 
high quality educational soft- 
ware designed for home use; 
but members will have a 
strong voice in the software 
we handle. So when you join, 
tell me the kinds of things 
you're interested in. 



In fact, list the three programs under 
$50 each you're most interested in and I'll 
let you preview two of them as part of your 
membership fee. The charter fee is only 
$45, so it's hard to lose. This membership 
fee will not only include a 15% down pay- 
ment on your first two selections, but it 
will get you my FIRST LOOK COLLECTION 
catalog chock-full of reviews and illustra- 
tions of the latest in software. 



yes, / want to join the FIRST LOOK COLLECTION! Piease 

send me a catalog and two of the three programs I've listed 
for preview.

ernment, industry, and business. 

□ Jerry Jewell, president of Sirius Soft- 
ware (Sacramento, CA) has announced 
the signing of the Grud to a lucrative en- 
dorsement contract as new company 
spokesman, catching many national ad- 
vertising agencies off-guard. The Grud 
has been approached many times in the 
past to support a variety of products, but 
has always refused. 

"I have my principles," stated the 
Grud at a recent press conference, "and I 
will not endorse a product I don't believe 
in. I am, however, very familiar with the 
Sirius product line and I'm very com- 
fortable recommending their computer 
games. 

"Also, they offered me more money 
than anyone else." 

□ In response to hundreds of inquiries 
worldwide, Barry Passen has decided to 
move up franchising plans for Microcon 
SoftwareCenters (Watertown, MA). 
They have retained Franchise Develop- 
ment Corporation of Concord, New 
Hampshire, to coordinate all franchising ef- 
forts of the consulting/program- 
ming/hardware selection service soft- 
ware retailing concept. Current plans are 
to place Business SoftwareCenters, 
which will also provide information and 
service hotlines, in major population cen- 
ters and surround them with a cluster of 
Family SoftwareCenters in suburban 
mall settings, offering off-the-shelf en- 
tertainment and educational software 
and limited demonstration facilities. In- 
dividuals wishing franchise information 
should contact Franchise Development 
Corporation, (603) 746-4877. 

□ Rothchild Consultants has announced 
publication of the Optical Memory News- 
letter, covering all but the consumer en- 
tertainment applications of laser video- 
disc technology, including microcomput- 
er interfaces, image storage and re- 
trieval, as well as direct read-write digi- 
tal computer mass storage and office au- 
tomation systems. Said company presi- 
dent Edward S. Rothchild, "Optical 
Memory Newsletter will strive to be- 
come a trusted clearinghouse of infor- 
mation" for vendors and users of mag- 
netic computer peripherals, microfilm, 
microfiche, lasers, optics, and software. 

□ Micro Focus (Santa Clara, CA) and 
Digital Research (Pacific Grove, CA) 
have signed an agreement to share mar- 
keting and distribution rights for CIS Co- 
bol and Level II Cobol. Digital Research 
is to market the languages for 8-bit 8080- 
based and 16-bit 8086 or 8088 based mi- 
cros running on any of the CP/M-generic 
operating systems, to OEMs, ISVs, deal- 
ers, and distributors. Micro Focus will 
continue to handle customization of the 
Cobols to other operating systems, and 
sales of its software construction and 
maintenance tools. Sales and marketing 
of their CP/M-compatible product line 
will gradually be handed over to Digital 



Research. 

"We started in business about the 
same time as Gary Kildall and Dorothy 
McEwen of Digital Research," said Mi- 
cro Focus president Brian Reynolds, 
"and both companies have grown at 
about the same rate and now have very 
similar organizations. Our people are of a 
similar age and outlook and we feel that 
the two companies can work very well 
together." 

"This is a unique opportunity to bring 
the microcomputer and personal com- 
puter up to the standard of commercial 
systems technology set in the past by 
mainframes," said John Rowley, Digital 
Research chief operating officer. 

□ Lifeboat Associates (New York, NY) 
has doubled the size of its new products 
department to assure authors of prompt 
technical evaluation for their software, 
contractual negotiations, and other soft- 
ware author requirements. They are also 
distributing the publication "Guideline 
for Software Authors." 

□ Applied Software Technology (Monte 
Sereno, CA) has signed Rainbow Sys- 
tems and Sales (Bellevue, WA) and 
PCMA (Los Angeles, CA), both manu- 
facturer's representatives for Apple 
Computer, as regional sales representa- 
tives for AST's VersaForm business 
form processor in the Pacific Northwest 
and Pacific Southwest. Apple III ver- 
sions of VersaForm are currently in fi- 
nal beta test, and will be formally an- 
nounced in the next two months. 

□ Arthur Young and Company (San 
Jose, CA), one of the Big Eight national 
accounting firms, has developed Audit- 
Computer, a new audit tool for examin- 
ing its clients' EDP records, utilizing an 
Apple III. Chris Veal, speaking at the 
Management Science America FU- 
TURE conference in San Francisco, out- 
lined the system's ability to consolidate 
up to six manual audit functions, en- 
abling an auditor with computer knowl- 
edge to review the computer audit for ac- 
curacy, tie in with the manual audit, and 
examine and test client records. The sys- 
tem can access client data over phone 
lines, connect directly to the client's com- 
puter, or read data files off an IBM 3740 
diskette. The Apple III serves as the sys- 
tem's central processing and control 
unit, along with an Altos to read IBM 
floppies, a 20Mb hard disk drive, and a 
dot matrix printer. Arthur Young has en- 
hanced audit effectiveness by develop- 
ing general and customized audit soft- 
ware for the single standardized system. 

□ The Programmers, Inc. of Taos, New 
Mexico, has purchased The Eureka 
Learning System, designed to give edu- 
cators the use of an Apple personal com- 
puter without having to learn program- 
ming, from Eiconics, the developers of 
the courseware generator. Staffing and 
support plans are underway, and licens- 
ing negotiations are ongoing with IBM 
and Zenith to market a CP/M version of 
the system.

Lutheran Social Servants 
Swear by ZARDAX 



BV JOHATHAM MILLER 

One hundred and fifty miles west of 
the Tri-Cities of Pasco, Kennewick, and 
Richland, in southwestern Washington 
state, a feathery plume of steam rises 
from Mount Saint Helens. Washing- 
ton's celebrated volcano appears to be 
ouieting down after a weekend tan- 
trum, but the moody mountain's rest- 
lessness only adds to the general uncer- 



tainty in an area whose economy has 
gone awry. Those who were here in May 
1980 still remember the day the snow- 
capped giant defied predictions and blew 
its tapered top, transforming the heav- 
ens of the Pacific Northwest into an ash- 
en vision of the Apocalypse. 

Dan Haygeman, southeast area di- 
rector for Lutheran Social Services in 
Kennewick, was among them. "It was 
probably the weirdest sky I'd ever seen," 



says the man who now contends with the 
family and psychological effects of the 
economic fallout. "It was like giant roses 
opening up, with big handfuls of ash drop- 
ping down through the clouds. We got 
only a light dusting here, but, as close as 
ten miles north, there was no traffic for 
weeks — engines ground up, just totally 
destroyed. It was a major economic thing 
for a lot of farm folks and still is to some 
extent."

News accounts that compared the 
mighty blast to the relatively puny force 
of the first atomic bombs wer.e not lost on 
Tri-Citians. The plutonium for the bomb 
dropped oh Nagasaki during World War 
II was processed at the Hanford Federal. 
Nuclear Reservation in Richland, now 
home to a major nuclear development at 
the confluence of the Columbia and 
Snake rivers. 

Harnessing nature's awesome power 
has been this area's historic link with the 
land. Before the bomb, there was the 
river — federal hydroelectric projects 
that tamed the Columbia and helped turn 
the vast temperate river basin from a 
desert into an irrigated oasis supporting 
wheat, potatoes, grapes, and apple or- 
chards. When Uncle Sam began to phase 
out the Hanford facility in the mid-1960s 
(plutonium stocks were adequate and a 
newer plant had been built in Georgia) , 
Tri-City leaders lobbied to give it a new 
lease on life. At that time, Hanford ac- 
counted for 70 percent of the area's pay- 
roll. Take away Hanford, they said, and 
all you'd have was but a big river. 

Bailing Out Buck Rogers. In the en- 
suing years, billions of federal dollars 
poured into the area to support a variety 
of high technology projects, including re- 
search on breeder reactors and perma- 
nent nuclear waste disposal. (Most of the 
nation's nuclear waste is in temporary 
storage at Hanford.) By 1980, civic lead- 
ers were openly dreaming of the twenty- 
first century, of a twenty-unit nuclear 
park that would provide electricity for 
the entire Northwest. Three reactors 
were already being developed under the 
aegis of the Washington Public Power 
Supply System and two more were in the 
offing. The Tri-City population, a pid- 
dling four thousand in the 1940s, had bal- 
looned to 130,000 and the signs of growth 
were everywhere: new shopping cen- 
ters, fast-food restaurants, and trailer 
parks jammed with new arrivals. 

"Nuclear butters the bread of a lot of 
people," a local labor economist told the 
Wall Street Journal and the statistics 
bear him out: 20,000 of the area's 74,000- 
person work force are directly employed 
by the nuclear industry and Tri-Citians 
are proud of it. When consumer activist 
Ralph Nader blew into town in 1979 (the 
year of Three Mile Island) , he was greet- 
ed by a throng of 1,020— twenty support- 
ers and a thousand jeering pronuclear 
demonstrators. 

Tri-City residents, as far as Hayge- 
man can discern, still support nuclear 
power, but the industry itself has fallen 
on hard times, particularly in Washing- 
ton, a state whose economic fortunes 
have long followed the ups and downs of 
the volatile aerospace and wood product 
industries. Management miscalcula- 
tions about electric demand, six fold cost 
overruns and construction, labor, and 
regulatory snafus have forced the Wash- 
ington Public Power Supply System, 
known locally as Whoops, to abandon one 



of the Tri-City plants. There are rumors 
of further cutbacks, says Haygeman, and 
a creeping sense of insecurity that is 
spilling over into his bailiwick, the fam- 
ily setting. 

Off Off Broadway. "This community 
has a hefty divorce population, because 
the Ph.Ds and engineer types are caught 
up in this nuclear thing," he explains. 
"They feel they've got to make it work 
and they just moved to town from an- 
other new project and their spouses are 
unhappy because they were living in New 
York and could go to the theater and now 
they're out here and, quote, there's noth- 
ing to do. There's a lot to do, but it's not 
just paying $15 for a ticket. You have to 
be creative and curious." 

Being creative and curious is also the 
watchword for social service adminis- 
trators like Haygeman.who is particu- 
larly proud of his office's in-home and in- 
tensive counseling programs for fami- 
lies and individuals. He has seen his 
agency budget shrink by a third and is 
bracing for further reductions as legisla- 
tors attempt to balance the state's 
ledgers. Add to that a nationwide reces- 
sion and massive cutbacks in social wel- 
fare, housing, and food programs and 
you have the classic Catch 22 for a charit- 
able organization: shrinking resources 
coupled with a greater demand for ser- 
vices. 



"We've been called more times on 
emergencies in the last few months than 
in the past year and a half," says Hayge- 
man, who adds, "when times are tight, 
everybody's tight, and that means 
they're also tight in their giving." 

Resource problems of this magnitude 
demand inspired solutions — creative ap- 
proaches to fund-raising, budget-balanc- 
ing, and counseling. Even when the force 
is with you, you have to harness its 
power. And in the technological eighties, 
that means one thing. You buy an Apple 
and, like any good soldier, you get with 
the program— in accounting, data man- 
agement, and word processing. 

Shall We Dance. Necessity invents, 
Apples circumvent. 

It is 1981 and Haygeman and his pro- 
gram supervisor Tom Anderson are 
steeling themselves to the annual ordeal, 
the budget. They're looking at a moun- 
tain of paper and hoping it's not a vol- 
cano about ready to erupt. Tomorrow 
they submit their proposed budget to 
United Way, which provides roughly 15 
percent of their support. And guess 
what? Two mistakes and a $5,000 imbal- 
ance that throws everything off, yet 
somehow, even at the eleventh hour, they 
work around it. Then the other shoe 
drops. 

While waiting for word on their United 
Way allocation, the state informs them

THE 

CONSOLIDATOR 

FOR VISICALC FILES 



NOW YOU CAN USE ALL THE 
POWER OF YOUR APPLE AND 
ALL THE POWER OF YOUR ViSlCALC. 



If you use VisiCalc, you must have The 
Consolidator. It's that simple. The Consolidator 
will save you hours of Keyboard time — adding 
any number of VisiCalc files together, virtually 
automatically. 

F'or example, say you need to add the results of 
four weekly reports to get the monthly total— 
or add three months for the quarter, 
twelve for the year, etc. Until now, 
you had to key-in all the 
individual sub-totals and 
recalculate. Now, The 
Consolidator will do it 
for you. 

T he Consolidator 
will also print 
out VisiCalc commands, 
formulas, and the locations 
to which they apply. In 
the past, programs that 
did ONLY that have sold 
for as much as The 
Consolidator alone. 



The Consolidator is easy to use, with prompts, 
options and formats all carefully spelled out. If 
you can use VisiCalc, you can use The Consolidator. 
It will handle all the column widths, rows and 
columns accommodated by VisiCalc. It will handle 
any matrix size which you are able to save with 
VisiCalc. And it will give you back hours of 
manual calculation and keying time. 

ou need The Consolidator 
to use ALL the power you've 
got with VisiCalc. It's a bargain 
at the introductory 
price of just $49.95, at 
your local dealer 
or direct. Visa and 
Mastercard holders

they are eliminating funding for their 
$110,000 Voluntary Shelter Care pro- 
gram. "Suddenly, from being a $300,000 
area office, we're a $200,000 office, less 
all the indirect costs that program was 
carrying for management, rent, arid 
phone. Now, you're already exhausted 
from this budget process, which you have 
to psych yourself up for year after year, 
and now everything is so out of whack, 
you couldn't plug it with a truck." 

Haygeman is beside himself. No, he's 
talking to himself. "You've got to be 
kidding. We're not going to be doing this 
again. All it is is erase, erase, erase." 
And then the bell rings, the light goes off 
as the inspiration forms: Haygeman 
Wants An Apple. 

This is not a revolutionary idea in it- 
self, though Haygeman freely admits he 
doesn't know the difference between 
PROM and a three-pronged plug. Com- 
puters are a part of everyday business 
life, so he appeals to his agency's home 
office in Seattle. With an Apple and a few 
programs, he can revise budgets instant- 
ly, gather caseload and workload data to 
increase efficiency, and even more ex- 
citing, perhaps even use it as a diagnos- 
tic tool through games and self-adminis- 
tered tests. "We aren't making decisions 
on how we ought to spend our money or 
allocate resources," he argues. "We're 
just trying to make these numbers bal- 
ance out." 

The home office is not altogether un- 
sympathetic to the general idea. They're 
quite satisfied with the churchwide com- 
puterized data service they're tied into 
back in Minneapolis ; they just can't find 
any money in their budget for area office 
microcomputers . 

Apples and Angels. No money in the 
state budget, none in his, and no angel to 
get a computer show on the road. At 
times like these, a man must look deep 
within himself — then dig even deeper. 
"This office got picked to be a pilot Ap- 
ple program," says Haygeman matter- 
of-factly, "because several employees 
and a couple of people in the community 
were willing to pledge x amount of dol- 
lars to make the lease payment on a com- 
puter." 

The phrasing's formal but the modest 
intent is clear. Heeding the Biblical in- 
junction, Haygeman, Anderson, and fel- 
low employees have helped themselves. 
They've gone for it, a comprehensive 
package including an Apple II-Plus, a 
language card, a Videx card, an NEC 
5510 Spin Writer, a thirteen-sector Visi- 
Calc, and last (though not finally) an 
Easy Writer word processor, soon to be 
superseded by Zardax. 

Now all they have to do is figure how 
to use the stuff and what better way to be- 
gin than by revising the budget. So back 
to the drawing board they go, only this 
time the board's the Apple's CRT, its 
screen greasing over with finger marks 
as, bleary-eyed, they haggle into the 
night item by item. 




Tom Anderson videotapes a counseling session through 
a two-way mirror. Clients are fully aware they are be- 
ing filmed, and the tapes serve several purposes: The so- 
cial workers can study body language and other visual 
factors that might help them to better understand the 
clients; if they have a particularly vexing case they can 
show the tape to an outside professional for advice; 
also, periodically, they have a team of professional psy- 
chologists evaluate their counseling techniques. 

"It was a real pain," recalls Ander- 
son. "Essentially, we were learning to 
use the computer at the same time we 
were learning VisiCalc and at the same 
time doing the budget ; but then this year 
when we revised it again, we already had 
the base of it, and that's the real power 
for us." 

Computer people talk a lot about 



power, that synergy of speed and mem- 
ory which is supposed to enhance their 
control of the environment. VisiCalc had 
given Haygeman and Anderson the 
power to manipulate office data, but the 
complete system envisioned by them also 
called for the manipulation of words. 
Writing grant proposals in an era of di- 
minished resources is a major undertak- 
ing, and revising them can be as time- 
consuming as budget balancing. 

Cursoring the Darkness. "The ability 
to move whole blocks of paragraphs 
around gives a lot of flexibility in being 
able to customize proposals," explains 
Anderson, as he and Haygeman ("I 
sound like a salesman for Zardax and I 
only bought one") rave about their new- 
est program acquisition. "With the Easy 
Writer program we used in the past," in- 
terjects Haygeman, "if you wanted to 
move a paragraph, you had to load it, 
mark it, and load in the buffer, which 
limited the amount you could move. With 
Zardax you get the cursor to the para- 
graph you want moved and that's it." 

Speed and ease of use — Zardax docu- 
mentation is a model of clear writing in 
plain English — recommend the menu- 
driven program, but it also has one other 
virtue, they say: compatibility both with 
friendly humans and other programs. 
"Tom spends a lot of time on writing, but 
because it's fun, he gets to it and does it,"

Haygeman explains. "And I don't think I 
would spend all day Sunday writing new 
job descriptions on a regular typewriter. 
I did enough of that in grad school." 

Zardax has been married to Hayge- 
man's mail list program and, in what 
promises to be a major application, may 
soon be integrated into a data manage- 
ment program being designed by a pro- 
grammer with the Tri-City-based Bat- 
telle Memorial Research Institute. 

"We want a program that will tell us 
where our clients are coming from, who's 
seeing them, how they're doing," says 
Haygeman. "These are the things we 
desperately need to do, like client follow- 
ups. If you send out questionnaires to 
clients you probably won't get many re- 
plies, but maybe with a letter we'd have a 
better chance. If we can interface Zar- 
dax with the Battelle project, we can get 
that letter out automatically rather than 
using a staff person or volunteer." 

Count Your Karma. Word processing 
and budget programs can make an of- 
fice manager's life easier, but an Apple 
can also double as a diagnostic tool. Hay- 
geman and company are looking into 
programs that would enable clients in- 
volved in family-oriented services to self- 
administer psychological tests. They have 
already had some success using the Syn- 
ergistic Software Odyssey adventure 
game as a therapeutic device. Anderson 
relates the story of an adopted fourteen- 
year-old boy who was not communicat- 
ing with his parents. 

"The patterns of interaction came out 
when playing the game. Whenever he 
came to a choice point, he'd want to sit 
back and wait cautiously or approach 
friendlily. The positive dialogue he would 
carry on was, 'I don't want to do any- 
thing wrong right here.' His cautious- 
ness about saying anything or making 
any kind of movement in the family was 
coming through in his playing of the 
game." 

Haygeman believes games have 
value both as distractions (youngsters 
are more approachable when they're ab- 
sorbed in them) and as moral teachers. 
"The game keeps track of your karma. It 
makes sure that if you're really evil and 
wicked, you run into a lot of like-minded 
people who are going to surprise you and 
turn out to be bandits." 

Haygeman's eagerness to apply tech- 
nology to social service work — the 
Lutheran Center also employs videotape 
to monitor client behavior and counselor 
techniques— has raised a few conserva- 
tive eyebrows in the statewide agency. In 
fact, it has even earned Haygeman the 
dubious dubbing of "Mr. Toys," a sobri- 
quet he suffers with wincing good grace, 
since both he and Anderson are secure in 
the knowledge that they're getting on 
with the agenda of the eighties. "Only 
those agencies that are able to offer a 
product that people will buy," says An- 
derson, "will survive when resources are 
limited. The kinds of tools we can offer

duce office manager Bette Christiansen to the Zardax 
system. 



people — not as a game but in terms of be- 
ing professional — enhance our credibil- 
ity as an agency." 

Hustling Hope. Haygeman likes do- 
ing a job well, which means neatly, logi- 
cally and efficiently. It was that organiz- 



85 



ing impulse that drew him to computers 
in the first place, though his world is any- 
thing but neat. "My work has helped me 
deal with some of my problems," he con- 
fides. "It keeps forcing me to confront 
some of my overly idealistic ways of 
thinking — of dealing with the difficulty of 
what's possible and what's desirable, as 
in my own life, where I have always 
wanted things better than they are." 

When you counsel individuals and 
families in crisis, as he and Anderson do, 
you come to distrust easy answers. You 
recognize the built-in limits of the situa- 
tion and concentrate on the overriding is- 
sue that is causing the pain. "The pro- 
gram here is not designed to wrap every- 
thing up nice and neat, because most of 
the families we see have multiple kinds 
of problems. All we're trying to do is get 
them back on track, to focus on the prob- 
lem. Can it be solved or can they learn to 
live with it? In a time of shrinking re- 
sources, you have to focus more on alle- 
viating the suffering than on enhance- 
ments." 

A lingering recession and state and 
federal budget cuts are likely to aggra- 
vate suffering, but they provide agencies 
like Haygeman's with an opportunity: to 
do more with less. And that, adds Hayge- 
man, is a challenge they take in stride.

Waltz in 1:37 3 k Tim 





Trainer Darrell Vienna 
Keeps Records on an Apple 

BY ROSS HEWHAH 



It is six a.m. and the morning mist envelopes Santa Anita 
racetrack, obscuring the San Gabriel Mountains. It is cold and 
wet, but the work goes on, horses and people suddenly emerg- 
ing, then disappearing again in the ethereal fog. 

The city of Arcadia sleeps, but in the city within a city, in 
the Santa Anita stable area and on the track itself, the beat 
goes on — regardless of weather, regardless of the early hour. 

It is in the morning, in fact, that the most important work is 
done. Long before the first bet is placed, before the first call to 
post, the stable is alive with activity. 

Finely tuned Thoroughbreds are led to the track for work- 
outs of varying distances. Young colts and fillies are schooled 
in the starting gate and paddock. Grooms muck out stalls. Hot 
walkers bathe the panting horses as they return from the 
track, then cool them off by leading them in a circle for twenty 
minutes. Trainers move between their barn offices and the 
stretch turn, the place they call docker's corner. Jockey 
agents dog their footsteps, talking in whispers, hoping to book 
their client on a hot horse. 

The routine goes on daily, changing not as much as the peo- 
ple who practice it. 

A Horse of a Different Color. Some still picture a horse 
trainer as a prairie hardboot, a pinch of snuff in his lip, stubble 
on his cheeks, a lariat hanging from his belt and a crumbled 



note pad about to fall from his hip pocket. 

Now, however, with inflation and industry growth driving 
purses to impressive heights, with the value of horses at aston- 
ishing levels, the training of Thoroughbreds is being done by a 
wide variety of men and women — some trained on the job, 
some more formally, some who wear three-piece suits to the 
afternoon races and some who remain in mud-calked boots 
and jeans. 

Typical of those who embrace both the old and new is Dar- 
rell Vienna, a thirty-five-year-old University of California at 
Los Angeles psychology graduate who was a one-man rodeo 
team while at Westwood, now takes extension courses in poet- 
ry and creative writing, founded (as an undergraduate) and 
remains part owner of a pharmaceutical company specializ- 
ing in nutritional products for large animals (from horses to 
whales), occasionally ruffles the conservative racing estab- 
lishment as an outspoken advocate of horsemen's rights, and 
had purse winnings of about one and a quarter million dollars 
last year, only five years after receiving his trainer's license. 

Vienna talks about a "vanguard of younger trainers" who 
aren't afraid to employ their only weapon— the withholding of 
entries— in disputes with the state racing board and track 
management. And he also talks about his affection for and 
comfort with the "older form of life" on the track backstretch,

a community where "respect for ethics and people" repre- 
sents a less cynical, less harried era. 

The (Apple) Cart before the Horse. As a product of both 
pragmatic and formal education, Vienna believes a Thorough- 
bred trainer must combine perseverance with "open-minded 
creativity." He is in the forefront of stable creativity, a pio- 
neer of sorts since he has brought space age technology to the 
muck and mire of the stable, housing an Apple II computer 
costing about twenty-five hundred dollars in a battered roll-top 
desk, the most attractive piece of furniture in his barn office. 

Vienna believes the computers (he also has one in his Ar- 
cadia home) contribute to his racing success by streamlining 
his operation, and he predicts that his success will soon lead to 
the appearance of computers in other barns. 

"Every stable runs on small details," Vienna said, sitting 
behind the desk. "Those details mount up and inevitably be- 
come forgotten. You lose a scrap of paper or simply forget to 
do something because you have so much else on your mind. 

"The computer makes us more efficient. I mean, any time 
you're not missing something that someone else is, you've got

an edge, though a stable's success still depends on the type of 
people working for you." 

Throwing the Bull — for Profit. Vienna arrived at his views 
after studying horses "from many different aspects" — the first 
as a Glendale youth who found work and recreation in the 
river-bottom stables near Griffith Park, generating an inter- 
est that flowered at Burbank High, where he began attending 
and participating in rodeos. 

A success at that level, Vienna sought a college that offered 
rodeo as the fourth R. He attended the University of San Fran- 
cisco briefly, transferred to Pierce College, then became 
UCLA's one-man representative to competitions sponsored by 
the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association, the only col- 
lege competitions in which the participants collect more than 
the thrill of victory and agony of defeat. 

Competing primarily in bronco and bull riding, Vienna said 
he made between four thousand and eight thousand dollars a 
year, operating in a practical laboratory that allowed him to 
apply some of the lessons received as a psychology major spe- 
cializing in animal learning. 

"To me," Vienna said, "most of psychology is nothing more 
than mumbo jumbo, not much different from religion. 

"With animal learning, you can at least apply a degree of 
science, a degree of testability, which is all we're really doing 
as trainers, though at that time I wasn't thinking of becoming 
one." 

While a senior at UCLA, Vienna's education reached a 
more refined and sophisticated level with his 1970 marriage to 
the former Kristen Anderson, whose family was involved with 
show horses and hunters, providing Vienna with yet another 
aspect of equine handling and a future emblem for his racing 
stable, the hunted fox. 

From Bromide to Barn. The marriage also led to the estab- 
lishment of Vienna's pharmaceutical company, the outgrowth 
of conversations with Kristen's father in which differing opin- 
ions on animal nutrition led to a decision to test their respec- 
tive views commercially. 

Spectrum Media has been a continuous success, according 
to Vienna, who was involved full-time in its operation until 1976, 
when he was asked by a friend who had personal problems to 
take over the training of his one-horse stable. 

Temporary became permanent and Vienna, while still look- 
ing for the handicap star all trainers dream about, now has six- 
ty-nine horses in training at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park, 
and up to twice that many — some of which he is part owner and 
others having been entrusted to his care — at breeding farms 
and training centers. 

The rapid growth prompted Vienna to purchase a home 
computer for billing purposes (son Christopher, age three, has 
a tough time distinguishing it from his own electronic toys) , 
and Vienna soon enlarged its purpose and value by program- 
ming in records of Lexington's Bloodstock Research Agency. 
Now, for reasons either of breeding, claiming, or purchase, 
Vienna has the pedigrees of virtually every registered Thor- 
oughbred at his fingertips. -'JV "

fied by the savings in cost and time, Vienna then purchased a

tion, menu-driven database (he has had no formal training in 
computer use) in which to store what he estimates is the 
equivalent of one hundred typewritten pages of information on 
his sixty-nine horses now in training. 

Vienna and staff still keep written records, but there seems 
to be no question as to the computer's edge in speed and effi- 
ciency. 

It took Vienna only about two minutes, for instance, to call 
up a printout of the worming records (date, type, name of vet) 
on all sixty-nine horses. He estimated that it would take more 
than an hour to compile the material sorting through a note- 
book. 

Assistant trainer Phil Hronec and foreman Howard Baker 
do most of the updating and revising. "I've worked in several 
barns," Baker said, "and I just wish they'd all had a comput- 
er. It makes everything a lot easier." 

Vienna's computer houses veterinary, equipment, and race 



records that can be summoned on one or all of the sixty-nine 
horses. A code prevents anyone unfamiliar with its operation 
from stealing the material. The operator has the option of re- 
ceiving material via printout or television screen. And Vienna 
insists it's all very easy to move when he shifts his operation to 
Hollywood Park and Del Mar in seasonal pursuit of the Thor- 
oughbreds. 

Obviously, there are more sophisticated examples of the 
computer age, but not in the Santa Anita stable area. And 
while it has not turned the long and often difficult days into a 
Vienna waltz, the trainer in Barn 86 believes others in his con- 
servative business will soon be joining him at a keyboard.

Horses 
Don't Take 
Weekends Off 




BV HARCOT (OtlSTOCK TOMHERVIk 

His workday starts at five a.m. because that's when the 
horses start to stir. He greets them, feeds them, sees to their 
health; he attends to the logistics of the morning workouts, 
training for some, timed works for others, simple gallops for 
others. After the workouts the horses must be walked to cool 
down, bathed, scoped, rubbed, curried, and generally loved. 
He's responsible for all of it. 

By ten a.m. he's done, and he runs home for a shower, only 
to return an hour later to ready the entries for the day's races. 
When all is in order, he has time to work. This work is the busi- 
ness — seeing to supplies, bills owed and owing, arrange- 
ments with suppliers like the farrier, the person who keeps the 



horses shod; the feed suppliers; and the veterinarians, who 
visit the horses daily. 

Somewhere around six p.m., the day's races end and, after 
one last round of the stables, Phil Hronec can go home. 

But you can be sure he'll be back come five o'clock tomor- 
row morning, regardless of the day of the week. Because 
horses don't take weekends. 

Horses before Kindergarten. When Phil Hronec was five 
years old, his father bought a horse. It was not Hronec 's in- 
troduction to horses; his dad was an official for Hollywood 
Park in Lqs Angeles for twenty years. But it heralded the be- 
ginning of a new era of his life, for pretty soon his dad had ac- 
quired several horses and he took Phil with him as he and the 
horses did the rounds of Northern California's fairgrounds in 
the summers. 

Phil had been around the tracks so much that when he 
started galloping horses in the mornings at the age of fourteen

no one thought anything of it. He wasn't green; it seemed 
natural. If anyone noticed that the legal age was sixteen and 
that Phil was on the wrong side of it, they weren't talking. 

Soon Phil was riding workouts and training races and his 
lifelong dream of being a jockey grew more and more real. As 
it grew, however, so did Phil, and suddenly the dream was 
shattered. Hronec, who's less than average height, has a 
strong build; it wasn't his height that was the problem, but his 
frame. Diets, diuretics, all the tricks jockeys use to keep their 
weight down could only harm Hronec, and they didn't work 
anyway. 

Hronec had just had time to deal with his disappointment 
and begin thinking about training when Uncle Sam called. It 
was 1968 and men were needed in Vietnam. Immediately, Phil 
requested duty with the cavalry; but there is no cavalry 
anymore. 

In the end, the army recognized Hronec's lifestyle: he got 
out eighty days early due to "seasonal occupation" — Holly- 
wood Park was opening. 

Hronec went back to daily gallops and joined the California 
Horse Racing Board; during that summer he took his orals be- 
fore the stewards and won his training license. 

Signs of Things To Come? The first horse Trainer Hronec 
saddled, named Makanski, won. The race was on the fair cir- 
cuit, and while Hronec had some success training others' 
horses, it wasn't the answer for him. He came back to Los 
Angeles and landed a job with Darrell Vienna, training horses 
at the offtrack; Hronec was working with second-string horses 
at Hollywood Park when the meeting was at Santa Anita, and 
vice versa. 

When an offer came through for a private job in Arizona, 
Hronec took it ; a year later, it fell through and things began 
looking down. Just when it seemed something had to give, Vi- 
enna called; he wanted Hronec back, this time as his right- 
hand man. 

That was a year ago. Vienna is worried about the hours and 



the pace required of a man in Hronec's job. But Phil isn't con- 
cerned. 

"Darrell makes it okay," Hronec says. "He's a good man, a 
good trainer, and a good person to work for. 

"The hours are long, but they're necessary. I love working 
with good horses. But I wouldn't want to train again on a small 
basis. You've got to affiliate with people with money, or you're 
nowhere. 

"I enjoy the way it is. I'll stick with Darrell." 

Apple in the Ointment. One of Hronec's responsibilities is 
seeing that each horse gets its proper medication at proper 
times. Another is running the Apple. The latter makes the 
former a whole lot easier. 

Vienna wrote all the programs for the stables. Every 
horse's day-to-day medical history is only one of many bits of 
information you can evoke with a keystroke. Also available is 
the racing history of each horse, training and workout rec- 
ords. Other programs keep track of the stable's accounts, and 
Phil uses these regularly too. 

Phil and associate Howard Baker input all the data, but it's 
worth it. 

"The Apple saves us huge amounts of time, and keeping 
track of everything is so much easier," Phil says, which is say- 
ing a lot from someone as busy as Phil. 

Busy? There were paddles hooked up. 

"What do you think we do all afternoon during the races?" 
barks Hronec. "We have to play sometimes!" 

But»not a whole lot. Their repertoire of entertainment soft- 
ware consists of the Apple master disk and one of Apple's old 
contributed disks. Hronec and Baker content themselves with 
Starwars, Sink the Ship and Yahtzee. 

You might think that Phil Hronec has found a new love, sec- 
ond only to the Thoroughbreds. 

"I think everyone should have an Apple," Phil says. 

Horses and Apples. It's always been a winning 
combination. 31

contemplating 

a byte 

Robots are here and they are changing the world we live in. From bulky industrial 
welders to fantastically complex planetary probes, robots are sure to make our lives a little 
easier. Robots will get much more sophisticated in the decades to come ; by the next cen- 
tury they may be our model citizens. 

But will robots be immune from the human weaknesses that usually attend a high level 
of intelligence? On the cover of our August 1981 issue we fantasized what a humanoid robot 
may look like in the future. We also gave this highly developed mechanical man the hard- 
est task we could devise — contemplating an object and its significance. 

Will robots ever be able to sit and think about something that Is not directly related to 
performing a task? 

Softalk can't answer that question for you, but we can help you contemplate the un- 
known future in a special way. We commissioned graphics artist Robert Zralck to do 
August's cover with a poster in mind. The robot contemplating a bite is evocative both of 
Rodin's The Thinker and the Genesis passage on the Garden of Eden . . . not to mention the 
possible significance to our favorite technological fruit. 

The artist and Softalk are sharing in the profits from the poster. Softalk will distribute 
its proceeds to individuals developing Apple tools to help the handicapped. Softalk guaran- 
tees 100 percent distribution of its monies. 

In addition to the posters, which are sold at $6.00 (plus $1.50 to cover shipping and han- 
dling) , some of the two hundred artist's proofs, signed by Robert Zraick, are still available 
at $75 each. 

The size of the poster is 24 inches by 34 inches. The artist's proofs are hand-numbered and 
hand-signed, and each is accompanied by a certificate giving its number and guarantee- 
ing that only 200 are being distributed. 

Robert Zraick's art will grace any computer room, and your purchase will help others 
become more self-sufficient.

□ Mickey Micro. The big summer movie 
from Walt Disney Productions this year 
is Tron, in which a game programmer 
gets his expertise put to the ultimate test 
when he is blasted into a video game mi- 
cro-dimension by an evil Master Control 
Program. He must then recruit the high- 
tech inhabitants of the realm to seek out 
and destroy the MCP. 

Several computer graphics houses 
have labored on the effects since July 
1981 to have the film ready for its release 
July 9, and in all likelihood they're still 
doing so as you read this. The film is set 



based computer, Dataticket offers sev- 
eral different features that benefit the 
theater owner and moviegoer alike. 

For the impatient film lover, who ab- 
hors waiting in line to buy a ticket, Data- 
ticket allows for the advance sale of tick- 
ets. Much like a ticket machine in an air- 
port, Dataticket prints out the actual tick- 
ets at the time of purchase. Needless to 
say, getting your tickets in advance on a 
general seating basis will not help much 
if the film is enjoying some degree of 
popularity. Getting a good seat with a 
clear view of the screen will still necessi- 




David Warner as the Master Control Program's henchman in "Tron." 



in a world made entirely of computer- 
generated imagery, one frame of which 
can require up to seventy-five million 
computer calculations to create. (One 
minute of film is composed of 1,240 
frames.) 

Bally, the nation's largest arcade 
game manufacturer, has created a Tron 
video game for its 240 Aladdin's Castle 
arcades as well as theaters that will be 
exhibiting the film. The finals of the na- 
tional Tron arcade game tournament will 
be held in New York City during the week 
the film opens. 

□ Tickets. Money. Action! The film in- 
dustry is always borrowing from the 
latest technology and justly so. Films of- 
t«sn mirror the real world and advance- 
ments in technology affect just about ev- 
eryone. Adapting computer technology 
has not only improved the quality of 
films, but also the efficiency of how 
they're made. 

Now exhibitors are using new tools to 
trim their operations and better serve the 
movie-going public as well. The Pacer 
Corporation in Belle vue, Washington has 
spent years developing a system they 
call Dataticket. Using a Motorola 6809- 



tate standing in line. 

Likewise, if there is a huge rush to buy 
tickets, at whatever time, the result will 
also be ticket buyers waiting in a line. If 
the advance sales were done automati- 
cally at all hours, which they are not as 
yet, it would truly be helpful to the 
rushed, impatient, and disorganized film- 
goer. 

Dataticket offers its most worthwhile 
features to the exhibitor. With all ticket 
sales stored in the computer, it would be 
difficult to miscalculate the inventory. 
You could lose all the ticket stubs from a 
given performance and still have a rec- 
ord on the computer of how many tickets 
were sold. 

In addition, the Dataticket system in- 
cludes a 1,200 baud modem that sends 
box office data to the home office com- 
puter. In a theater chain with more than 
a dozen or so houses, this eliminates a lot 
of phone calling and speeds up account- 
ing. It also helps exhibitors determine, 
faster and more accurately than before, 
how a film is pulling at the box office. 

Only a few large chains are using 
Dataticket at this point; Plitt Theatres, 
based in Chicago, is the largest.

So theater owners now have a way to 
sell tickets faster, count money easier, 
and determine better how profitable it is 
to keep running a film. 

Now if they could only put real butter 
on the popcorn . . . 

□ Copy Catting. Making a copy of infor- 
mation while it's being broadcast has be- 
come easier, and legitimate. It works 
through a system called Codart which is 
composed of a $100 Codart computer, an 
audio tape recorder, and an FM radio. 

Using a catalog, the Codart user se- 
lects the programs he or she would like to 
record, calls the participating station to 
obtain the program's code number, and 
punches it in the computer. When the sta- 



tion broadcasts the program, the com- 
puter automatically turns on the tape re- 
corder, and then switches it off when the 
program is over. 

Codart was originated by a business- 
man named Alan Strachan. It's current- 
ly in operation in San Francisco, where 
KQED, a public station, plays Codart 
programs during its nonbroadcast hours, 
from one to five a.m. The information 
available includes sections of the Wall 
Street Journal, articles from Psychology 
Today, NPR's "All Things Considered," 
jazz and classical music, among others. 

Codart users are billed for the shows 
they record. The fee is split among the 
holder of the program's copyright, the 



participating broadcast station, and 
Codart. Strachan believes that Codart 
can provide a solution to the economic 
problem which recording companies 
face. (By some estimates the recording 
industry is losing 20 percent of its reve- 
nue to home taping.) 

The user benefits by putting together 
a tape through Codart more cheaply than 
he can purchase one in retail outlets. Ac- 
cording to Strachan, Codart also func- 
tions to get the would-be recording engi- 
neer "past the hassle factor." The com- 
puter automatically selects what the user 
wants to hear, even bleeping out 
commercials. 

This summer, Strachan plans to sell 
the computers by mail order to residents 
of the Bay Area. By early next year the 
service should be available in Los Ange- 
les and other cities around the country. 
□ Dogging a Job. SIGI, or system of in- 
teractive guidance and information, is 
currently being used in 140 American col- 
leges and universities as a computer aid 
in career planning. The system was de- 
veloped on a PDP-11 and has been con- 
verted to other mainframes and 
microcomputers. 

The software for SIGI was developed 
by Dr. Martin Katz, a research psy- 
chologist of the Educational Testing Ser- 
vice (ETS), in New Jersey. 

SIGI aids in five processes: identify- 
ing and assigning priorities to work 
values ; matching those values to actual 
occupations ; providing specific informa- 
tion about career fields; listing the re- 
quirements for entry into particular 
fields and evaluating occupations in 
terms of their rewards and drawbacks. 

A participant can work with any of six 
interest fields, including scientific, tech- 
nical, administrative, personal contact, 
verbal, and aesthetic. 

A simulation aspect of the program 
places you in an employment agency and 
requires that you make trade-offs in what 
you want when choosing among jobs, 
thereby ordering your values, such as 
high income, prestige, independence, 
helping others, security, variety, leader- 
ship, working in one's main field of inter- 
est, leisure time, and the desire to enter a 
career field quickly. 

At the California State University 
Northridge campus, SIGI has been in op- 
eration for two years. According to Judy 
Leon, a career counselor at the campus, 
their four SIGI terminals are "constant- 
ly booked." Leon says that "about 80 per- 
cent of the people using it are satisfied 
with the results, while 20 percent feel 
frustrated. The career center stresses 
that SIGI is just one resource in the ca- 
reer decision-making process, to be used 
in conjunction with others." She believes 
that SIGI's greatest area of usefulness is 
in helping to clarify values and make ca- 
reer decisions. To that end, SIGI is used 
by those starting to explore career op- 
tions, as well as by graduate students, 
alumni, and career-changers. 




Introducing DataFax...the easy 
way to tame your Data Monster. 



If you deal with information, 
you're probably dealing with a 
Data Monster 

He's that mass of notes. 
Scribbled messages. Phone 
numbers. And all the thousand- 
and-one other important 
pieces of information you have 
floating around your life. 

But with DataFax from Link 
Systems, you can keep your 
Data Monster under control- 
plus have a lot more power 
over your Information than you 
ever thought possible. 

Unlike most "data manager" 
software programs made for 
your Apple, DataFax doesnt 
care what your data looks like. 
Or how long It Is, how many 
items it has or what you want 
to do with It, 

The power we've pro- 
grammed Into DataFax makes 
it as simple and natural to use 
as a pencil and paper. You can 
fill up a screen with anything 
you want— even information 
already stored on disk. Then 
cross-reference it as many dif- 
ferent ways as you'd like— by a 
date, a species, a customer's 
name, whatever 



So when you need that infor- 
mation, DataFax will retrieve it 
in a way that's meaningful to 
you. The powerful keyword 
function allows you to get infor- 
mation out as quickly and 
easily as you entered it. And 
DataFax is the only software of 
its kind to let you expand from 
floppy to hard disks, so it will 
never be obsolete. 

If getting so *ja* a ' :ax 
much power for ^<\< 
so little effort ^° 



seems too good ; 
to be true, send 
us the cou- _ 
pon and we'll V*- 
send you all 
the details. 
Or see 
your 

Apple computer 
dealer and prove it 
to yourself^ before 
your data situation 



Because whether you've got 
a monster of a data problem— 
or just a small one— DataFax 
can tame it.

HI-RES RAVES 




"A giant step for computerkind! 

Doug Carlston, Broderbund Software and Softalk columnist, February 

1982 

It's the most complete compilation of Apple graphics 
information on the market . . . well worth the price ... the 
shape creation/animation groups of programs constitutes a 
thorough self-study course in this area of Apple program- 
ming, and may well be worth the total package price by 
itself . . . color filling routines are the fastest I've seen . . . 
machine long, routines are thoroughly documented . . . 
represents a significant contribution . . . absolutely packed 
with valuable information . . . tremendous volume of 
knowledge . . . techniques and programs will never lose 
their usefulness . . . in a class by itself . . . bound to 
increase the ranks of good Apple graphics programmers by 
a substantial margin. 

Cary W. Bradley, Softade Review, February 1982 

"Hi-Res Secrets mokes it possible for a programmer 
with a good idea to write a sophisticated game that will 
compete with anything on the market in terms of graphics, 
shapes, sounds, animation and color-fill. How can they self 
this for only $ 125 and not charge a fee for those who might 
use the routines commercially???!!!" 

Stanley Crane, author of DB MASTER**, February 1982 

'The starring attraction of Hi-Res Secrets is it's manual . . . 
professionally produced and very well written . . . designed 
to teach you everything you always wanted to know about 
graphics ... a pleasure to read. 

There is a great deal of knowledge to be gained from 
Hi-Res Secrets. If you've finished with your Applesoft 
manual and feel that you really haven't learned about 
graphics yet . . . go to the section which interests you, read 
it and come away smarter . . . 

You can list the programs on the disks ... an extremely 
valuable learning tool . . .you have access to a working pro- 
gram that really DOES do animation or music or color-fill 
and it's there for you to look at . . . this product has no 
competition on the market ..."

usable index is provided . . .UltraPlot is comparable to Apple Plot in ease of use. The addition of map charts, sucked bar charts, hi-lo graphs and Pie

RACE FOR MIDNIGHT by Steven Sacks (adventure) $29.95

If you enjoy good Hi-Res graphics, unusual sound effects, or exciting adventures, I would suggest Race for Midnight." 

Ulf Lundmark, Softside, December 1 981

package, Hi-Res Secrets." Softalk, December 1 981 

HI-RES COMPUTER GOLF by Stuart Aronoff (computer sports) $29.95 

• "Hi-Res Computer Golf is a masterpiece game of judgement, strategy, visual keenness, and skill . . . Besides the excellence of the graphics within the

game, the authors seem to have thought of every possible detail to make playing the game simple and pleasing to the gamester . " Softolk. February 1 982

THE APPLE SPELLER fills the void 
that has consistently kept the large 
variety of excellent word processing 
packages for the Apple II Computer 
from approaching the power of a 
dedicated work processor. Finally, 
the first professional quality spelling 
verification program is available for 
the Apple II. The Apple Speller will 
certainly be the standard against 
which all other similar programs are 
compared. 

The Apple Speller interfaces to the 
most popular Apple word processors, 
including Applewriter, Apple Pie, 
Executive Secretary, Letter Perfect, 
Magic Window, and Superscribe II, 
just to name a few. In fact, The Apple 
Speller can analyze the output of any 
editor that writes a standard Apple 
binary or text file to a diskette. In 
addition to this flexibility, the per- 
formance of The Apple Speller will 
astound the microcomputer world. 

The Apple Speller is supplied with 
a 30,000+ word dictionary on a 
single 5Va" diskette with additional 
space to easily add another 8,000 
. words to suit your individual needs. 



The Apple Speller has built-in utilities 
to maintain the dictionary diskette. 
You can readily add words, delete 
words, and create an unlimited num- 
ber of modified and/or new diction- 
aries for specific application. 

The Apple Speller is unbelievably 
fast. The first pass reads your docu- 
ment and collects all the words it 
contains at a rate of 5,000 words 
per minute. Next, the words are 
compared to the dictionary for spell- 
ing errors at the incredible speed of 
50,000 words per minute. Finally, all 
misspelled words are marked as 
such in your document with a rate 
of 1,000 words per minute. This 
translates to proofreading a 10 page 
document in 1 minute if there are no 
spelling mistakes and 2 minutes, 15 
seconds for an unlimited number of 
spelling errors. 

Numerous options are provided 
throughout the program to enable 
you to completely control all activi- 
ties of The Apple Speller. These 
include the ability to ignore both 
control codes and formatting com- 
mands, an alphabetical listing of 



either mispelled words or all the 
words in your document along with 
usage frequencies, multiple options

THE BASIC 



Solution 

ByWm.V R. Smith 



Primitive computers evolved to fill the need for manipulat- 
ing numbers in a faster, more accurate way. It could almost be 
said that numbers constitute the blood of a computer system. 

Bearing this simple fact in mind, it's no wonder that the cal- 
culator and numeric control routines published in recent arti- 
cles have aroused special interest among Basic Solution read- 
ers. Many readers have sent in revisions to the Video Tape Cal- 
culator published a few issues back and, more recently, to the 
Input Calculator published in the February issue. 

James Smith of Laguna Niguel, California, found a few 
shortcomings in the Input Calculator. He managed to alleviate 
them by means of a slightly expanded version of the program. 

The first problem Smith found was that the program did not 
recognize parentheses used within an arithmetic expression to 
change the order of precedence of calculation. The second dif- 



ficulty Smith experienced was that the program did not recog- 
nize the character (~) , used in numeric expressions involving 
exponentiation. In his revigion, Smith also included the ability 
to use a quotation mark as the first character in the input en- 
try (as can be done with VisiCalc) . This allows the routine al- 
ways to return the input as a string, regardless of its content. 

You'll find Smith's version of this program valuable in the 
future ; the routine will be used with a number of other rou- 
tines to create a useful Basic program — soon! 

As with any reader who submits a program chosen for the 
Basic Solution, Smith will receive a $10 credit toward his next 
purchase at his local computer store.

talk, 11021 Magnolia Boulevard, North Hollywood, CA 91601.

Microwave. By Jim Nitchals. For too many of us, part of grow- 
ing up is learning what to stop liking. It isn't sophisticated to 
like milk, balloons, cheeseburgers, making snowmen, and car- 
toons. But in reality, it doesn't always work that way. We still 
like milk and cheeseburgers and the bright colors and silly, 
critters of cartoons; it's just that we won't admit it anymore. * 

Jim Nitchals remembers those early pleasures, and he's 
willing to admit he enjoys them still. He's so willing, in fact, 
that he lowers our guard and takes us along for the fun, all 
through computer games. 

First there was Bug Attack. Nitchals coaxed the Apple to 
give us music while we played, at least a third of the time — 
music that went well with the brightly colored ants and plants. 

Now Nitchals brings us Microwave, Cavalier Computer's 
latest home-arcade game, with the same brightly colored 
characters and even more sparkly music. 

The idea in Microwave is to help a tiny teddy bear make his 
way through a multilevel maze, picking up all the safe objects 
he finds while he avoids the enemy and the bombs the enemy 
leaves lying around. You can use a joystick or keyboard to 
guide Teddy through the maze. The enemy consists of four fun- 
ny looking, totally imaginative characters who chase you and 
try to cut you off; contact with any of them is fatal. 

Avoidance is the best defense, but you have one weapon as 
well: your trusty microwave gun. This new-fangled weapon 
takes some getting used to, of course. You don't really shoot it ; 
you drop the microwave behind you — its beam streaking off as 
far as it can in the direction from which you've come. Since the 
bad guys are often chasing you, that's good — you can some- 
times get several with one blow. 

Prominent in the music — an amalgam of several pieces 
—are old-time cartoon themes: chase music, getting caught 
music, laugh-a-lot music. The music is constant, which is quite 
an achievement on the Apple during a fast action game. Only 
when all four foes are active and you've just shot a microwave 
does the action slow down. 

Microwave strategy may remind you of some other home- 
arcade games, but the subject, the details, and the graphics 
make it definitely its own game. 

With its bright, cheerful colors, its silly, happy music, and 
its very playable, addict-pleasing gamability, Microwave 
looks like a total winner — especially for people who like 
cartoons. Come on, admit it; who doesn't? n(T

Night Mission Pinball. By Bruce Art wick. Only two programs 
appeared on Sof talk's bestseller list every month of its first 
twelve. One is no surprise; it's VisiCalc. The other was a con- 
tinual surprise: Flight Simulator, by Bruce Artwick, pub- 
lished by SubLogic. Never far from the top for more than a 
year, Flight Simulator finally gave way to newer fare. But 
every couple of months it reappears — not so near the top, but 
anywhere on the top thirty is something to write home about. 

Now Bruce Artwick offers another game and proves that, 
while he may not be prolific, he is definitely able. The game is 
Night Mission Pinball and the verdict is fantastic. 

Not satisfied with an ordinary pinball simulation, Artwick 
has opened many of the options of the pinball creator to the 
player. You can choose any of ten modes designed by Art- 
wick — or you can design your own mode, and save ft. Actual- 
ly, you can design and save as many as ninety modes of your 
own, plus ten modifications of SubLogic modes, and still have 
the original ten modes on disk at the same time. 



Among the parameters you can set are ball speed, bounce 
of bumpers or flippers, duration of hold in trap, visibility of ball 
trails, tilt sensitivity and effect — and just about everything 
else. You can even have a detailed history of the ball's path up 
to the past five thousand or so x,y coordinates. 

With so many homemade modes possible, it isn't surpris- 
ing that you must save them on a separate disk. However/it's 
a minor irritation that the high score also m.ust be maintained 
on a separate disk. 

All this good stuff wasn't really necessary. Night Mission 
Pinball was quite enough just the way it was designed to begin 
with. 

It has a theme : you are running a night bombing mission 
over several Pacific cities during World War n. The sound ef- 
fects greatly augment the theme. 

The color hi-res graphics in Night Mission Pinball are 
superb, as is the animation. The configuration of features — 
placement of bumpers, difficulty of dropping through side, dis- 
tance between flippers, and so on — is realistic and competitive. 

You even have to insert a quarter to play. Luckily, if you 
just push Q, your Apple will insert it for you. This seemingly 
unnecessary touch makes winning free games a lot more fun. 

Don't miss the Cosmic Mode. It's just what you've always 
dreamed of since the day you first thought, "Gee, I wish they'd 
make a pinball machine where all the balls were slinkies."

Apple Spice. Apple Spice is a tool to broaden the powers of 
Applesoft by means of the & and usr functions. Essentially five 
new features are added to the language: print using, a string 
search routine, if-then-else logic, and expanded input and out- 
put formatting. 

PriJit using emulates the print-formatting capability of 
some larger Basics (like the Apple Ill's Business Basic). Us- 
ing using, you can control the number of digits displayed, align 
decimal points, align dollar signs or let them float against the 
leftmost digit in a figure, print a trail of asterisks to the left of a 
figure or between a dollar sign and a figure — and a good deal 
more. The Apple Spice version of print using comes with a han- 
dy option : you can string together in one program statement a 
group of numbers separated by exclamation points, and the 
print using function will align them vertically according to 
your specifications. 

The string search routine gives you the ability to hunt for 
one string within another. This can be especially useful in a 
tutorial program or an adventure game where you, the pro- 
grammer, may only care whether — and not where — a certain 
word appears in a user's response. To be sure, you could ac- 
complish this string search with a mid$ statement and a for- 
loop; Spice's routine will do it faster and will also report the 
position within the target string where the search string is 
found. It will even allow you to define multiple search strings 
in the same program statement, much the way the match 
statement in Pilot does. 

The if-then-else logic works just as it does in other Basics, 
except that when the if condition fails, the else is allowed to 
execute several program lines, not merely one. 

The extended input package offers such niceties as display 
of commas and colons within input strings, use of the left-ar- 
row key to cancel characters from display as well as from 
memory, and automatic word wrap. The one sacrifice you 
have to make in order to get these features is the use of a 
prompt string within an input statement. You'll have to print 
your prompts and reserve input for the user's response. 



Finally, the output package provides a number of screen- 
formatting amenities, including automatic word wrap and 
double — or other multiple — line spacing. It even gives you an 
automatic paging capability, by printing a message at the bot- 
tom of the screen telling the user to hit return when ready for 
the next page. 

The Apple Spice documentation is thorough and clear, and 
the routines are easy to incorporate within your own pro- 
grams. All in all, this is a powerful expansion of Applesoft.

Congo. By Michael Berlyn with Harry Wilker. Former science 
fiction author Mike Berlyn has taken a break after producing 
the superb text adventure, Cyborg, to try his hand at the 
arcades. The result is an excellent beginning with a few twists 
you may find intriguing. 

Congo is a colorful hi-res representation of a raft trip down 
the Congo river. Your ship was wrecked somewhere up- 
stream; of all your shipmates, you're the only one who's been 
resourceful enough to build a raft from the debris. Now, as you 
float downstream, you find your shipmates stranded on is- 
lands and along the not-too-friendly shore hoping for a lift. 
Your task is to rescue them and take them to safe harbors. 

Now for the problems. Unfriendly natives frequent the 
river in canoes ; if they come upon you, they'll run you down. 
Islands and shoals seem to wait to tear apart your raft. White 
panthers stalk the shore nervously; and many safe harbors 
harbor unsafe crocodiles. Just as you master navigating the is- 
lands and avoiding the natives, more problems arise. Spouting 
hippos swim upstream in your path, more islands occur, 
natives paddle faster; eventually, blue water snakes, swift and 
deadly, begin appearing from behind you. 

You control your raft with joystick or keyboard; the 
scenery moves one way as you move the other when you're go- 
ing downstream — it works, it looks like you're really moving 
down the river. When you want to stop or move upstream, the 
drift keeps you going down but at a much slower rate. 

The graphics are not the polished Nasir type, but they are 
funky and attractive. Occasionally you may be convinced you 
didn't hit an island that did you in, but you'll soon learn your 
limitations. Sound effects are few but effective ; play at night in 
an otherwise silent room for best results. 

A nice touch is the presentation of extra rafters (playing 
pieces). Action halts while you're treated to an Apple rendi- 
tion of "Bongo, Bongo, Bongo, I Don't Want To Leave the Con- 
go"; then your raft is taken to an island, picks up a stranded 
friend, and deposits him in the spot that tells you how many 
lives you have left. 

Congo begins at a slower pace than shoot 'em ups, but it 
picks up; and it's lots of fun. Other test players have noted also 
that Congo is a truly nonviolent arcade game that works. You 
do not bother the creatures of Congo; you are, albeit acci- 
dentally, the intruder and your job is to ensure your safety and 
that of your friends by avoiding these creatures, not by killing 
them or even disturbing them. If the idea of shooting impossi- 
bly imaginary aliens bothers you or if you disapprove of Road- 
runner cartoons, you may leap on Congo for these reasons. If 
not, just enjoy Congo as the good, unique home-arcade game it 
is. no

Minotaur. By Larry Miller. Sirius has been marketing a lot of 
games recently, including Twerps, Borg, Snake Byte, Com- 
puter Foosball, and Kabul Spy. Minotaur is by far the best of 
the bunch. 

This arcade-style game from the author of Hadron and 
Epoch puts you in the role of Theseus, hero of Greek mytholo- 
gy, whose task is to search for the Minotaur in a maze and kill 
the unholy wretch. In Minotaur, a maze has four levels (each 
level is a maze unto itself) connected by stairways ; some stair- 
ways go up and down, some just go one way.

. . . Computer Portrait Subsystem for the Apple II 



Computer Station has put it all together. The 
portrait subsystem allows Apple II owners to 
create computer portraits that may be heat 
transferred to create customized T-shirts, 
posters, and other novelty items. The portrait 
system is now available for fun or profit. 

The Portrait Subsystem requires a 48K Apple II 
with Applesoft, one disk drive, game paddles, at 
least one monitor, and either an Epson MX-80 
printer with graphics option, or Centronics 739 
printer. The subsystem includes the means for 
creating the portrait on the screen by focusing a 
video camera on the subject. Two monitors are 



recommended to view the regular video on one 
and the digitized image on the other. The game 
paddles are used to control intensity and contrast 
so as to be able to create interesting effects as well 
as clear portraits. The composed digitized picture 
may be frozen on the screen at any time to view the 
finished result. The picture may also be saved to 
disk, if desired. The portrait software allows the 
digitized picture to be dumped to the printer by 
simply pressing the "P" key for print. Prior to prin- 
ting, the entire image is reversed on the screen so 
as to print a "mirror image" suitable for heat 
transfer. The printed picture is approximately 9 
1/2 by 8 inches. 



The entire portrait subsystem includes the 
Dithertizer II TM with video camera for input, the 
Station Master TM printer interface card with 
cable, portrait software, and starter supply set in- 
cluding special ribbons. Suggested retail for the 
Portrait Subsystem is $1175.00.

displays you and your immediate whereabouts, about one- 
twentieth of the level you're on. Trotting along at a brisk pace, 
you are liable to turn a corner and, without warning, come face 
to face with Momus, or some other nasty creature. The author 
thoughtfully gives you ninety-nine lives. 

Armed with a laser sword, Theseus has to contend with 
many ferocious monsters before finding the Minotaur, who's 
always on level four of a maze. Room monsters like dragons, 
snakes, cyclops, centaurs, and cobras are confined to certain 
parts of the maze and don't reappear once you blast them. 

On the other hand, hall creatures like furies, skeletons, and 
Charon are the personal henchmen of the Minotaur and can be 
found all over the maze. When you are killed by one of the op- 
position, you lose some of your ninety-nine lives ; the number of 
lives you lose depends on the creature. 

It's not all one-sided, thdugjh..' In addition to your laser 
sword, you can acquire various' things to help you in your 
search. Skulls and virgins garner you more lives, though you 
can never have more than ninety-nine lives at one time. Clubs 
help you to bash through walls and floors. Wings give you the 
power to fly above the level of the maze you are on and see 
things you can't see from the ground. 

The elixir allows you to leave your body and wander 
through the maze at will as a spirit. You can go through walls 
and find out useful information, but look out for Charon, the 
one hall creature that can only kill you when you're in spirit 
form. 

With all of these good things to help you and so many horri- 
ble enemies to smite, Minotaur is a game with a lot of punch. 
You can get pretty fancy in your tactics, like using the elixir 
and the wings at the same time. 

There are five levels of speed and the highest makes for 
pretty fast action. Once you've killed the Minotaur you start a 
new maze. There are a total of thirty-two mazes, all with four 
levels. 

Playable with joystick, keyboard, or paddles, Minotaur

Cashbook 2.0. Here's a personal or small-business single-entry 
accounting system with an Australian accent. Checks are 
cheques and dates are entered DDMMYY. You may override 
that default date format to make it match the common Ameri- 
can practice of entering the month before the date, but you 
may well prefer to leave it alone. Cashbook is written in such a 
way as to require a minimum of keystrokes. Recording trans- 
actions that have occurred on separate days within the same 
month is simpler in the Australian manner than it is in the 
American. 

Cashbook is a model of friendliness. The program offers 
single-key commands to increment or decrement transaction 
numbers. The rejection of illegal data is accompanied by a 
polite, informative error message. Should you forget what's 
expected of you at any point, the escape key will bring down a 
help message. The manual, while sparse, is lucid enough to 
bring the newcomer on board with a minimum of hassle. 

Transactions are recorded in six fields, including a fifteen- 
character memo but, unfortunately, no tax flag. Up to five dis- 
bursement codes are allowed per transaction so that transac- 
tions can be split into separate accounting categories. The pro- 
gram verifies that the total of the disbursements equals the 
amount on the check or deposit. At the top of the transaction 
screen, Cashbook displays the current checkbook balance 
along with the totals of outstanding checks and deposits. Items 
not yet reconciled — through the program's reconcile module — 
are available for editing. 

Transactions are stored on disk in one large file ; the maxi- 
mum number of entries in that file is about 600. To forestall 
disk overflow and to speed up search and sort operations, the 
program offers the option of deleting reconciled items. You'll 
probably want to back up files in toto for individual months or 
groups of months and delete reconciled material from your 
working disk. The number of disbursement categories permit- 
ted is sixty. The percentages of that allotment and of the avail- 
able transaction space that you've consumed are revealed 
when you quit the program. 

Additional features include a single-field search capability, 
the capacity to sort and rearrange data by transaction num- 
ber, and various kinds of lists— including monthly or yearly 
summations by disbursement category. One feature that some 
users will miss is the ability to key in a budget and generate re- 
ports of actual expenditures versus projected amounts. C>

Tumble Bugs. By Bob Bishop. Bishop's back and bugs have 
brought him. Tumble Bugs is a home arcade game, and one of 
the silliest to come along in a long time. It's also addicting. 

At first look, Tumble Bugs seems like another eating game, 
but it isn't. It does take place in a maze and the objects you're 
collecting (Tanna leaves, although it's irrelevant) look just like 
dots. 

Twist one: You can see the whole maze as it randomly 
generates — different every time — but as soon as you begin 
playing, you're treated to a magnifying-glass view of a very 
small area with you in the center. You can see the rest of the 
maze behind you, except the crucial part just beyond your 
magnified view. 

This wouldn't be important except that the maze is infested 
with creepy-crawlies who can't tell Tanna from you. 

Twist two: The bugs are dumb and slow. Their paths have 
nothing to do with where you are ; they're neither after you nor 
frightened by you. They're just relentless. You are much fast- 
er than they are, so if you see them in time, and if you're not 
trapped in a dead end, you can get away easily. 

It wouldn't be a problem, if you only could just see a little 
more! 

The bugs do, however, gloat when they get you. 

Even the sounds are silly. But then, Apple Panic was one of

The Graphics Magician. By Chris Jochumson, David Lubar 
and Mark Pelczarski. One of the most exciting aspects of own- 
ing a personal computer is the thrill you can get from creating 
something you don't have the skills to make without this flexi- 
ble tool. If you're a sloppy typist, the first time you write a let- 
ter with a word processor, edit it, and watch your printer 
"type" it on your own letterhead far faster and neater than you 
could do, you're delighted. 

If you love music but don't have the coordination to play 
two correct notes in a row, it's unbelievably exciting to enter 
your own composition with nine-part polyphony into a music 
editor and hear your Apple play it through the same stereo you 
use for Bach, Beethoven and the Beatles. 

And if you can't even draw a straight line without a ruler, 
you'll give yourself a wide smile and a pat on the back the first 
time that you see a bird you've designed flap its way across 
your screen and, after it's disappeared, be replaced with a full 
color, hi-res adventure scene you've drawn yourself. 

The comparisons with word editors and music editors are 
apt, for The Graphics Magician is a picture editor designed to 
make it easy for a programmer to include both multi-color hi- 
res graphic stills and small animated figures that repetitively 
move various parts in sequence as the entire figure moves 
across the screen. 

Three separate packages are included : an animation pack- 
age, an editor for drawing a full screen picture and indepen- 
dently placing one or more objects in that scene (like a desert 
with a snake that appears and disappears), and a program 

live!

Apple is a trademark of Apple Computer, Inc 



alphaSyntauri is a trademark of Syntauri Corporation 



called Super Shapes, designed to extend Applesoft's shape 
tables. 

Within the animation package are three editors. In the first 
one, seven drawing areas appear in the hi-res graphics window 
of the screen, with a menu in the text window below. Using the 
I, J, K and M keys, the user creates on the screen seven slight- 
ly different shapes, each of which will be one frame of the ani- 
mation of the figure. After these are saved, a path editor lets 
the animator use the same cursor control keys plus four more 
for diagonal moves to set whatever path the user chooses his 
figure to take— right, left, up, down, loops, disappearing off the 
screen for a while and reappearing, and so on. The shape and 
its path are brought together in the third editor which then per- 
forms the actual display. Up to thirty-two different shapes, 
each with its own path, can be moving about on the screen at a 
time. 

Too old for arcade games but you'd like to write your own 
high-res-type adventure game? The Magician's second pack- 
age provides a white "canvas" and a cursor that's manipu- 
lated with the game paddles. Button 1 holds a temporary cur- 
sor at a point while the working cursor is moved to another. 
Pushing button zero draws a straight line between them. After 
an area is completely enclosed by lines, a few key strokes, cur- 
sor placement, and pushes of button 0 fill the enclosed space 
with color. 

A palette that is provided offers 108 different colors to 
choose from. A few of these are solid, but most are mixtures 
that, because of the Apple's treatment of hi-res colors, appear 
as plaids rather than as a solid color. With some care, you can 
turn this drawback into an advantage; a brick wall can be 
simulated without drawing all the lines, for example. 

In a four-row text window at the bottom of the screen is a 
byte meter that shows how many bytes the picture will take up 
on the disk. Even a complicated picture doesn't take very 
many. Instead of storing each dot of the hi-res screen, the Ma- 
gician stores instructions to redraw the picture when it's called 
from the disk. For example, a large red door the height of the 
screen required thirty-five bytes— four to start, three for each 
line no matter how long, five to select the color and fill the rec- 
tangle, six to place a black door knob, and eight more to touch 
up a few dots near the knob that had the wrong color. 

As thrilling as it is to see your own seagull flap across your 
screen or your own multicolored castle, complete with bricks 
and mortar joints, the Magician isn't a toy. It's designed as a 
tool for programmers to help them design and store graphics 
files that will be called from their own Basic or machine lan- 
guage programs. As a result, the instruction manual, although 
clear, is very concise, requiring careful reading and some 
backtracking; there is no tutorial. Nevertheless, two to three 
hours should be enough for everyone but a beginner to master 
either the animation package or the picture /object editor. The 
actual use of these pictures in a program depends on a per- 
son's programming skills. Although competence in machine 
language isn't necessary, some familiarity with it and a will- 
ingness to manipulate program locations within the Apple's 
memory map are needed; it's not a package for pokephobes. 

As a bonus that to some people may be worth the price of 
the entire disk, the authors have included a utility program 
that will transfer binary files from one disk to another. This 
utility — hooray — prints out the starting address and length of 
the binary file. Every Apple system master disk ought to come 
with this one. (L

The home reproduction was outstanding, but the game got lost 
among the mishmash of mediocrity put out by Programma, its

ing inti-lliuenl and informed decisions when purchasing software. 

Currently, tin Apple Computer owner is presented with a 
Ih w ildt rinu selection of software from which to choose. On the 
one hand, this should plea.se you in that, as the owner of probably 
the most popular micro- computer in the world, you have a wide 
and rapidly urow in 14 selection of software from which to choose. 
On the other hand, this wide and growing selection presents some 
problems. The \ ast majority of retail computer store staff people 
simph just do not have the time to adequately review each new 
piece of software that comes in their store. The problem is com- 
pounded if the new program is an extensive or complicated one. 
such as an accounting package or a word processing system, or a 
comprehensive data base management program. This does not 
mean that store personnel do not want to give you the best service 
possible: it's just that it is an almost impossible task. If you pur- 
chase software through the mail, the risks that you assume, 
without a reliable miide to assist you should be apparent. 

Other pitfalls aw ait the uninformed buyer. For instance, in too 
many cases you cannot by the appearance of the package whether 
the program requires Integer Basic or Applesoft Basic or whether 
it needs 16. 32 or 48k of RAM. It is also often difficult to tell 
w hen you purchase a program on tape whether it can be trans- 
ferred to disk or. if a disk program is purchased, whether it can 
be copied or not. 

Another area that can present problems to the buyer is the 
similarity of software. A well-stocked computer store may 
possibly offer five different word processing packages, four 
assemblers, ten different adventure type games and/or several 
mail list programs, (the choices seem endless); all of which have 
oh* ions advantages and disadvantages as well as different prices. 

The goal of "The Book" is to eliminate as many of these poten- 
tial problem areas for the software buyer as possible. 

We w elcome any comments or criticisms from readers that will 
help us in reaching this goal. 

'Obviously, Apple and Apple Computer Co. is mentioned many 
times throughout "The Book." Apple II is a registered trademark

be on all Apple Computer owners shelves.

on a mobile seesaw in the circus. Hanging from the rafters of 
the big top were two rows of balloons. On either side of the ring 
(screen) were platforms about half way up. When play began, 
a second little clown would prance out upon one of the plat- 
forms and gracefully leap off. The player had to see that the 
empty end of the seesaw was there to catch him ; of course, his 
landing bounced the original clown into the air, where he would 
pop as many balloons as he could. Then you'd have to catch 
him too. 

If you missed the little clown, he always landed directly on 
his head and shouted, "Nu! " You got five of them to start and 
two more as bonuses before the game, written in Integer, 
kicked out at 32,747 points. The music was terrific. 

Juggler returns to that cotton candy ambiance, except that 
the equipment is more detailed and more modern and the ani- 
mation is perfectly smooth. Instead of clowns, you have three 
circus jugglers. They toss various objects into the air as an aid 
to keeping the balls and cylinders that they're juggling aloft. If 
you like, you can toggle off the helping stream of objects and 
juggle directly with your jugglers' hands, but it's much harder. 

Unlike the clowns in Clowns and Balloons, the jugglers are 
never wasted. They merely lose their turn if they miss, and one 
game has three turns. 

It may be nonviolent, but they don't go "Nu! " It's no fun to 
see little clowns expire, but "Nu!" makes you laugh. 

Oh, well, There is not a whole lot to Juggler, but what there 
is is beautifully done ; and the challenge to score well is real. 
Those who enjoy using Pong-type skills are sure to like Jug- 
gler a lot. n(T

Psort. By R. J. Long. Psort is a utility package for users of the 
Apple Pascal operating system. It is designed to permit alpha- 
betic sorting and merging of files. Psort is provided on disk in 
three forms: as a compiled (to P-code) program for immedi- 
ate, independent execution; as the source files for that 
compiled file for program modification by the user; and as 
source code for a Psort procedure to be included in user 
programs. 

Files to be sorted can be either text files or files of fixed- 
length strings. Files of strings are sorted more quickly than 
text files but may consume more disk space. 

The disk is not protected, so the software can be used in con- 
junction with a Corvus or other hard disk drive. This feature is 
very useful, since the sorting of large files requires intermedi- 
ate files on disk that use a good deal of disk real estate. 

Psort is designed to operate on files that are viewed as se- 
quences of records, whether those files are simple text files or 
data files consisting of a sequence of records of some user-de- 
fined type. A record consists of one or more fields, each of 
which is reserved for a particular class of data. Any of these 
fields can be designated as keys— the fields that will be used to 
sort the records into order. 

The Psort system allows you to use either fixed or variable 
length keys (up to 10 of them) to sort files. A set of parameters 
you create determines which fields of each record will serve as 
keys, and in what order the keys are evaluated. These param- 
eters can either be entered by you at the time that Psort is exe- 
cuted, or can be stored in a text file that Psort accesses at exe- 
cution time. This text file can be interactively created by you 
through the execution of the Sortparm program, which asks 
you a series of questions about the nature of the input, the sort- 
ing task, and the desired form of the output. The twenty-page 
manual clearly explains the options and shows you how to use 
Psort and Sortparm. 

Unfortunately, a number of serious flaws are evident in the 
current version of Psort. In an initial test, Psort.code was exe- 
cuted to sort a short (16-block) test file, consisting of 193 rec- 
ords—lines of text — each with two sorting fields. The sort was 
completed correctly in two minutes and fifty-one seconds : not 
a speed record, but the package did the job. But when the sort- 
ing of a larger file was attempted, a bug was revealed. Large 
files are sorted into two or more temporary work files by 
Psort. When the initial sorting process is completed, the pro- 



gram is then supposed to merge the intermediate files into a 
single, larger output file, and to purge the intermediate files. 
Instead of merging the two temporary files, Psort appended 
one to the other; the output this produced was not a correct 
sort. 

Local Apple dealers we contacted were unfamiliar with 
Psort. Although the hotline expert at Apple told us that early 
releases had a problem that had been fixed, and that Apple 
dealers could supply updated disks at no charge, Psort disks 
found at local stores had earlier copyright dates than the one 
being used for this review. 

Examination of the Psort disk files revealed an interesting 
anomaly. The Psort.code file was dated 25-Feb-80, while the 
Psort. text file, one of the source code files supposedly included 
in the compilation of Psort, had the later date of 19-Jan-81. Ap- 
parently Special Delivery Software was made aware of the 
merge bug in Psort, got the source code correction, but ne- 
glected to recompile the program. 

Since all the source code files for Psort are provided, it is 
possible to recompile the program. Sixty-eight blocks are re- 
quired for the source files and twenty-five blocks for the resul- 
tant P-code compiled version, so a two (or more) drive Apple n 
is needed to recompile the program. The revised program ap- 
pears to be syntactically and semantically correct. 

It would be nice to be able to report that no further prob- 
lems were encountered using the recompiled version of Psort. 
Unfortunately, the program seems to invoke a rarely en- 
countered system bug. This bug seems to crop up once every 
year or so for developers of large applications programs in Ap- 
ple Pascal and has something to do with the treatment of page 
boundaries in the P-code interpreter. 

It is possible to defeat the system bug. Simply go back to the 
program and insert some new source code — say, a few debug- 
ging statements in PsortS.text, in order to make the code file 
page boundaries come at different points. With luck the re- 
compiled program will now work correctly.

Once the Psort program has been compiled in a working 
version by the user, it works adequately but slowly. Five text 
files of sixteen to twenty-two blocks were sorted individually, 
from two minutes, fifty-one seconds to nine minutes, fourteen 
seconds. The merge feature was then used to merge and com- 
bine the resulting sorts into a single file of ninety blocks. This 
was a slow process (more than twenty minutes), due in part, no 
doubt, to the newly inserted write statements that had mysteri- 
ously gotten rid of the page boundary bug. 

The Psort package is likely to be of use to moderately so- 
phisticated Pascal programmers who are willing to recompile 
the sources provided, and perhaps to make minor modifica- 
tions. It is not a practical utility for users who don't have pro- 
gramming experience. Afl

Peeping Tom. By Michael Livesay. On a scale ranging from 
Roach Hotel to Data Factory, Peeping Tom is about a six. 
That's okay, for a game. By the way, Micro Lab, company of 
diversity, brought you the whole scale. 

Peeping Tom is Micro Lab's second home-arcade game 
and by far its best. It's a shoot-'em-upward with a truly new 
twist: the foe is behind shuttered windows. The ship you con- 
trol is below the windows but where it can shoot at them. So 
you must gauge where the enemies are by where their bombs 
are landing (often on you). 

There is hope. As soon as you shoot an enemy, the portion of 
the window it was behind opens. In the first level, the window is 
divided in quarters ; level two has a window divided vertically 
into seven or eight long skinny sections. Still higher levels? 
Who knows? 

Each level consists of about eight waves of creatures, each 
different in looks and behavior. There's a freshly closed win- 
dow for each flavor of adversary. 

Peeping Tom is difficult and challenging, a good twist on an 
old theme. n(T

VC-Manager, by Lawrence Chapman, Micro Decision Sys- 
tems (Box 1392, Pittsburgh, PA 15219; 412-276-2387). VisiCalc 
offers various ways of consolidating separate worksheets. You 
can overlay one model with another, or you can send data from 
one model to another by way of a DIF file. You can even 
manipulate a worksheet by means of a /PD file. But there isn't 
any simple way to add one model to another — or to perform 
any other arithmetic operation on two or more models at once. 
VC-Manager now fills that need. 

This utility lets you specify as many as fifteen VisiCalc files 
and perform whatever manipulations you wish on them. You 
can add file one to file two and divide the sum by file three — or 
whatever. Individual rows, though not individual cells, may be 
exempted from the calculation. Files may be either /SS or 
DIF; if you're combining /SS files, you can specify the global 
format of the output file, if you wish. 

Typical uses for VC-Manager might include the summa- 
tion of data from separate months or years, or the calculation 
of differences between one period and another. The arithmetic 
manipulations can include constants as well as file data, so it's 
possible to divide the difference between one sheet and an- 
other by one hundred, as a way of arriving at percent variance. 

If the spreadsheets to be combined are not identical in con- 



struction, VC-Manager will do its best to combine them any- 
way. If it finds a blank in a cell on one sheet and data in the cor- 
responding cell of another, it will simply treat the blank as a 
zero and print a message reporting the possible mismatch. Di- 
visions by zero it reports as zero, rather than error. Where it 
finds labels, it will copy the label from the first-named input 
file into the resulting output file. Where it finds a label in one 
model aligned with a value in another, it treats the value as a 
label and processes it accordingly. $65. 

From Chips to Systems: An Introduction to Microprocessors. 

Book by Rodnay Zaks, Sybex (2344 Sixth Street, Berkeley, CA 
94718; 415-848-8233). This may well be the most readable of 
Zaks's many contributions to the Sybex line. It's an introduc- 
tory text on microprocessor chips and the chips that cooperate 
with microprocessors to build computing systems. The book 
starts out with basic technological concepts, explaining, 
among other things, the differences between cmos, nmos, 
pmos, and other technologies; it then proceeds to an explana- 
tion of the inner workings of a microprocessor and finally adds 
a great deal of informative material about the chips that en- 
able a microprocessor to communicate with the outside world. 
In its detailed discussion of microprocessors, the book uses In- 
tel's 8080 for a model; however, the concepts presented apply 
to all microprocessors, including the Apple's 6502. This is a 
compact text that covers a lot of ground, and the lay reader 
will have to work a little to absorb the material and keep up 
with Zaks. Fortunately, the writing is clear enough that it 
won't leave the novice in the dust at chapter one. The abun- 
dant illustrations are a big help. $14.95. ui

places like that to see if they were interested in software." 

Connecting the Dots. "For the next four months," Pelczar- 
ski recalls, "I was straight programming full-time, develop- 
ing a lot of ideas. Many things just seemed to fall into place. 

"It was pretty much work on it, stop for lunch, work on it 
some more, stop for dinner. If we weren't doing anything, work 
on it until one or two in the morning." 

Pelczarski performed Beta-testing by having various 
friends who were interested in graphics use his program. "I 
kept all the documentation in Apple Writer files. I'd revise the 
files any time someone said something wasn't clear. I would 
give them copies of the program and say, 'I'm not going to tell 
you anything about it.' In several cases, I would sit right be- 
hind them and watch what they were doing and find out where 
they were having trouble. I'd let them play with it without any 
prompting." 

These testers ranged from total beginners through experi- 
enced users. "In most cases they were people who hadn't seen 
any graphics packages before." 

Originally, he had planned to send prototypes to estab- 
lished software publishers to generate an income from royal- 
ties. But, "When the package came out better than I ever 
imagined, I started thinking of publishing it myself." 

In April 1981, Pelczarski unveiled The Complete Graphics 
System. 

Quotable Quotes. "I sent out copies to magazines for re- 
view. Several did nice reviews." 

At the time there were about one thousand dealers in the in- 
dustry, and Pelczarski started doing dealer mailings. "To one 
group of dealers we sent a demo disk that goes through all the 
features. To another group, we sent copies of the manual. To 
another, we sent both demo disks and the manual. To another 
we sent just information saying, 'Here we are, and here's what 
we've got.' 

"The responses were all about the same." 

Overall, he doesn't feel the mailings were very significant. 
"The best returns we had were in advertising. The dealers 
would pick up the magazines, see the ads, and give us a call. 

"We solo? quite a few right away, from the ads. Then when 
the reviews came out in June, we started selling more and 
more. It just kept building up. By July or August, we were 
breaking even with everything we'd invested in." Pelczarski 
also credits Applef est /Boston with helping sales. 

Curtain Calls. Response from users has resulted in more 
than half-a-dozen revisions of the program since its first publi- 
cation. With each upgrade, the Penguin staff sent a letter of- 
fering to replace the older version for five dollars. 

"We did have a protection system on the original version 
until this February," Pelczarski says, then he took it off to al- 
low for easier use. 

The tiny company now has three Apples to develop soft- 
ware on and is designing some games. Two additional pro- 
grams, The Graphics Magician and Special Effects, have been 
released. 

The three programs in the line have given Penguin what 
Pelczarski believes are "the best in Apple graphics soft- 
ware — a designer's package (Complete Graphics), an artist's 
package (Special Effects), and a programmer's package 
(Graphics Magician) . 

"Dollarwise," he says, "I'd probably be making as much 
and have fewer headaches if I'd let someone else publish my 
software. But along with the headaches, there's a great deal of 
satisfaction from doing it ourselves and having control over 
matters. Plus the learning. ..." 

Broderbund and Penguin, explorers, small businesspeo- 
ple, competitors in some ways, yet friendly ones. They help 
each other. Just as pioneers always have. 31

MAY 1982 





Last month, we crawled inside Apple's DOS, peeked around 
at its vocabulary, and did some poking to change things just a 
bit. Hopefully we're still friends, and you and your disks sur- 
vived. We're about to make some more DOS changes, so get 
out one of your "expendable" disks (in case of accident) and 
poke along. Remember, if you follow instructions, the only way 
anything can possibly go wrong is if: 

1. You make a typo. 

2. I made a typo. 

3. Softalk made a typo. 

Now, I know #2 and #3 have happened before, and I have my 
suspicions about #1. Fear not; you can always reboot if your 
Apple misbehaves. 

Changing DOS's Vocabulary. Remember, DOS resides in 
the changeable memory area (RAM) of your Apple, so we can 
get in there and fool around with it. Let's start by renaming a 
DOS command. There are programs that will do sophisticated 
DOS alterations for you, but you can make some changes your- 
self without much software. First, type in this program; it's 
another version of last month's vocabulary peeker: 

Note: All programs are written for 48K. If you 
have 32K, subtract 16,384 from all address values. 

]10 REM DOS SNOOP 

20 FOR X = 43140 TO 43271 

30 PRINT X; 

40 P = PEEK(X): PRINT P ; 

50 IF P > 127 THEN INVERSE 

60 HTAB 12: PRINT CHR$(P): NORMAL 

70 IF P>127 THEN PRINT " " 

80 NEXT X 

Run the program; use control-S to pause. If you have a print- 
er, make a printout for reference. Here's what you should see 
(inverse is indicated with parentheses) : 



43140,73 


1 


43141,78 


N 


43142,73 


1 ' 


43143,212 


(T) 


43144,76 


L 


43145,79 


O 


43146,65 


A 


43147,196 


(D) 


43148,83 


S 


43149,65 


A 


43150,86 


V 


43151,197 


(E) 



43152, etc. 



You should see all twenty-eight DOS commands spelled out 
vertically with addresses and values for each letter. Notice 
how the last letter of each command is the high-byte version of 
the letter, 128 higher than normal. Without further explana- 
tion, let's change the save command word. Type the following 
command with no line number: 



POKE 43150,70 (return) 

Now try to save the program you typed in previously by 
typing Save DOS Snoop (return) . It won't work. In fact, your 
Apple will hang up completely, eating its cursor (yuck!) and 
making you hit reset to continue. Now, type run and control-S 
to look at what has happened to save, the third command. It 
has been changed to "safe"! The poke we just did inserted an 
"f", whose ASCII value is 70, at location 43150 (see the ASCII 
conversion program at the end of this article) . Another way to 
insert the "f" would have been: 

POKE 43150,ASC("F") 

So now you can "safe" a program, but you can't "save" it. 
In most cases, if you change a command word and the original 
command is typed, your Apple will say "?Syntax error" and 
hand the flashing cursor back to you. The reason your Apple 
froze up when "save" was typed is that save is the Applesoft 
command for saving data to cassettes. Your Apple was wait- 
ing for you to press the play and record buttons on your cas- 
sette recorder (boy, are you lucky you have a disk drive!). 

You can change any letter of any DOS command to any 
character you want, including control characters. Remem- 
ber, to change the last letter of a command, you must add 128 
to the new letter's low-byte ASCII value. For example, let's 
change save (or safe) to keep. That can be done with four 
pokes, either in a program or directly from the keyboard, like 
so: 

POKE 43148,ASC("K") 
POKE 43149,ASC("E") 
POKE 43150,ASC("E") 
POKE 43151,ASC("P")+128 

Hit return, of course, after each line. Now save your program 
by typing Keep DOS Snoop (return) . You did it! If you want to 
change a command's length, you'll have to do some semi-hairy 
manipulations. To shorten a command, slide every character 
of every following command up to fill the gap. To lengthen a 
command, you'll have to shorten another one first . . . we'll let 
you cope with that alone. But fool around with it; it's fun! 

Saving DOS Changes. Let's say we want to keep "keep" 
and have it be our save command when a certain disk is used. 
The easiest way to keep it is to init a new disk while the keep 
command is in memory. Now when that disk is booted, keep 
will be in effect and save will only function as an Applesoft cas- 
sette command. 

Another way to keep keep would be to put the four letter- 
change pokes in your greeting program. For example: 

]10 HOME: PRINT "GOOD MORNING, GEORGE." 
20 REM (REST OF YOUR GREETING PROGRAM) 

1000 POKE 43148,75: POKE 43149,69: POKE 43150,69= POKE 43151,208: 

REM (CHANGES "SAVE" TO "KEEP") 
1010 NEW: REM (OPTIONAL; ERASES THIS PROGRAM) 

Now, assuming this is your greeting program (the one that 
is automatically run when a disk is booted), the keep com- 
mand will be in effect when anyone boots this disk. When any 
"normal" disk is booted, the normal save command will be re- 
instated. 



Magazines 
of the Future 




One of the big hits of the Seventh West Coast Computer Faire, 
Softdisk Magazette is making a repeat performance at Applefest in 
Boston. 

This monthly publication entirely contained on a two-sided floppy disk 
has many of the regular features you expect to find in a conventional 
magazine. Stated simply, Softdisk serves its readership. The readers, 
in turn, help form the contents of each issue with comments and con- 
tributed programs. 

As many people learned in San Francisco, Softdisk is something not 
to be passed up. So far the reviews have all been good. 

Lucky folks in San Francisco also learned about Demo Disk, a two- 
sided disk that features short demonstrations of current software. 
Demo Disk allows you to preview software, everything from educa- 
tion to utilities and entertainment, in the comfort of your own home. 

Together, Softdisk and Demo Disk caused quite a crowd to form 
around the Softalk booth. We expect the same thing to happen again 
in Boston. Softdisk and Demo Disk will be offered together in a special 
festival deal. Bring two blank, two-sided disks and you can get your 
sides of electronic information for five dollars. 

Drop by the Softalk booth and you can see both products demon- 
strated before you decide to buy. If you don't have any blank floppies 
to spare, you can buy Demo Disk and Softdisk already on disk for a 
total of ten dollars. 

Never fear. For those unfortunate enough to miss both the West Coast 
Computer Faire and Applefest, you can get the premier issue of Demo 
Disk by sending $5 to: 

Demo Disk Publishing 

380 1 /2 Aster Street 

Laguna Beach, CA 92651 

California residents add 6% sales tax. 

Likewise, Softdisk is available through its normal distribution. Sub- 
scription cost for Softdisk is $10 for the first issue ordered and $5 per 
subsequent issues when the previous diskette is returned. 

To order Softdisk by mail, send ten dollars to: 
Softdisk Magazette 
3811 St. Vincent 
Shreveport, LA 71 108 

Softdisk requires Applesoft and DOS 3.3. A printer is desirable. 



MAY 1982 S Q E T A 

Changing commands can be handy for foiling would-be toil- 
ers of your programs. How can someone catalog your private 
disk if you've renamed the catalog command "popcorn"? 
Changing commands can, however, be a big pain in the chips if 
you forget what you've done! 

Load the DOS Snoop program into memory again. You can 
always run this program to check the current status of your 
DOS commands. For now, let's change Line 20 to reveal dif- 
ferent sections of memory. For example: 

20 FOR X = 43380 TO 43581: REM (DOS error messages) 

20 FOR X = 45991 TO 45994: REM (catalog file-type codes) 

20 FOR X = 46010 TO 45999 STEP -1: REM (disk volume heading) 

Notice how error messages are set up like commands, with the 
last letter having a high- byte value. Normal (as opposed to in- 
verse or flashing) file codes and disk volume headings, how- 
ever, are made of only high-byte characters. 

While we've got DOS Snoop loaded, we might as well take a 
peek at good old Applesoft's vocabulary too, even though we 
can't change it. Change Line 20 in the DOS Snoop program to: 

20 FOR X = 53456 TO 54116 

Go ahead and try to poke some changes into Applesoft. It can't 
be done because Applesoft is in hardware (ROM) , unlike DOS, 
which is loaded from software (disk) into changeable memory 
(RAM). If you poke 53456,0 and then print peek (53456) , you 
don't get a zero, but a 69, because 53456 is a location in "read- 
only" memory. 

Back to DOS: The two programs that follow are quite good 
at saying what I've been trying to get across. Give these little 
utilities a try and analyze what they do. They'll both dress up 
your catalog presentations while you're at it. 

A Catalog Titler. This first program will change the disk 
volume heading to any title you want and give you the option of 
printing or not printing the volume number itself. There's ap- 
parently no way to change the actual disk volume, but this pro- 
gram will at least let you fake the change by making any num- 
ber you want part of your heading!

Catalog Re-Bait! This program lets you rename your cata- 
log's binary, Applesoft, Integer, and text file-type codes (B, A, 
I, and T) as well as the locked code (asterisk) and unlocked 
code (space) to any normal typable text character. Remem- 
ber, these changes are in RAM only and must be saved by ini- 
tializing a new disk, so that when that new disk is booted the 
changes will take effect.

GOTO 40 

PRINT CHR$ (192); CATALOG. Another easy-to-poke 
change, of questionable value, is DOS's control-D command 
character. Normally, to execute a DOS command such as 
catalog from within a program, you would type: 

10 PRINT "[control-d]CATALOG" : REM (INVISIBLE control-D) 

The control-D is invisible between the first quote mark and the 
word catalog. If you want, you could change the control-D to a 
visible character like You can peek at DOS's command 
character by typing: 

PRINT PEEK(43698) 

This will normally produce a 132, the high-byte value for con- 
trol-D. Change it to the high-byte value for "@" (192) by typ- 
ing: 



50 

60

220 
230 



POKE 43698,ASC("@") + 128 

Now you can catalog with: 

10 PRINT "©CATALOG": REM (ALL VISIBLE) 

All the changes we have been making are handy if you are into 
creating your own modified DOS and perhaps interested in dis- 
guising your programs. Remember, though, when changing 
commands, that any time a normal DOS command is encoun- 
tered in a program, it will be unrecognized and unexecuted, 
presenting you with (if you haven't changed it too) a "syntax 
error" (DOS's version with no question mark) . Other changes, 
like custom file codes, should cause no problem. 

ASCII Chart. In case you don't have a high-byte/low-byte 
ASCII reference chart, here's a program that will write one for 
you. Jazz it up a bit, if you want, to make it print in two or four 
columns. If you don't have a lower-case chip in your Apple, 
characters above ASCII 96 (224) won't print correctly on your 
screen, but should appear as intended on your printer.

80 NEXT: TEXT: VTAB 23: END 

Mystery of the Month. This one isn't really a DOS mystery, 
but it's another one (in a long series) that many of us can't an- 
swer: Suppose you want to turn your printer on from within a 
program, so your program does a PR#L Now suppose slot 1 is 
empty — or suppose your printer is off-line or just plain turned 
off. Is there any way to prevent your program from hanging or 
any way to print an appropriate screen error message? 

Meet you here next month with some adventures in read- 
ing and writing text files. So long.

BY PHILLIP COOD 



In the 1950s, parts of Silicon Valley, 
the center of the microcomputer indus- 
try today, were as arid and deserted as 
they had been in the days of the Spanish 
Grandees. ("And the lion still rules the 
barrancas, and a man there is always 
alone.") You could buy home-ripened 
olives in San Jose, and homemade Gren- 
ache Rose ($1 a gallon) in Saratoga. Mis- 
siles and space had something going and 
growing in Sunnyvale, but it was all be- 
hind barbed wire, so who could tell? Ice- 
land Stanford University was down on 
the farm. Menlo Park was a residential 
community just to the north of Stanford. 
Professor Shockley lived there. He was 
noted for his ideas about transistors rath- 
er than for his views on the separation of 
the races. 

The hillsides of South San Francisco 
were covered with houses — "They were 
all made out of ticky-tacky and they all 
looked just the same." Across the bay in 
Berkeley, they had won three Rose Bowl 
championships in a row, and women 
were not allowed in the fifty-yard-line 
rooting section. Toward the end of the fif- 
ties, three coeds infiltrated the reserved 
seats, the university backed down under 
pressure, and the critics prophesied de- 
cay and anarchy in the decade to come. 
They were right. 

The Sixties. The ticky-tacky spread 
down the hillside from South San Fran- 
cisco. Row houses and California-style 
motel apartments sprouted the length of 
the peninsula. The missiles and space en- 
clave grew larger despite an extended 
period of peace and cold war. There were 
periodic layoffs, but no matter how many 
men and women were discharged at the 
main gate, the company continued to ad- 
vertise for help in all the eastern papers. 
The aerospace workers didn't complain. 
If you lost your job in Sunnyvale, you 
could apply for another in Burbank the 
same day. 

Some folks made the move 
deliberately. They hoped the new job 
would be exciting and stimulating, the 
way they'd been promised at their first 
preemployment interview. But it never 
was. The kids adapted readily to the 
moves; the parents were never the same. 
Carly Simon recalls: "My father sits at 
night with no lights on, my mother reads 
her magazine, I hear her call 'Sweet 
dreams,' but I forget . . . how to dream." 
"Anomie," the shrinks sometimes called

it; "alienation." 

But the married people had it lucky. The singles had no way 
of making friends. Back home, everyone knew a dozen folks 
who could introduce you to a pretty girl you chanced to meet 
downtown. In the Valley, you didn't know anybody. Your co- 
workers went home to their wives and little league, and you? 
How the hell did you get married, if you didn't know anybody? 
How the hell did you get a date? 

One answer was the Midpeninsula Free University. 

At the Other End of the Universe. The outward revolution 
was in Berkeley. They had Mario Savio dancing atop the 
trapped police car and Joan Baez pleading for everyone to 
keep their cool. They had the confrontation with the Hell's An- 
gels at the Oakland train depot, and People's Park, and James 
Rector, blinded and dying on the rooftop. 

The inward revolution was in Menlo Park just to the north 
of Stanford. Menlo Park had the Midpeninsula Free Univer- 
sity, Baba Ram Dass, David Harris, Robb Crist, Vic Lovell, 
Mark Lane, four hundred courses, five thousand students, and 
eighty-four varieties of encounters: "Overcoming your fear of 
water," "Swedish massage," "Gestalt," "Psycodrama," and, 
"Hi, I'm Kathy Kirby, help me to know the real me." 

They tried everything at the Free U. If it worked, it got 
ripped off and commercialized at Esalen. Gestalt, total im- 
mersion, sensory awareness — they tried them all. Primal 
screaming went over big later in Beverly Hills. Menlo Park 
was the testing ground, and the rest of the country was the 
beneficiary. 

On the outer edge of Menlo Park (or was it Atherton?) the 
Veterans' Administration had a mental hospital. In the early 
sixties they started experiments with LSD. The drug proved ef- 
fective for the permanent reversal of depression, and the gov- 
ernment banned it. As Mort Sahl put it, "The AMA opposes 
chiropractors, LSD, and anything else that promises a quick 
nonprofit cure." 

Ken Kesey worked at the Menlo Park VA. So did Vic Lovell. 
Vic helped start the Free University. Ken had two reactions to 
his VA experience. First, he wrote a book called One Flew 
Over the Cuckoo 's Nest about mental hospitals and Big Nurse 
and the true nature of imprisonment. Second, he rode around 
the country dropping acid in other people's punch. 

By the seventies, Ken had dropped out ("copped out," some 
people suggested, implying that Ken had copped a plea in re- 
turn for some highly publicized antidrug statements). "You 
don't need drugs to expand your mind," Ken said. In a few 
more years, with the help of Shockley and Steven Jobs, we 
found out Ken was right. 

The Free University. The Midpeninsula Free University at- 
tracted a broad cross section of people of all ages and inter- 
ests. This was its strength and the source of its early successes. 
There were cult figures like David Harris and Baba Ram 
Dass. There were lapsed academics, full professors like Shock- 
ley and John McCarthy who thought a Free University might 
provide something a regular university could not. There were 
new grads, and old grads, and nongrads. There were aero- 
space workers, their spouses, and their runaway children. All 
seemed to know that success and life both required more than 
the "right" skills. 

The forerunner of the Midpeninsula Free University was 
the Woods Seminar, an informal gathering — wine and cheese 
and leftist conversation — that originated in the hills in back of 
Stanford. Among the Woods regulars and Free-U pioneers were 
Dennis and Mary Allison. Dennis was a computer program- 
mer, one of a thousand faces in the banks of engineers and 
secretaries they stockpiled at missiles and space. He became 
better known in the 1970s for his creation of Tiny Basic, the 
first of the microcomputer higher-order languages. 

Other high-tech types at the Free U included Bob Albrecht 
(later ComputerTown, USA), who taught Greek dancing; Jim 
Warren, Jr. (later editor of Dr. Dobb's Journal, organizer of 
the West Coast Computer Faire, and publisher of DataCast), 
who led an encounter titled "To Be Gentle;" and Larry Tessler 
(later with Apple Inc.'s advanced projects group), who taught 



a prophetic "How To End the IBM Monopoly." 

The most prominent of the high-tech types was John Mc- 
Carthy, then chairman of the computer science department at 
Stanford. While other computer science departments are still 
tucked away in mathematics or the business school, Stan- 
ford's department has borne that title since the late fifties. 
John is known for his work in artificial intelligence, a lan- 
guage — LISP, now available in Apple and Atari versions — and 
a bet he made in the 1960s. 

John bet British chess master David Levy that by 1980 
there would be a chess-playing computer good enough to beat 
Levy in repeated play. John lost. He should have made 1981 the 
target date. 

Living the American Dream. Despite the pretentious titles 
of some of the Free University courses, what the membership 
liked most was to eat, rap, smoke, lie in the sun, and have a 
good time. (They not only read about Hobbits, they were Hob- 
bits.) They rapped at council meetings, they rapped at week- 
end retreats, and they rapped afterward at each other's homes. 
They went for hikes together in the nearby redwoods or to 
Mount Tamalpais. They went to rock concerts in Litton Square 
or commuted to the happenings and the be-ins in San 
Francisco. 

Then, as suddenly as the summer of '67 had produced 
flower children and festivals and as '68 had produced the nomi- 
nation of Richard M. Nixon, it was all over. 

The Whole Earth Catalog. The seventies began with a 
whimper. Vic Lovell gave one last course at the Free U enti- 
tled "Returning to the Square World." He charged for the 
course. 

Larry Tessler wrote, "I'm getting so tired of being straight- 
ened out by encounter classes that I don't know what to do with 
the rest of my life. I think it's time to clean out my brain and 
start over. In this last Free University class, we'll go out to top- 
less joints, move to the suburbs, throw cocktail parties, bitch 
about our mates, buy suits, bras, makeup and the Ladies 
Home Journal, take diet pills, and get into alcoholism, insensi- 
tivity, and being uptight, bourgeois, frigid, and completely un- 
involved." 

For some the seventies were a new beginning. Steve Brand, 
an ex- Free University instructor ("Earth" and "Fire"), 
opened the Whole Earth Store around the corner from where 
the Free University had been. A catalog and a magazine soon 
followed. It was time for the greening of America, for getting 
back to the land in an Eddie Bean hat and an REI goose-down 
parka. 

Bob Albrecht stayed in the neighborhood, talking up com- 
puters. He even carried a PDP-8 in the back of his van. Final- 
ly, he opened a storefront, put in a couple of minis that anyone 
was welcome to play with, and called it the People's Computer 
Company. 

The PCC had a newsletter which became Dr. Dobb's Jour- 
nal of Tiny Basic Calisthenics & Orthodontia. Jim Warren, Jr., 
who'd edited the Free U's newsletter, took over at Dr. Dobb's 
in February 1976. "Our intent," Jim said, "is to promote the 
widespread dissemination of free and very inexpensive soft- 
ware" (his italics). 

Dr. Dobb's was not Jim's only computer-related project. In 
July of 1977, Personal Computing magazine's fourth issue re- 
ported, "San Francisco's Civic Auditorium was jam-packed 
with mobs of personal computing enthusiasts for two days in 
mid- April. Impresario Jim Warren announced attendance at 
nearly thirteen thousand. 

"The Computer Faire is the first of what promises to be an 
annual event. We predict the fun will continue year after year 
as excited newcomers do their own pioneering." The maga- 
zine was right. 

ComputerTown, USA. By mid 1979, Bob Albrecht, Ramon 
Zamora, and the People's Computer Company had persuaded 
the money men at the National Science Foundation that there 
was merit in personal computers and great merit in placing 
computers where ordinary people could use them, like the 
Menlo Park public library. The foundation responded with the 




presents:

funds to explore and extend the idea. ComputerTown, USA, 
was born. 

Can you imagine (as Arlo Guthrie might have sung in the 
sixties) a whole town turned on to computers — in the public li- 
brary, the boys' club, the high school, and the senior citizens' 
center! And not just one town, but a dozen towns like San Ber- 
nardino, California, Austin, Texas, Baraboo, Wisconsin, Bar- 
rington, Illinois, and Munchen, Germany! 

And in every one of these towns, groups of individuals met 
to coalesce, help each other, ask and answer questions, lie in 
the sun, eat, rap, and create an extended family /good 
time/party /be-in. 

Shades of the Free U ! Shades of Socrates and Plato and all 
that bunch! People helping people helping people enjoy. 

There were critics, of course: "And just what is a twelve- 
year-old child going to do with a computer?" 

And a reply for the critics: "Anything she likes." 

Keeping the Doctorates Away. You couldn't build a Com- 
puterTown with a brace of used PDP-8s and a hand-soldered 
IMSAI. It needed the development of computers that were less 
expensive and a whole lot easier to use. 

The first microcomputers were handcrafted marvels, with 
lots of switches on their front panels and multicolored lights. 
Mainframe programmers loved them because they so closely 
resembled the operator's console of a real — read main- 
frame — computer. Surprisingly, then and now, mainframe 
programmers aren't allowed near the operators' consoles of 
their own computers. Too much risk, or congestion, or some- 
thing. Since the late fifties, mainframe programmers have had 
to stand in line to submit their programs and, later, stand in 
line to pick up their results. In some instances, the closest a 
programmer comes to a "real" computer is a remote job en- 
try station consisting of a card reader and a line printer lo- 
cated a dozen miles or more away from the mainframe. 

To the programmer, a personal computer meant a com- 
puter he could feel and touch. He could flip that computer's 
switches and guide himself step by step through the thinking 
process. But for the noninitiate, the average man/wom- 
an/lawyer/doctor/businessman/corporate executive, the mul- 
tiple switches and lights were as much a barrier to computer 
use as lines and counters and a computer located a dozen miles 
away. 

The computer that Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak con- 
structed broke tradition in a number of ways. First they used 
the 6502 chip instead of the then popular 8080. The 6502 had 
block transfer abilities (a descendent of the 8080, the 25-80 
picked these up a chip-generation later) . Block transfer was an 
aid to constructing (and dissolving) high-speed, high-resolu- 
tion graphics displays. 

Second, they built with plastic. Like a bridge over troubled 
water, plastic touched a warm, reassuring, Barbie doll strain 
in the American character that cold metal could never reach. 

Third, their computer was easy to use. It came with Basic 
and a simple on-off switch, and you didn't need a year of Dr. 
Dobb's and regular meetings at a hobbyist club to figure out its 
use. Like the Free University, it was available to the broadest 
possible cross section of people. 

Fourth, the Apple was inexpensive. Elsewhere in the Bay 
area, at Cromemco and Kentucky Fried Computers (later to 
become North Star) , the accountants reasoned that when de- 
mand exceeds supply — chuckle, chuckle — one may charge 
what the traffic will bear. Jobs and Wozniak sold their com- 
puter practically at cost. 

Some manufacturers insisted on selling vertical integration 
packages — software, hardware, even a company magazine. 
Jobs and Wozniak had nothing but encouragement for the host 
of software and hardward entrepreneurs that flourished in 
Apple's wake. The Apple became a symbol for the laid-back, 
easy-going "Yellow Submarine" of the eighties. (And 50 per- 
cent of all sales went to major corporations.) 

Doing What Comes Naturally. The movements of the sixties 
all seemed to start in Menlo Park (or across the Bay in Berke- 
ley) , spread up and down the California coast, then bounce like 



long-range radio waves across the country from New York to 
Boston to Chicago, seeping into the rural heartland only years 
and years and years later, by which time smoking parapher- 
nalia was part of the Penney's catalog, and rock was 
rockabilly. 

The spread of the personal computer was far less depend- 
ent upon demographic considerations. As mail-order sales tes- 
tify, the personal computer is as much a part of country living 
as it is of big city ways. 

Of course, many of the folks who live out in the country 
moved out from the cities in the sixties. If it seems strange that 
they should be among the first to adopt the new personal com- 
puter, consider that most gave up their jobs with missiles and 
space not because they objected to working with machines, but 
because they objected to being treated as machines by bosses, 
co-workers, and an indifferent corporation. 

In the winter, when the snow lies deep enough that you need 
snowshoes just to make the trip from the house to the barn, the 
commodities market is no further away than a telephone call 
to CompuServe or the Source. Poor road conditions may fore- 
stall a ride to town to pick up the Davenport Times-Intelligen- 
cer or the Kalamazoo Gazette, but the electronic editions of the 
Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, and the Saint Louis 
Post Dispatch, are just a call away as well. 

The computerized rural farmer may know more about 
what's going on in town than the average city resident. There is 
so little to do in the country in the winter — apart from sex, seed 
catalogs, and watering the stock. There's plenty of time to sit 
back in an easy chair and flip through screen after screen of 
gossip columns and scheduled events ; there's time to sit back, 
keyboard in lap, legs propped up on the table, boot-shod or shoe- 
free (don't make no never mind) , wearing jeans or leisure suit 
(style is something for Sundays at church) , and think deep, 
electronically amplified thoughts. Though much of the person- 
al computer software comes from Silicon Gulch or the ex- 
tended San Fernando Valley, much comes from the back- 
woods too, from places like Coarsegold, California, White City, 
Oregon, Walled Lake, Michigan, and Darby, Montana. 

If you want to know what the people are thinking (the ones 
that voted for Truman and Nixon — first time — and Reagan) , 
listen in on CompuServe's CB; forget the letters in the New 
York Times. 

Free To Be You and Me. The movements of the sixties were 
met with harsh, repressive measures. The personal computer 
revolution has encountered no direct opposition so far. 

A few educators have spoken out against computers, but 
the majority have shown nothing but enthusiasm. The individ- 
ual school districts of the state of Minnesota have purchased 
more than three thousand Apple lis. Ditto the state of Michi- 
gan. And now both states have signed bulk purchase contracts 
with Atari. These computers are used primarily for student 
training. (Few, very few, are used for administrative func- 
tions, though that will change.) The students learn how to pro- 
gram as well as to read, spell, subtract, type, and Identify the 
states and their capitals with the aid of the appropriate Apple 
and Atari software. 

Fears of a generation of computer-educated kids who'd be 
intelligent but unable to make friends have proved ground- 
less. The computer, a nonjudgmental instructor, has helped to 
bring problem students out of themselves. Computers breed 
success, and success breeds confidence. Computers and confi- 
dence have paved the way to relationships as warm and open 
as any flashed on at a sixties be-in. 

The personal computer has had only a marginal effect on 
America's work habits. Dreams of working at home, exchang- 
ing work product, information, and money over the telephone, 
have proved elusive ; so much of work involves the exchange of 
emotional strokes as well as the exchange of information. Most 
executives can do without a personal secretary — at least since 
the arrival of the word processor — but they're unwilling to sur- 
render the prestige that a secretary and subordinates imply. 

A few entrepreneurs have made a living, a good one, the

From the left, first row: The maturity of the Apple marketplace was indicated by the snazziness of display areas of key Apple software companies. 
Participating in the booth wars were On-Line Systems, Sirius Software, Broderbund, Adventure International, and Gebelli Software. Dignitaries 
from nonexhibiting companies included BHI Gates of Microsoft, Rob Campbell of Apple, and Minoru Nakazawa of Star-Craft. Interesting were the 
software authors who took their royalties to start their own publishing companies. Among those in attendance were Nasir (Gebelli Software), and 
pictured in the second row: Mitch Kapor (Lotus Systems), Bob Ramsdell of Pansophics who joined with Kapor to form Professional Software Tech- 
nology, and Jay Sullivan of Hi-Res Football and Crossfire fame who started Calsoft. New faces on the scene were Steve Brightbill and Mark Capel- 
la of International Software Marketing, Jack Leonard who wrote Tax Beater for DataMost, Morgan Caffrey and Dan Fischer who wrote Doubletime 
Printer for Southwestern Data Systems, Gilman Louie who wrote Star Commander for Voyager, and Dan I llowsky who wrote Snack Attack for Data- 
Most. Bidding to become the next Snack Attack was Cavalier's new entry, Microwave. Third row: Many of the veteran Apple suppliers were present 
including Bob Clardy of Synergistic, Joel Billings of Strategic Simulations, Steve Baker and Bill Depew of Artsci, Barney Stone of Stoneware and 
Roger Wagner of Southwestern Data Systems. Some authors went public with their programs for the first time, including Andrew Greenberg of Wiz- 
ardry fame, shown here with customary front man Robert Woodhead, Bill Blue of ASCII Express and Z-Term fame, and Hal Faulkner, author of 
Broderbund's business packages. DataMost had two booths, which was none too many as the crowd at this one indicates. 






TAKE ME TO THE FAIR 



by Tonnv CEAK 



Fourth row: A panorama of the lower level exhibition 
hall. The blur in the center of the middle picture is Softsel's Bob 
Left. 

Bottom row: Other booths attracting lots of attention were Penguin 
Software and Syntauri. Creative Computing and Softalk again par- 
ticipated in the awards ceremony on Saturday. David Ahl made 
the presentation for Creative; Bill Budge got the readers' vote from 
Softalk. The fair wasn't all software; some of the peripheral crea- 
tors present were Roy Hicks of R.H. Electronics, Ted Gillum of TG 
Products, Jeff Mazur of Westside Electronics, and Dennis Hayes 
from Hayes Microcomputer. 



Crisis? What crisis? 

The event was the Seventh Annual West Coast Computer 
Faire, and these forty- five thousand people over three days — 
these new pioneers — had come to show, learn, sell, try, and 
buy wares for small computers. The aura that enveloped it all 
was wholesome, unsullied, hard-earned pride, and the closest 
thing to crisis anyone seemed to be experiencing was the 
struggle to see and take in as much of the event as possible. 

For the majority of fair participants, the notion of radical 
change was probably only a slight inkling in the back of the 
mind, waiting to be confirmed in scheduled keynote speech. In 
the meantime, people went about the business at hand. 

In the exhibitors' booths — some six hundred and fifty in all — 
publishers and manufacturers displayed and promoted their 
newest creations. Fledgling companies exhibited right along- 
side their larger, better established counterparts, well aware 
that these "giants of the industry" had been newcomers too 
just a year ago. 

Lured onward by the eye-catching presentations and the 
prospect of meeting the people responsible for products they 
had used and enjoyed, curious consumers made the rounds. 

Among the peripherals on display was a pressure-sensitive 
function strip for the Apple II from Videx that plugs into their 
Enhancer II and allows you to add sixteen programmable keys 
to the keyboard. In addition, Southern California Research 
Group introduced The Magic Keyboard, a device that can 
change the standard keyboard layout to DVORAK and other 
arrangements and, within the normal keyboard, assign keys to 
a ten-key keypad and sixteen-key hex keypad for program-

From the left, top row: Not everything went smoothly at the fair as this 
sign on the Huntington Computing booth indicates. But those who 
came a long distance seemed satisfied. They included Dave 
Culverwell of Prentice Hall's Brady Publishing, Terrapin's Jock Mc- 
Clees from Massachusetts, Penguin's Mark Pelczarski and Micro Co- 
op's Dave Albert from Chicago, Ken Jones from Advanced Operating 
Systems in Indianapolis, and Softdisk's Jim Mangham from Louisi- 
ana. Middle row: Other dignitaries included Dave Lingwood, an of- 
mers. 

A hardware/software package from Commsoft called the 
Photocaster lets you print photographs with the Apple. Inter- 
faced with a video camera, the system enables you to print 
black and white or color images, perform graphic manipula- 
tions and transmit the images via telephone. 

Strong emphasis on business software and utility pro- 
grams included the introduction of several program genera- 
tors for the Appple. 

Both hardware- and software-based solutions to slow print- 
out of files were presented. Practical Peripherals demon- 
strated a 32K buffer that eliminates this inconvenience, and 
Southwestern Data unveiled Doubletime Printer, a software 
solution that uses the Apple's existing memory capability in a 
new way. 

Some people were disappointed when they found that par- 
ticular products they'd been looking forward to seeing weren't 
ready yet. The absence of Apple Inc., said to be busy prepar- 
ing for the National Computer Conference, was nearly com- 
pensated for by the broad exhibitor and user support the com- 
pany received. Apple staff members roamed the fair, enthusi- 
astic as well. 

It is also worth noting that VisiCorp — then Personal Soft- 
ware — and Microsoft, both present at last year's fair, chose not 
to exhibit this time. 

Cutting a colorful figure, forsooth, Lord British appeared at 
the fair resplendent in medieval trappings. Wizardry authors 
Andrew Greenberg and Robert Woodhead played themselves 
and two characters they'd created for their game. They called 



ficer of Call-A.P.P.L.E. and Scott Hillman of Softsel. Hitting the West 
Coast as spectators were Ken Berry and Ken Leonhard from LJK 
Enterprises. Peripheral manufacturers who drew lots of traffic were 
Orange Micro and Corona. Third row: Lightning Software had plenty 
of callers, Vital Information of Kansas City was out in full force with 
Rolland Love, Gerald Van Diver III, Joe Stueckel, and Bob Scher- 
meister. Lord British in full regalia expounded on his forthcoming se- 
quel to Ultima. 

themselves Werdna and Trebor, and wore t-shirts so labeled. 

While microcomputer use in the areas of business, utility 
programs, and games was heralded on the exhibit floor, prod- 
ucts with an educational emphasis receded into the back- 
ground. The seminars that ran throughout the three-day event 
reflected a more even distribution of emphasis. 

The well attended keynote address was delivered by Dr. 
Seymour Papert, inventor of Logo. Unlike almost everyone 
else at the West Coast Computer Faire, Papert had a keen 
sense of crisis. 

In his speech, Papert elaborated on the fact that micro- 
computers are playing an increasingly essential role in our 
highly technological nation, and the impact of their presence 
will be felt even more intensely over the next twenty years. 

The consequent effect of new tools has always been the re- 
shaping of human relationships, of nations and economies, of 
ways of thinking, feeling, and perceiving. 

What can be learned from the past Papert concluded, is 
that our tools act upon us in a reflexive way, reshaping all fac- 
ets of our lives. How much more powerful and drastic will the 
reshaping be coupled with our use of the computer — an exten- 
sion of the mind itself. 

As individuals or as a nation, the critical element for our 
survival will be flexibility, to be willing to shift between differ- 
ent ways of thinking. And as we become more conscious of be- 
ing reshaped by our tools, we face a crisis of decision regard- 
ing the consequences of their use and their just application. 
This responsibility is a uniquely human one — one that cannot 
be shared by the machines we've created. Di

When Apple Speaks, An Overview of 

Who Listens? Speech Synthesizers 

BY MELISSA MILICU BY ALLEM MUI1KO 



Why would anybody want a computer that could talk back? 

The uses for speech are unlimited — anywhere printed out- 
put is used, a speech synthesizer can take over. You may have 
already heard some of these : the telephone operator in some 
major cities is, surprise! a computer to help with dialing in- 
structions. The Coca-Cola company has a new vending ma- 
chine that talks — a novelty that is bringing a lot of Uncola fans 
over to Coke's side. And some cars of the future are being out- 
fitted with cautious voices that remind drivers, "Please fasten 
your seat belt." 

True, Bell Telephone, Coca-Cola, and General Motors can 
afford more frills than the typical consumer. But if you're an 
average Apple owner who can't figure out how on earth you 
could use a speech synthesizer, then ask yourself: Do you play 
adventure games or have a hobby? Do you live in a house or an 
apartment? Do you frequently burn the oatmeal? Do you have 
a business? Do you occasionally oversleep and arrive late for 
work? Could you or your kids use extra tutoring in spelling or 
math? 

Speech synthesizers can be applied to all these ordinary liv- 
ing situations and predicaments, but they also have some ex- 
traordinary uses, so read on. They might work for you. 

Milo Street of Street Electronics, which manufactures the 



Computers on television shows almost always accept com- 
mands and queries given in ordinary spoken English and re- 
ply in the same colloquial fashion with a charming mechani- 
cal accent. Unfortunately, the machines that can both under- 
stand and produce the full range of natural language don't yet 
exist beyond the realm of Hollywood scriptwriters' imagina- 
tions. Considerable progress toward realizing this idea has 
been made in recent years, however, and a number of com- 
mercial products permit you and your computer to communi- 
cate by means of the most natural human communication 
channel — speech. 

Speech output systems allow a computer to speak. Speech 
input systems allow a computer to respond to spoken input. 
Speech output is one area in which products designed for 
microcomputers can compete in performance with products 
available commercially for the most expensive mainframes. 
In this article, we'll talk about such speech output systems for 
the Apple II. 

Speaking is the most natural human means of communica- 
tion. Spoken language is a communications system that has 
evolved over hundreds of thousands of years. Unlike writing, a 
johnny-come-lately technique with only a few thousand years 
of history, the human species and human spoken language

Speech Synthesizers 

have evolved together, and there is no more natural way than 
speech for people to express and understand requests, com- 
mands, questions, and new information. 

Technologies and Tradeoffs. Two primary strategies can be 
used to produce voice output from computers. The sounds 
made by the human vocal tract can be synthesized and com- 
bined to simulate speech, or an actual human voice can be re- 
corded, digitized, stored, retrieved from storage at playback 
time, and converted back into an analog signal. Both of these 
techniques are represented in the devices reviewed here. In 
order to understand how they work, we must first look at what 
is known about human speech. 

Speaking in a pressure-transmissive medium such as air 
results in vibrations that can be sensed as sounds. Sounds pro- 
duced by a speaking voice are not at a single-frequency (such 
as those produced by an electronic tone generator). Instead, 
the physical energy transmitted through the air during the pro- 
duction of each syllable of human speech is bunched into sev- 
eral tight frequency bands, called speech formants. The low- 
est frequency band is called the first formant, the second low- 
est the second formant, the next higher one the third formant, 
and so on. 

The absolute frequency of the first formant determines our 

When Apple Speaks 

Echo II, has identified four basic areas in which an Apple own- 
er could put a speech synthesizer to very good use: home and 
hobby, business and industry, education, and new strides for 
the handicapped. 

Be It Ever So Humble. Those computerized homes you've 
been reading so much about lately — the ones that have burglar 
alarms, light switches, cooking appliances, and lawn sprink- 
lers all tied into a central computer, are now also picking up on 
the advantages of speech synthesizers. 

The CompuHome company in Denver, Colorado for exam- 
ple, has some very satisfied clients whose computers give 
verbal output such as: "Your oatmeal will burn if you don't 
turn off the stove now." 

For a solar home, this might be handy on a sunny day: "It's 
getting awfully warm in here. Please close the drapes." 

Or how about a built-in burglar alarm system that an- 
nounces to your intruder: "The lady of the house has a black 
belt in karate. Please go away." 

Street was stuck with a big job when he was asked to name 
all the different uses for a speech synthesizer. "Nobody can 
possibly think of them all," he faltered. 

Well, how about replacing the recording on your telephone 
answering machine with the speech synthesizer robot- voice? 
You might even get more messages left that way. 

Another nice feature that no home with a sound sleeper 
should be without is a talking alarm clock with adjustable vol- 
ume and a variety of threats. The speech synthesizer can be 
programmed to say anything. 

Double Your Pleasure. Street also acknowledged that some 
computer games are becoming much more appealing with 
speech synthesizers. Voice input to warn players of monsters 
lurking in corridors and other adventure game dangers is be- 
ing used in some new games on the market, including the new 
hi-res versions of Scott Adams's original adventure series. The 
speech synthesizer feature can best be appreciated by hard- 
core adventure players who hate to be killed prematurely. 

Business After Pleasure. Street knows of a number of com- 
panies that have recently plugged a speech synthesizer into an 
Apple computer that was already at work. The addition of a 
speech synthesizer now allows the Apples that monitor oil drill- 



perception of the pitch of a speaker's voice. Vowel sounds can 
be discriminated on the basis of the relative frequencies of the 
first three formants; most consonants affect the transitions 
from neighboring vowel formants. A speech spectrogram plots 
the voice energy distributed across the audible frequency spec- 
trum over time. 

The contrastive speech sounds of a language (/g/ versus 
/d/ versus /t/, for example) are called phonemes. Each 
phoneme tends to have a characteristic shape in a speech spec- 
togram. The synthetic approach to speech production takes in- 
to account the formant shapes characteristic of each English 
phoneme. The shape and placement of the crucial first three 
formants for the sound /a/ are different from the shape and 
placement for the sound /o/, for instance. Synthetic speech is 
accomplished by electronically replicating the formant pat- 
terns associated with the different phonemes. 

Unlike synthesis techniques, digital recording techniques 
used for voice output from computers are not as dependent on 
the analysis of speech sounds. Instead, the total sound energy 
is sampled very quickly — sometimes at a rate of 32,000 times 
per second or more. The samples are then either stored direct- 
ly or subjected to mathematical compression techniques and 
then stored. Of course, if the samples are condensed they must 
be "reconstituted" at playback time. 

Each of these approaches has certain advantages and dis- 
advantages. The synthetic approach permits a very high ratio 



ing rigs at one American company to sound an alarm if a sys- 
tem overloads or encounters any other problem. And depend- 
ing on how the Apples are programmed, the computer, via the 
synthesizer, can let the operator know the nature of the prob- 
lem and how to fix it. 

Street pointed out that a feature such as this could save op- 
erators and engineers working in the field considerable time ; 
they would not need to be in front of the computer screen to fig- 
ure out the problem and could go to the trouble source 
immediately. 

If the computers were watchguard over a nuclear reactor 
when a leak occurred, Street said, those extra moments would 
be critical. He used the example of the reactor that nearly blew 
in the movie China Syndrome but emphasized he was only gen- 
eralizing about an important possible use for the built-in alarm 
system. 

Computers, unfortunately, have not yet been programmed 
to prevent disasters— that's still up to human beings. The role 
of computers, so far, has been to perform routine tasks, and 
that is their forte; but coupled with speech synthesizers, com- 
puters are starting to do some fairly creative things. 

Airline pilots are learning to fly with an Apple computer 
hooked up to a flight simulator control panel. When the novice 
pilot flies too low or banks too sharp in a turn, the speech syn- 
thesizer butts in and becomes the back-seat driver. Think 
about that the next time you're flying over the ocean. 

And what could be more down to earth than the use of a 
speech synthesizer for inventory control? A time consuming 
and always boring task, Street says some businesses could 
speed up this quarterly process by having the computer read 
aloud the numbers of items, category by category, by using a 
speech synthesizer. If workers didn't have to constantly refer 
to a clipboard, this would free their hands completely for veri- 
fying difficult items, such as counting a barrelful of nails in a 
hardware store. 

If the computer were programmed also to receive voice in- 
put, the worker could do the entire inventory without ever re- 
ferring to a clipboard: the worker tells the computer how 
many nails there are in the bin; if that doesn't match the num- 
ber the computer originally gave, that section can be Sagged 
so a manager can later resolve the difference ; and finally, the 
task completed, the worker can go on to count the bin of 
screws, alerted by the computer that there should be 7,693 Phil- 



of speech output to stored representation. Such systems use 
special circuits to translate ordinary text or phonetic codes 
into sounds. At present, however, the speech sounds produced 
by synthetic methods leave a great deal to be desired, in terms 
of naturalness and intelligibility. 

The digital recording technique results in quite intelligible 
speech (if the acoustic data is sampled at a high enough rate) . 
Its primary disadvantage is that the ratio of speech to storage 
is quite low. That is, each word to be spoken ordinarily takes 
up a good deal of RAM and disk space. Furthermore, all words 
to be uttered by the program must be recorded in advance ; the 
user cannot type in a word for pronunciation that has not al- 
ready been digitized and stored. 

Four speech output devices were tested with the Apple II: 
the Votrax Type'n'Talk, the Street Electronics Echo II, the 
Mountain Computer SuperTalker, and the Micromint Micro- 
mouth. Each of these devices employs a different speech out- 
put technology, and each has certain advantages and disad- 
vantages relative to the others. In the end, the intended appli- 
cation should determine the choice of speech output device. 

The Type'n'Talk uses speech-synthesis technology to pro- 
duce an imitation of human speech. It consists of a small, at- 
tractive box (matching the Apple in color) with a separate ex- 
ternal power supply. The user must provide either a speaker or 
a headphone set that can be connected to the Type'n'Talk' & 
acoustic mini jack and an Apple serial interface and cable. 

lips heads. 

People who need information fast, stockbrokers and race- 
track bookies, for example, can take advantage of a talking 
modem. It works much like a telephone answering machine. A 
client could call the Dow Jones or Churchill Downs computer 
(if there were one) and request information by punching the 
appropriate code through the telephone buttons. Statistics, av- 
erages, perhaps even the odds on the daily exacta could be 
theirs instantly. 

And advertising! Not that American advertising needs any 
help, but Street believes the speech synthesizer he used at the 
last West Coast Computer Faire helped bring people to his 
booth. He used the speech synthesizer to tell about the speech 
synthesizer— maybe it wasn't too original an idea, but people 
flocked to his booth just to find out where the weird voice was 
coming from. 

"A speech synthesizer is a great thing for demos at a show 
like the Computer Faire. People walk by and hear a talking 
computer and they want to see it," says Street. 

"Graphics and text alone don't make it when you can have 
a product tell about itself." 

The Real Thing. That's also the wisdom behind the new 
talking Coca-Cola machine that is currently being tested in a 
few localities around the country. People are dumping quar- 
ters in it just for the privilege of hearing it speak a very limit- 
ed vocabulary. 

Street says studies have shown that the quality of learning 
is enhanced by using speech in the teaching process. Speech is 
particularly motivating for young children, and computer hi- 
res graphics applied with speech interaction increases the at- 
tention span for very young students. 

Preschoolers are learning simple words in their first hour 
of reading. At UCLA, researchers are working with three and 
four-year-old children and Apple computers. A letter of the 
alphabet is flashed on the screen and the synthesizer pro- 
nounces it. If the child is learning the letter H, simple words 
like "hat" and "ham" are illustrated on the computer and pro- 
nounced by the synthesizer. 

Kids love the computers, says Street, since they don't need 
to know how to real to use one when a synthesizer is attached. 

"Computers aren't really threatening," he says. "They're 
r ot like an adult authoritarian figure sitting there and waiting 
for an immediate response. 



Don't bother opening up your Type'n'Talk box to see the 
goodies. Most of the crucial electronics are potted, and disas- 
sembling and reassembling the little unit is not an easy task. 
The Type 'n 'Talk has its own microprocessor, enough memory 
for an over-700-character buffer, a text-to-phonetics transla- 
tion algorithm, and the proprietary Votrax chip that provides 
format synthesis for speech production. Serial interface cir- 
cuitry accepts character input. 

The text sent to the Votrax unit is translated into speech au- 
tomatically, thus saving the user the need to learn an arcane 
phonetic representation for speech. When the Votrax gets a 
carriage return character, it says the text has been sent. 

The Type'n'Talk will work with any computer or terminal 
with a standard serial RS-232-C interface. To work with the Ap- 
ple II, the Type'n'Talk requires that a serial card be installed 
in one of the peripheral slots. Ideally, this card should be one 
that supports the full RS-232-C handshaking protocols, such as 
the California Computer Systems 7710 Asynchronous Commu- 
nications Card. 

This interface and the interface of the Type'n'Talk work to- 
gether to prevent data from being lost. With such a card, you 
can send data to the Type'n'Talk much faster than it can 
speak. When the Type'n'Talk'^ buffer is full, it tells the serial 
card in the Apple to stop sending data. Type'n'Talk then sig- 
nals when it is ready for more data. It is possible to use 
Type'n'Talk with a serial interface that does not provide hand- 



"Nope. Computers are completely patient. They won't yell 
at you if you get the wrong answers— unless you program them 
to do that." 

The kids are doing just fine without the yelling, however. Re- 
searchers report that children learn much faster with the com- 
puters than with more conventional ways of teaching. There are 
a wide variety of programs available for use with the synthe- 
sizer in other areas besides reading, including spelling and 
math. 

These same programs are being used for people with se- 
vere handicaps. Down's syndrome patients, for example, nor- 
mally have very limited speech. But the hi-res graphics cou- 
pled with the voice output acts like a biofeedback device. And 
the patient computer can stay with the handicapped person as 
long as need be for each word to be learned. 

Milo's Pet Project. Street is particularly interested in ap- 
plications for the physically disabled, and the speech synthe- 
sizer brings the world of computing closer to them. A special 
audio cursor allows a blind user to go to any point on the screen 
and hear what is on it. 

"This enables the blind to use word processors and data 
management packages. Most people don't think about it but 
the blind don't have a handy little address book or income 
ledger they can just flip out of a pocket and look at anytime 
they want," he explains. 

Street also points out that there are 1.5 million people in this 
country who are unable to speak for reasons ranging from 
throat cancer to cerebral palsy. "This opens up communica- 
tion for them. Without the technology we have nowadays, there 
would be no way for most of these people to talk — to say what 
was on their minds." 

No Voice Lessons Here. There may be four basic areas that 
synthesizers could be categorized into : home and hobby, busi- 
ness and industry, education, and special uses for the handi- 
capped, but according to Street, the uses for speech synthe- 
sizers are absolutely unlimited. As a matter of fact, they can 
do so many wonderful things, people aren't even complaining 
that their computers don't sound like Orson Welles or 
Katharine Hepburn. On the contrary — users like the mechani- 
cal, robotic twang with which their Apple pronounces words. 

"They don't want a human voice," explains Street. "Peo- 
ple say it's a computer, so it should sound like a computer — 
kind of science fiction. They think it sounds neat." Hi

THE SPOKEN WORD 




Man's Most Powerful Means 
of Communication 
Comes to Your Computer 



Until recently, talking computers existed only in the 
fantasy of science fiction, or at a great cost in industrial 
and university laboratories. Since then, speech units 
have appeared commercially in the $250 to $350 price 
range, but with little sophistication and potentially low 
speech quality. Voice Tech Industries has a unique new 
manual for the Apple and TRS80* personal computers. 
Utilizing our methods and commercially available com- 
ponents, your personal computer can actually speak. 
This product is unique in several ways. Our technology 
is the newest in the industry, the speech quality is su- 
perb, and you can build it yourself for under $50.00. 

The Voice Tech 30 page manual is both educational 
and informative. It describes how complex speech wave- 
forms are produced from the human vocal cavity and 
how these wave forms are electronically modeled. You 
will learn how advances in LSI semiconductor technol- 
ogy have enabled designers to put a digital model of the 
human vocal tract, a controller, and speech data on 
silicon. Complete, detailed instructions on interfacing 
speech hardware to the Apple and TRS 80* computers 
are given. (The manual contains a coupon through 
which you can order the hardware components speci- 
fied at a 50% discount). Also, professionally written 
software examples are provided that illustrate the fun- 
damental principles and techniques. 

Because speech is truly synthesized, the vocabulary 
is actually limitless. A common software interface can 
be shared among many different applications. Business 
reports can now be delivered verbally, educational pro- 
grams can communicate via sight and sound, message 
centers can audibly report, and the potential for game 
applications is boundless. 

Voice Tech has been in the speech synthesis field 



since its inception. Because of our unique background, 
we have produced a clear, concise, and interesting doc- 
ument that we are now making available to the personal 
computer market. After reading the manual, the hard- 
ware can be added to your system as easily as any other 
standard peripheral. Voice Tech stresses that all prod- 
ucts offered carry a full money-back guarantee.

shaking (such as the Apple Communications Card or the Ap- 
ple Serial Interface Card), but the programmer must then 
write timing controls to ensure that the Votrax has finished 
speaking before the next utterance is sent to it. 

No interface cable is provided with the unit, presumably be- 
cause RS-232-C pin assignments are different for different in- 
terfaces. In fact, the CCS 7710 card, the Apple II Serial Inter- 
face Card, and the Apple Communications Card each require a 
different cable configuration. 

The Type'n'Talk documentation provides some guidance 
for making up the cables, but the user is likely to discover that 
some alterations will have to be made. For example, both the 
CCS card and the Apple Serial Interface require that pins 2 and 
3 be swapped in the cable connector at one end or the other. 
Plan on spending a few unhappy hours experimenting to find 
the pin configuration that works for your interface. 

Once the Type'n'Talk and the Apple are physically con- 
nected, programming is simple. From Apple Basic, you just 
type PR#n (where n is 1-7) to send output to the serial inter- 
face card in slot n. In Apple Pascal, the serial interface card 
should be installed in slot 2, and the programmer should use 
the standard system I/O device volume REMOUT as the desti- 
nation for the text to be spoken. 

No special software is required or provided by Votrax for 
the Type'n'Talk. The programmer makes the unit talk simply 
by directing text output to the serial interface to which it is con- 
nected. Two dials on the Votrax cabinet control volume and 
frequency. 

The text-to-speech conversion feature of the Votrax unit 
makes it easy to use. The conversion algorithm, however, is 
imperfect. The English spelling system is not very con- 
sistent; the same spelling may have two very different pro- 
nunciations, depending on the meaning of the word. People 
know which pronunciation to use when they read the word in a 
sentence ("The North wind blew." versus Wind this band- 
age"). The text-to-speech conversion algorithm is not able to 



determine speech and meaning in the context of each word, 
however. 

Furthermore, certain words that look similar yet sound 
quite different — like dough, cough, and rough — are pro- 
nounced incorrectly by the Type'n'Talk. The solution to this 
problem is usually quite simple — just misspell words so that 
they will be pronounced correctly ! (Type in doe, coff, and ruff 
to get the pronunciations you want.) 

The Type'n'Talk also offers a phonetic mode, which is en- 
tered by sending the unit an escape sequence. In this mode, 
ASCII characters are interpreted as phonetic commands, in 
accord with a table provided in the documentation. Another 
Type'n'Talk option allows you to send text to the unit for con- 
version, and have it send back the phonetic codes to your Ap- 
ple. These codes can then be stored and later sent to the Votrax 
unit for pronunciation in the phonetic mode. If your Apple has 
a lower-case modification, you might also be interested in 
making use of an option that causes capitalized strings to be 
pronounced as acronyms, or strings of letter names. If this 
mode is selected, "IBM" is pronounced "I-B-M." 

Because the Type'n'Talk is able to pronounce (or, at least, 
try to pronounce) any text string, it is appropriate for uses in 
which the program author does not know in advance what 
words it will be called upon to speak. If, for example, it is im- 
portant for the user to be able to type in his or her name and 
later hear the Apple program say it, then an approach like that 
of Type'n'Talk is the only practical one. 

Unfortunately, Votrax speech is not very easy for people to 
understand the first time they hear it. If users have advance 
knowledge of what is being said by Type'n'Talk, then the 
sounds produced often seem quite clear. (Some sounds never 
seem quite right, however; /g/, for example, sounds more like 
a /d/.) Thus, if the message is written on the screen at the 
same time that it is spoken, literate users will understand the 
speech. If, on the other hand, a group of inexperienced listen- 
ers is asked to identify a Votrax sentence for the first time,

MACHINE LANGUAGE SPEED 

WHERE IT COUNTS... IN YOUR PROGRAM 



For the first time, Amper-Magic makes it easy for people who don't 
know machine language to use its power. Now you can attach slick, 
finished machine language routines directly to your Applesoft programs in 
seconds! And interface them by name , not address! And pass parameters 
directly, just like with Applesoft commands! 

You simply give each routine a name of your choice, perform the 
append procedure once at about 15 seconds per routine, and the machine 
language becomes a permanent part of your BASIC program; no more separate 
BLOADing programs! (Of course, you can remove any subroutine if you want 
to.) 

Up to 255 relocatable machine language routines can be attached to 
an Applesoft program and then called by name. We supply over 20 machine 
language routines on the disk. You can enter more from magazines. And 
more library disks are in the works. Some routines on this disk are: 



Binary file info 
Delete array 
Disassemble memory 
Dump variables 
Find substring 
Get 2-byte values 
Gosub to variable 



Goto to variable 
Hex memory dump 
Input anything 
Move memory 
Multiple poke decimal 
Multiple poke hex 



Print w/ o word break 
Restore special data 
Speed up Applesoft 
Speed restore 
Store 2-byte values 
Swap variables 



These routines and more can be attached and accessed easily. For 
example, to allow typing of commas and colons in a response (not normally 
allowed in Applesoft), you simply attach the Input Anything routine and 
put this line in your program: 

xxx PRINT "PLEASE ENTER THE DATE. "; : & INPUT ,DATE$

chances are none of them will get every word correctly. For- 
tunately, understanding Votrax speech is a skill that improves 
with practice. 

Comprehension is easier after about five minutes of ex- 
posure to Type'n'Talk speech. Applications programmers 
using Votrax output should consider including a simple tu- 
torial that gives users practice at understanding artificial 
speech output. 

At $375 list, the Votrax is the most expensive of the four 
speech output peripherals reviewed here. This price does not 
include a speaker or headphones, which the user must pro- 
vide. In addition, the effective cost to the user may be even 
greater if a serial interface card must be purchased for the 
specific purpose of controlling the Type'n'Talk. On the other 
hand, you can use your Type'n'Talk with other computers that 
have RS-232 interfaces. 

Type'n'Talk (and, as we will see, the Echo II as well) is an 
appropriate choice for applications that do not demand per- 
fect intelligibility but do put a premium on having a flexible, 
unconstrained repertoire of utterances. Very limited memory 
usage is another virtue of this device. 

Street Electronics Echo II. The Echo II uses a speech syn- 
thesis system that is technologically different from that of the 
Votrax Type'n'Talk but similar in effect. It consists of a print- 
ed circuit card designed to be placed in any of the Apple slots 
(except slot 0) . A mini acoustic jack at the rear of the board ac- 
cepts speaker or headphone plugs. Volume can be controlled 
on the card with a small screwdriver. An eight-ohm speaker is 
included, along with a floppy disk with a variety of utility and 
demonstration programs. The owner of a 48K Apple II with one 
disk drive needs to provide nothing more to make the system 
work. 

The workhorse of the Echo II hardware is the Texas In- 
struments TMS 5200 speech processor, the more advanced de- 



scendent of the speech chip used in the Texas Instruments 
Speak-and-Spell learning aid for children. An important dif- 
ference between the two devices is that the Speak-and-Spell 
chip (the TMC 0280) works with specially compressed repre- 
sentations of actual speech signals, while the TMS 5200 used in 
the Echo II works with the changing parameters of a model of 
the shape of the human vocal tract. 

The Echo II software system converts text into the appro- 
priate parameters, driving the hardware to produce a voice. 
These programs are provided in machine language on a DOS 
3.3 disk. A separately available disk offers software support for 
Apple Pascal users. 

The DOS disk offers three utility programs. The Textalker 
program, once installed, converts all text output for the screen 
to speech. A RAM card version of Textalker offers the same 
performance but takes advantage of the additional memory of- 
fered by an Apple language card or compatible 16K memory 
card, thereby freeing memory for the user's program or text. 

Special control-character sequences are used by Textalker 
to control absolute pitch, flat versus variable intonation, speak- 
ing rate, what pronunciation will be spoken, and output modes 
(talk only, print only, or both) . 

The third utility program is Speakeasy, a phoneme genera- 
tor that is also the core of the two versions of Textalker. Speak- 
easy lets the user program on a phonemic level, selecting 
every phoneme produced in an utterance. One can also select 
the stress on every syllable, the length of pauses, pitch and 
rate control, and volume control from software. 

In addition to the utility programs, the DOS disk includes 
five demonstration programs. Robot Demo displays a picture 
of a forbidding robot. Any words or phrases typed in are re- 
peated in the metallic, robot-like sound of the Echo II voice. 
Sec Demo is a similar demonstration, allowing the user to in- 
put text and then hear it. List Builder and Spelling Test are two 
programs that can be used together to prepare and present a 
spelling test. Finally, the Talking Typewriter demonstration 
simply pronounces any key (other than control or reset) when it 
is pressed ; this might be a very interesting way for very young 
children to become familiar with the letter names and the key- 
board layout. 

The Pascal disk for the Echo II offers only the Speakeasy 
utility, a documentation file on the use of the Echo II with Ap- 
ple Pascal, and a demonstration program. The demo program 
shows how to use the Pascal unit Vox, which provides the 
Speakeasy features, in a Pascal program. 

The Echo II documentation is a fourteen-page booklet that 
explains the use of the demonstration and utility programs. In 
addition, there are five appendices that show how to misspell 
certain types of words in Speakeasy so as to produce correct 
pronunciations, present the Speakeasy phonemes, give a sam- 
ple vocabulary in phoneme codes, describe the demonstration 
programs, and give a technical summary of the Echo II sys- 
tem and its utility programs. 

Using the Echo II is simple. Setup consists of plugging the 
interface board into one of the Apple's slots, plugging the sup- 
plied speaker into the jack on the interface board, and booting 
with a copy of the Textalker disk. The Textalker text-to-speech 
conversion algorithm is similar to the one used in the Votrax 
Type'n'Talk. As with Type'n'Talk, certain words must be crea- 
tively misspelled in order to obtain proper pronunciation. 

The Echo II has several other similarities to Type'n'Talk. It 
imposes a very small memory requirement on the system, 
making it suitable for applications demanding a great deal of 
memory for program or text. Speakeasy alone takes about 3K 
bytes; if Textalker is also used, then a total of about 8K bytes 
are consumed; this leaves plenty of program memory. Be- 
cause a text-to-speech algorithm is supplied, Echo II is appro- 
priate for applications in which novel utterances must be made 
at run time. Just as with Type'n'Talk, the system is not limited 
to utterances chosen by the programmer in advance of pro- 
gram execution. 

Echo II, like Type'n'Talk, requires a little practice listen-

VENTURES WITH 
VISICALC - 

BY JOE SHELTOH 



PERT is an acronym for Program Evaluation and Re- 
view Technique. In human terms, PERT is a graphical meth- 
od a project manager can use to help track scheduling, com- 
pletion dates, and critical dependencies of the many related 
activities that make up a project. 

CPM is an acronym for Critical Path Method. This term re- 
fers to the determination of the critical dependencies that af- 
fect the final completion date of a project. 

PERT and CPM were developed to assist in tracking and 
scheduling the myriad project activities involved in assem- 
bling a nuclear submarine. If you reflect for a moment on the 
complexities of such a project the need for a method that helps 
estimate and control scheduling becomes clear. 

Any complex project consists of a number of related activi- 
ties. An activity is an operation or task that requires an ex- 
penditure of time and resources in its accomplishment. Build- 
ing a house is an example of a complex project, while digging 
the foundation of the house is an example of a single activity. 

A PERT chart displays all the activities in a project and 
how they relate to each other. The chart in figure 1 shows a 
simple network that displays the construction of the main 
structure of a house. If you start at the first activity and trace 
the lines to each successive activity, you see a flow of depen- 
dency. As you follow a line, you'll see that any activity depict- 
ed requires that the previous activity be completed before the 
next activity is begun. In the example shown in figure 1, the 
foundation must be laid before the framework can be started, 
the frame must be completed before the outside walls and roof

Sample PERT Chart Figure 1. 

can be begun, and the roof and the walls must be completed be- 
fore the inside walls can be started. 

A simple PERT chart allows a contractor to see dependen- 
cies and to determine the number of days each activity takes. 
The PERT chart can then be used in scheduling the individual 
activities and as a means of knowing the expected completion 
date of the house. 

There are usually one or two paths through a complex net- 
work that are called the critical path. A critical path is the se- 
ries (or path) of activities that takes the most days to com- 
plete. If any activity on the critical path takes one day more 
than was allotted, completion of the project will take an extra 
day as well. If a project manager realizes that an activity on 
the critical path is going to take longer than was anticipated, 
the choice can be made to devote additional resources to that 
activity so it will be completed in time, or the schedule can be 
rearranged to reflect a later completion date. 



One more bit of information can be gleaned from a PERT 
chart. Most contracts require a final completion date for the 
entire project. The estimated completion date and the final 
completion date usually differ. The difference in these two 
dates is called project slack. This is "free" time — time the 
project can slip and still meet the deadline. In addition, each 
activity (with the exception of those on the critical path) has an 
activity slack. 

Enough of explanations. Here's how VisiCalc can be turned 
into a PERT chart. 

The first step is to determine exactly what activities make 
up a project and what their dependencies are on the comple- 
tion of other activities. For our purposes, we will first build the 
simple PERT chart shown in figure 2. 

| One 1 

Two Three 

I Four 1 

Figure 2. 

One is the first activity in the project. Activity one must be 
completed before either two or three can begin. Activity four 
cannot begin until both two and three are completed. If three is 
completed before two, activity four still can't begin until two is 
completed. Each activity will take a different period of time to 
complete. In order to schedule the project, we will assign the 
days in table 1 to the activities. 

Imagine you are scheduling this project. Without referring 
to the sample PERT chart in figure 2, try to determine the to- 
tal days this project will take. If you look at figure 2 you'll see 
how easy it really is to determine the completion time. Just 
add one, two and four, and one, three, and four. If only one per- 
son is working on each activity, the project will take sixty-one 
man days, but only 48 calendar days, to complete. The total 
number of calendar days spent on path one-two-four is forty- 
five days. The total on one-three-four is forty-eight days. If any 
activity on the one-three-four path takes longer to complete 
than shown in table 1, then the project will take that much long- 
er. Yet, if activity two takes one more day, the completion date 
of the project won't be affected. Path one-three-four is the crit- 
ical path. If two takes seventeen days, then one-two-four be- 
comes the critical path. Enough already. Let's build it. 

Boot VisiCalc. 

In cell B4 enter: ACTIVITY. 

Enter one, two, three, and four in cells B5 through B8. 

In cell C4: /FR DAYS 

In cells C5 through C8: 10, 13, 16, 22 

Next, we must determine a starting day for each activity. 

Cell D4: /FR START 

And of course, we need an ending day for each activity. 
Cell E4: /FR END

In D5 through D8 we'll enter the starting days for each ac- 
tivity and in E5 through E8, the ending days. The starting day 
for activity one is simple. It will start on day 0 (the day the 
project begins). Activity two will start the day activity one 
ends. Three will start on the same day. Activity four is a spe- 
cial case; we'll handle it later. 

In D5: 0 

In D6 and D7: +E5 

Now we'll fill in the completion days for one, two, and three. 
One starts on day 0 and should end on 0 plus the days it 
takes to complete the activity. 
In E5: +C5 +D5 

Replicate that formula into E6 and E7. The commands are : 

>E5 

/R RETURN 
E6.E8 RETURN 
RR 

The results are shown in figure 3. 

The end day for four is a problem. Does it start after two or 
three? Of course it should start after three now, but what if we 
change two to twenty days? Well, VisiCalc has an answer to 
our problem. 

Enter in D8: @MAX(E6,E7) 

The MAX function will take the larger of the two values. It 
will ensure that four starts after both two and three are com-

pleted because it will choose the maximum value of the two 
completion dates. Cell E8 shows that the project will take for- 
ty-eight days. 

Now we have a chart that shows the beginning and ending 
dates for each activity. We will use this to determine the criti- 
cal path. See figure 4. 

Critical Path. Our two paths through this PERT chart are 
one-two-four and one-three-four. We have already determined 
which is the critical path, but let's see how VisiCalc can do it 
for us. 

Move to BIO and enter /FR PATHS 

In CIO: /FR ACTIVITY 

In Cll : /FR DAYS 

In D10: /FR LOGIC 

In E10: /FR CRITICAL 

In Ell : /FR PATH 

Define the paths in B12+B13 

In B12: "1-2-4 (This is text!) 

In B13: "1-3-4 

Now we'll determine the total days for each path. 

In C12:+C5+C6+C8 

In C13:+C5+C7+C8 
VisiCalc has now figured that one-three-four is the critical path 
(see figure 5) because it has the largest number of days. If C6 
is changed to 20, one-two-four becomes the critical path. In 
actuality, PERT is a little more complicated than this, but

we'll see how that works later. We still have to fill in the boo- 
lean and critical path columns, but first let's graphically de- 
pict our PERT chart. 

In D18: ACT. ONE 

In C22: ACT.TWO 

In E22: ACT.THREE 

In D26: ACT.FOUR 

Graphics. In order to connect the activities graphically, we 
will use the graphic capability of VisiCalc. Move to D19 and en- 
ter: /F* 10. 

Look at the result. The cell is now filled with asterisks. The 
graphic mode will display any number by showing the num- 
ber as asterisks. If the number is larger than the available 
characters in the cell, the graphic mode will display the maxi- 
mum asterisks possible. Enter 2 in the cell and see the result. 
Enter 10 again and we'll continue to build our model. Enter the 
following commands to place asterisks into the cells that will 
depict our dependencies. 

Enter in C20, D20, E20, C21, E21, C23, E23, C24, D24, E24, 
and D25: /F* 10. 

We now have a simplified PERT chart. The asterisks show 
the lines of dependency. We're going to modify them in a while, 
but in the meantime let's think about the critical path again. 

Logic Operators and Functions. We find the critical path by 
determining whether the largest value is in C12 or C13. The 
logic column is where we'll determine the critical path. 

VisiCalc' s logical operators allow you to compare numeric 
values. If the comparison statement is true, VisiCalc will re- 
turn (display) true. If the statement is false, it will return false. 
Here's how it works: 

In D12: +C12 > C13 

In D13: +C13 > C12 

The first cell displays false. That's correct; 45 isn't larger 
than 48. The second cell displays true because 48 is larger than 
45. If you change any of the amounts in the days column so that 
one of the activity days becomes larger than the other, there 
will always be a true indication for the larger quantity. Visi- 
Calc will be able to look for a true statement in either column 
to determine the critical path. 

What happens if both values are equal? Both of the logical 
operators will return a false. In actuality, both paths are then 
critical. We need some method for VisiCalc to determine that 
both paths are critical. There is a logical operator that solves 
that problem. 

In D14: +C12=C13 

It shows false, indicating that the values in C12 and C13 are 
not equal. 

If you change the values in C6 and C7 to be equal, you will 
see D14 become true while the two cells above show false. Visi- 
Calc can now determine which paths are critical. We are go- 
ing to enter formulas in E12 and E13 that will determine the 
critical path. 

The formulas in each cell will have to be able to determine 
two things. First, is the cell to the left (D12 or D13) displaying 
true? If it is true, then VisiCalc should display a series of as- 
terisks indicating the critical path. If it is false, then VisiCalc 



should either display no asterisks if the other path is critical, or 
determine if both paths are critical. If both are critical, it 
should display asterisks. 

Sounds like a tall order, but it's relatively simple. The if 
logic function will return a specified value if the logic state- 
ment is true. It will return a different specified value if the logi- 
cal value is false. We can combine two if statements in E12 to 
evaluate the logic values in cells D12 and D14. Two more if 
statements in E13 to evaluate the logic values in D13 and D14 
will complete the task. 

In E12: @IF(D12,20,0)+@-IF(D14,20,0) RETURN /F* 

In E13: @,IF(D13,20,0)+@IF(D14,20,0) RETURN /F* 

That's all there is to it! Go change the values in C6 and C7 
and watch the results in E12 and E13; see figure 6. 

The first if statement looks at the value in the cell to its left. 
If the value is true (indicating a critical path) , it will fill the cell 
with asterisks. It will display no asterisks if the statement is 
false. Then the formula looks at the second if statement. It will 
evaluate the equality statement in D14 for true or false. If it 
sees a true, indicating both paths are equal (critical) it will re- 
turn 20 asterisks. If it sees a false, indicating one of the paths is 
critical, it will return 0 asterisks. Asterisks will only be dis- 
played if the cell indicates a critical path. 

We could actually have combined D12 and E12 like this: 
@IF((C12>C13),20,0) + @IF((D12 = D13),20,0). We could 
similarly have combined D13 and E13. Once you understand 
how to use the functions, you will want to conserve space in 
your templates by combining functions. Be certain you really 
are ready to combine functions first because, as you can see by 
looking at the formula above, it becomes much harder to spot 
where you have a problem. 

By now you might have wondered: if it is so easy to display 
the critical path graphically, why don't we do it on our PERT 
chart? Okay, let's. It will be almost as simple as replicating 
the formulas in E12 and E13. 

We'll start with the hardest part. Cells D19 and D25 should 
display asterisks no matter which path is critical. In order to

display the asterisks in those cells, we could simply enter 
+ E12+E13 in the cells that are used by both paths. That would 
display asterisks if there were values in either cell. But we 
don't want this to be too easy (although that's usually what 
you'll want to achieve). Let's try a little more complicated 
method that offers another chance to use if statements. 
The if statement to enter in D19, D20, D24, and D25 is: 

Ca:IF(D14,@SUM(E12...E13,20 

Let's see what we've done. The if function will evaluate D14 
for true or false. If it is false, we can assume that there are 
more days in one of the two paths and the formula will return 
the last value in the function: 20. If D14 is true, we only know 
that both paths have an equal number of days. There might or 
there might not be values entered in those cells. In either case, 
asterisks will be displayed. If you had summed E5 through E8 
instead of E12 and E13, asterisks would only have appeared if 
there were days assigned to the activities. 

If you haven't yet, enter the if function into the four cells 
shown above. Next, copy or replicate the formula in E12 into 
C20, C21, C23, and C24. Likewise, copy or replicate the formula 
in E13 into E20, E21, E23, and E24. 

We have now completed our very simple PERT chart with 
CPM (see figure 7). Because of forward referencing (which 
we discussed last month) , it will sometimes take an additional 
manual recalculation in order to ensure that the model is cor- 
rect. Try the PERT chart out. Change the activity days in C5 
through C8 and watch the critical path change. You will quick- 
ly notice that changes to C5 and C8 will not affect the critical 
path. That's because they are in both paths. Both paths will be 
defined by asterisks if there are no values in the activity days 
cells or if the two paths are both critical. 

A normal project will be more complex than the one we've 
just completed, but the principles will be the same. There will 
be a critical path defined by those activities that are critical to 
the completion of the project on a specific schedule.

Project and Activity Slack. Speaking of completing a proj- 
ect on a schedule, we should still discusss one other concept 
usually associated with PERT and CPM. As mentioned ear- 
lier, projects have a start date and an expected completion 




date. In addition, projects usually have a contractual date by 
when the project must be completed. In PERT terms, this con- 
tractual date is called the late completion date. If forty-five 
days are required to complete the project, and the contractual 
late completion date is fifty-two days, we can say the project 
has seven days of project slack. That is, the critical path com- 
pletion day can slip by seven days without extending beyond 
the contractual (late completion) date. 

Likewise, activities can have activity slack. Activity slack 
is the excess time that an activity can take before it becomes 
part of the critical path. In table 1, activity two has two days of 
activity slack before it becomes a critical activity. 

More Complex PERT Charts. We have completed a very 
simple PERT chart with Critical Path Management. Most 
PERT charts are much more complicated than this. The sim- 
ple logic functions we've used won't be able to handle a more 
complicated PERT because of the way we determined the crit- 
ical path. The PERT chart in figure 8 has just one more possi- 
ble path, and yet it is much more complicated. 

Next month we'll complete the PERT shown in figure 8, 
learn more about logic functions, and learn how to determine 
both project and activity slack. Your assignment, should you 
choose to accept it, is to complete the last PERT and then com- 
pare your answer to the one that will be given next month. 
(There's more than one way to do it. Good luck!) ill

This is the first part of a several part series on graphics and 
the Apple. The Apple has a lot of nice graphic capabilities that 
are not very difficult to use, but, as with any programming 
task, there are tricks that can help you take full advantage of 
them. 

Try not to ask "why?" too much when looking at some of 
the more odd conventions of Apple graphics ; it's easy to ask 
why now, but let's take a moment instead to appreciate the 
foresight used in the development of the Apple to include them 
at all. 

A couple of years ago, most "state of the art" games were 
done in the 16-color, low-resolution block graphic mode . . . and 
we were impressed. Who would have guessed that hi-res 
graphic games such as Raster Blaster were hiding in the Ap- 
ple, just waiting to get out, that long ago? Today, various 
graphic games on the Apple rival their big brothers in the ar- 
cades, and the capabilities for those were put there several 
years back. Amazing. 

The first sin has already been committed by starting to 
talk about the various graphic modes, even using an abbrevia- 
tion for one, before explaining what they are. There are two 
types of graphics built into the Apple. There's a low resolution 
mode that has sixteen colors, with the smallest unit being a 
block that's half the height and the same width as a text char- 
acter. (You, too, can use computer jargon now, by calling this 
mode lo-res.) In the lo-res mode, the screen is forty blocks wide 
and forty-eight blocks in height (text mode has 40 characters 

Making Binary Simple 

Binary isn't really very difficult; it's just awkward to use. 
In a way, it works very much like the standard base 10 system 
(decimal) , where each place stands for a power of 10. In deci- 
mal, the number 3,286 means three thousands (3 times 10 to the 
third) , two hundreds (2 times 10 squared) , eight tens (8 times 
10 to the first) , and six ones.

In binary, each place designates a power of two. The right- 
most place is 2 to the zero power, or 1. The next place is 2 to the 
first, or 2. The next is 2 squared, or 4. The next is 2 to the third, 
or 8, and so on. The binary number 1101 is equivalent to the 
base 10 number 13, since it means that there is one 8, one 4, no 
2's, and one 1.

across and twenty-four lines of type down the screen) . There is 
also a high resolution mode that uses six colors (the books tell 
you eight, but they count black and white twice each, for a rea- 
son we'll see later). The hi-res mode lets you access two hun- 
dred-eighty points across the screen and one hundred-ninety 
two points down (a single text character is made up on a grid 
seven points across and eight down) . It's the hi-res mode that 
most of these articles will discuss, since it provides much more 
flexibility with individual access to every point. 

There are several commands in Applesoft Basic that give 
you control over both hi-res and lo-res graphics, but before we 
get into things you can do with those commands, it may be a 
good idea to talk about how the graphics work internally and 
about some of the strangenesses you may encounter. It may 
also be a little backwards, talking about bits and bytes before 
using the handy-dandy, ready -to-go Applesoft graphic com- 
mands, but it will also answer a lot of questions before they 
arise, as well as convince some of the more advanced among 
you that this isn't just going to be a series of using hplot and 
shape tables. 

The hi-res graphics screen, 280 points by 192 points, corre- 
sponds directly to a portion of memory in the Apple. Every one 
of those points corresponds to a certain bit in memory and can 
be either on or off (lit or black). 

A bit is the smallest unit of memory in a computer, and it is 
the result of an electrical state that is in one of two positions. 
Mathematicians gave numbers to those two positions, 0 and 1,

Another example, you say? How about 1011011? 

2 2 2 2 2 2 2 

64 32 16 8 4 2 1 

10 1 10 1 1 

64 + 0 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 91 

So 1011011 in binary is the same as 91 decimal. 

In one byte you have eight bits (Binary diglTS) , and the 
largest number possible is every bit set (=1).

bers to the nice, familiar decimal variety.

and hence computers use binary arithmetic, which is base 2 
(as opposed to our usual base 10) . Eight bits in a group are a 
byte, and in a byte you can store the numbers 0 (00000000, each 
bit off) through 255 (11111111, each bit set). "Making Binary 
Simple" elaborates a little more on binary arithmetic, since it 
does come in handy when you want to do some tricky graph- 
ics, although if you sensibly stick to Applesoft graphics com- 
mands for a while, it's not really necessary. 

Memory consists of about 64,000 bytes (64K bytes) in most 
Apples. Each byte has a memory address that lets you refer 
to it, so you can store things in that location or look and see 
what's there. Unless you have an additional 16K RAM card, 
the top 16K of addresses have programs permanently stored 
there (the programs that make Applesoft and all the "little" 
functions, like reading keys and putting letters on the screen) . 
That type of memory is known as ROM, or read-only memory. 
The rest is RAM, or random access memory, in which you can 
store things and read things to your heart's content. That's the 
area where programs and data go when they get read from 
disk. 

Most Apples have 48K of RAM. The hi-res graphics screen 
corresponds to 8K of RAM, or 8,192 bytes (although only 7,680 
are actually used) . There are two areas of memory that can be 
used for hi-res graphics, called hi-res page 1 and hi-res page 2. 
The addresses for page 1 are 8192 through 16383, and the ad- 
dresses for page 2 are 16384 through 24575. 

What does this all mean? Not much, except it perhaps con- 
vinces you that there's an actual area in the memory of your 
computer that has a one-to-one relation with what you see on 
the hi-res screen. To illustrate graphically, here's a program 
that does nothing particularly useful, but does show you that 
there's nothing really magic about displaying graphics.

Hgr is an Applesoft command that switches the display to 
hi-res page 1 and turns off every bit in page 1 graphics memo- 
ry, thus clearing the screen to black. The poke command 
makes the bottom four lines of text disappear; more on that 
later. The loop defined at lines 20 and 40 says to repeat the 



statements in between with the variable L starting at 8192, in- 
creasing by 1 each time, until it reaches 16383 (conveniently, 
the addresses in graphics page 1 go from 8192 to 16383) . 

The statement poke L, 1 says to put the value 1 into the byte 
with address L. The result should be to turn on one of the eight 
bits in that byte, and hence turn on one point on the screen. The 
last statement switches the display back to text, so that you 
don't think your computer's disappeared into Never-Never 
Land. Actually, a good hearty reset after things stop happen- 
ing on the screen would do the same trick. 

Try running the program to see what happens. When you 
put the number 1 into all those locations, a bunch of points 
should light up. Try changing the 1 in the poke statement to 255. 
That should set every point. How do you get colors? Try using 
the numbers 42, 85, 170, and 213, which are various concoctions 
of every other bit being set (00101010, 01010101, 10101010, and 
11010101, in that order). 

The trick is that points themselves are either on or off. 
Color depends on two things: position and the leftmost bit. On- 
ly seven of the eight bits in each byte are displayed on the 
screen. The leftmost bit controls the color of the other seven. 
Bits in even columns on the screen are violet or blue when 
they're turned on. Bits in odd columns are green or orange 
when on. If the leftmost bit (high bit) is off, the colors are violet 
and green. If the high bit is set (on) , the colors are blue and 
orange. There is no actual white. When blue and orange are 
next to each other, they appear to be white ; likewise with violet 
and green. Hence, there are two different whites possible, and 
similarly, two different blacks (high bit on and high bit off). 

Try different numbers to see what happens. For those who 
want a challenge, try to find a way to poke in values that will 
make the entire screen orange or blue, and so on. The next 
article will deal with more conventional graphics commands 
through Applesoft before we eventually find our way back to 
bit graphics. HI

Merrltt's Mug. Many, many readers 
searched the February Softalk for a pic- 
ture of Jim Merritt, author of The Pas- 
cal Path, to enter in Merritt's Mug, and 
most of them found it. The mug referred 
to, of course (or so we assured Merritt) , 
was the coffee mug on the table in the pic- 
ture on page 151. Merritt was seated be- 
hind that table, looking (so two entrants 
mentioned) like someone had just stolen 
his Softalk. 

Full page ads, such as the one in 
which Merritt's picture appeared, often 



are not numbered. A few apparently 
young readers dealt with this by locat- 
ing Merritt on page 150, the number of 
the opposite page and the only page 
number on the spread. Since there was 
no picture at all on page 150, we credited 
these answers as correct. 

Winning depended on being the first 
correct entry from your time zone, and 
two time zones produced solo individuals 
whose postmarks beat all others from 
their zones. George Bass must have 
opened right to Merritt when his Softalk 
arrived in Williamsburg, Virginia; and 
Brad Handler probably played hookey 
from school in Denver, Colorado, just to 
get his entry in return mail. Mike Mor- 
ford (Ames, IA) and Steve Parkinson 
(Huntington Beach, CA) each had to con- 
tend with one other equally rapid re- 
sponder in the random generator. 

Each winner receives $25 credit at his 
local retailer. 

By the way, Jim Merritt, who had no 
inkling of the contest beforehand, also 
identified his picture correctly. It was, he 
said, the absolutely worst picture of him- 
self he had ever seen. Merritt, unfor- 
tunately, was too late with his entry to 
win any prizes. m 



Computerland To Go Fruitless? 



Apple Computer Inc. announced late last month that 
they were severing their contract with Computerland. In 
a letter to each Computerland franchisee, Apple presi- 
dent Mike Markkula explained that Computerland Cor- 
porate 's unwillingness to grant the standard location 
clause required by Apple was the cause for the dissolu- 
tion. 

The contract between Apple and Computerland is an 
ongoing one and the letter complied with a clause requir- 
ing ninety days' notice to terminate. Unless some rap- 
prochement occurs, that means that approximately 
July 19 all Computerland stores that are not directly rec- 
ognized as dealers by Apple will cease to have access to 
Apple product. 

The caveat "unless some rapprochement occurs" is 
advisable here. Computerland dealers contacted for 
comment seemed relatively unconcerned. Most cited a 
similar occurrence two years ago that was patched over 
and believed that Apple's current action was merely, as 
Max Cook of Computerland of South King County, Wash- 
ington, put it, "establishing a negotiating position." 

Fred Hoar, vice president of communications for Ap- 
ple, cited the olive branch extended to individual dealers 
in the letter. That paragraph encourages individual Com- 
puterland franchisees to apply for an Apple dealership. 
Hoar indicated that much of the screening process for 
new Apple dealer applicants will be waived for existing 
Computerlands. Several Computerland stores already 
are recognized by Apple as dealers. 

The crux of the impasse is control of the selling en- 
vironment. Apple seeks to enforce upon Computerland 
its standard location clause which allows Apple to nix a 
location too near an existing dealership. Computerland 
insists on the right to establish their franchises as they 
see fit. 

The issue is fairly crucial for both companies. Should 
Apple allow Computerland franchises to open at any lo- 



cation, it would tend to devalue independent Apple deal- 
ership locations. This has happened at least in Chicago 
suburbs and Albuquerque. 

In the Chicago area, Apple refused a dealer applicant 
who wanted to open near a successful independent Apple 
dealer. The applicant then made a deal with Computer- 
land and opened in the previously rejected location. 

In Albuquerque, the independent Apple dealer has 
been bracketed by Computerland and Micro Age fran- 
chises. 

Computerland, however, will be hard pressed no 
matter which way the negotiations go. If they accede to 
Apple's desires, they may be forcing new franchisees 
that carry Apple into less desirable territories or grant- 
ing desirable locations without the authority to sell Ap- 
ples, either way devaluing the franchise. If they elect to 
go without an Apple agreement, the franchise is likewise 
devalued by losing one of its two main product lines. 

Although the business relationship between the two 
firms has been rocky at times, each has contributed 
mightily to the success of the other. 

Just a day before Apple released its letter, a mid- 
western Computerland franchisee was musing on his 
good fortune, having both the Apple and the IBM to sell. 
Likewise, Apple overtook Tandy as the leading manu- 
facturer of personal computers largely on the strength of 
the Computerland merchandising network. 

There are no observers who are not saddened by this 
potential break. 

At the present time, the effect on the end user will be 
nil. But should the contract actually be terminated, some 
Computerland franchisees may have their supply of Ap- 
ple products cut off. All Computerland dealers contacted 
indicated plans to continue carrying products made by 
and for Apple, but Softalk readers should monitor the sit- 
uation carefully to ensure that their local Computerland 
will continue to support its installed user base. Hi

Speech Synthesizers 

from page 156 

ing before consistent understanding can be achieved; hence 
the Echo II may be more appropriate for the presentation of 
longer utterances — phrases or whole sentences— than for sin- 
gle words. Listeners automatically use the context provided by 
a sentence to determine the meanings of strange-sounding 
words that would be hard to understand if the system pro- 
nounced them in isolation. 

The Echo II is very easy to set up. It offers a low-cost 
means of presenting an essentially unlimited set of English 
sentences, although with imperfect intelligibility, and it im- 
poses low memory overhead. 

SuperTalker SD200. SuperTalker's technique for producing 
speech is very different from that of Type'n'Talk or the Echo 
II. Instead of synthesizing speech artificially, SuperTalker 
digitizes real human speech spoken into a microphone, com- 
presses and stores the speech, and later retrieves, decom- 
presses, and plays it back. As a consequence, SuperTalker 
speech can sound more like ordinary human speech. 

Two prices must be paid for this naturalness, however. One 
of these is memory consumption. Every stored word or phrase 
requires hundreds or even thousands of bytes of memory and 
mass storage. The second price is flexibility. The only ut- 
terances that SuperTalker can make are those that have been 
recorded by the programmer. The user cannot key in a novel 
text string and hear it said by the computer. 

Physically, the SuperTalker SD200 system consists of a 
printed circuit board, a microphone that plugs into one jack on 
the board, and an eight-ohm speaker that plugs into another 
jack on the board. In addition, the SD200 disk is provided with 
utility and demonstration programs. The disk includes a pro- 
gram called SuperTalker Test that most users will want to try 
first. It allows the user simply to record and play back a mes- 
sage. The program can easily be modified for experimenting 
with different volumes and digitizing rates. 

SuperTalker works by measuring the speech input at rapid 
rates. The user chooses whether to digitize the speech input at 
V2K bytes per second, IK bytes per second, 2K bytes per sec- 
ond, or 4K bytes per second. The digitized representation is 
compressed by means of a technique known as delta modula- 
tion, and then further compressed by coding repetitive pat- 
terns in the data. As a result, stored speech may require only 
half as much space in memory as the digitization rate would 
lead one to expect. This means that one second of speech re- 
corded at 4K bytes per second may require only 2K bytes of 
memory. 

For most purposes, only the 2K and 4K byte per second digi- 
tization rates are practical. Lower rates do not produce intelli- 
gible speech on playback. Reducing the digitization rate adds 
static to the transmission. Even at 4K bytes per second the 
speech can be somewhat fuzzy. There is no question, however, 
that this computer-produced speech is much more intelligible 
to the unpracticed ear than the two synthesis-based products 
previously discussed. 

One advantage of a recording technique such as Super- 
Talker's is that it is easy to produce speech with natural ex- 
pression. A second, possibly greater, advantage is that the 
technique allows the use of distinctive individual voices and the 
voices of both sexes. 

To use SuperTalker for applications, one must employ a 
two-stage process. First, a Vocal Preparation System {VPS) is 
used to record all the words or phrases that will be played back 
later, under program control. To use this utility, the program- 
mer simply runs VPS. A seventy-three page document, the 
SuperTalker Operating Manual, explains how to use VPS and 
how to access from Basic the phrase tables created with VPS. 
The new user will find it necessary to practice with VPS for a 
while before creating and editing phrase tables becomes

The memory requirements and intelligibility estimates given for the Mountain

natural and convenient. 

Because SuperTalker's primary strength relative to the 
speech synthesis products is intelligibility, the memory re- 
quirement comparisons made in figure 1 assume digitization 
at the maximum rate of 4K bytes per second. At lower rates, 
intelligibility and memory demands both decline. 

The demonstration programs provided include Talking 
Color Math and Accent. Talking Color Math is a voice-output 
version of Apple's original Color Math demo. Accent is a pro- 
gram that permits the user to develop foreign language drills 
using SuperTalker. In addition, Mountain Computer markets a 
separate disk with a spelling drill program. This is the type of 
application for which the SuperTalker is best suited. Only a 
few words need be loaded from the disk at any one time ; the 
memory requirements of the main program are not very 
great; and intelligibility is very important, because the words 
are spoken without context. 

SuperTalker is not ideal for applications that require that a 
good deal of spoken vocabulary remain in memory (because the 
delay of a disk access to retrieve the speech data is unaccept- 
able) . If the program must be able to accept and pronounce 
arbitrary English strings entered at the keyboard, then one of 
the speech synthesis products should be chosen. 

Micromint Micromouth. The Micromouth speech synthe- 
sizer interface is the only one of the four described in this 
article that does not have an unbounded vocabulary. Instead, 
the user is restricted to 144 "canned" words and phrases con- 
tained in two 64K bit ROMS. The payoffs, for those applica- 
tions that can make use of this restricted vocabulary set, are 
ease of use, virtually insignificant memory requirements, and 
very high intelligibility. 

Micromouth is instructed to speak by poking an address 
of slots 1 to 7 in the Apple II. Its heart is the National Semicon- 
ductor DT-1050 Digitalker speech synthesizer chip set, which 
includes the two aforementioned 64K bit ROMs and a speech 
processor chip. The ROMs contain compressed digital record- 
ings of the 144-item vocabulary. 

A comprehensive set of compression procedures was ap- 
plied to a digitized representation of each recorded speech 
item, in order to achieve the level of speech data packing pro- 
vided by this chip set. The equipment and algorithms used to

VISIC/^C models can be created using the VC PLUS program. Disk Emulation, 
Memory Master, and many application programs use these RAM boards. 

2. Legend Industries is dedicated to providing more programs that use the 
64KC AND 128KDE RAM boards. When you write a program that is used as a 
part of the product or is offered as a commercial product from Legend Indus- 
tries they will refund in full the purchase price of the board. This policy also 
applies to providing patches to commercial software so that they can use the 
expanded capacity of the 64K and 128K RAM boards from Legend. 

3. The warranty on the 64KC and 128KDE has been extended to 1 year. It 

has been a year since the 64K RAM board was introduced by Legend Industries.

produce these compressed speech representations are not 
available to the end user, so the programmer must make do 
with what is available in ROM from National Semiconductor. 

The speech processor chip effectively reverses all of the 
compression techniques originally applied to the digitized 
speech at playback time. It then converts the derived digital 
signal into analog output, which is amplified and can be heard 
over your headphones or speakers. 

Micromouth is instructed to speak by poking an address 
(which one depends upon the slot that Micromouth is installed 
in) with the number of the prerecorded item you want to hear. 
Item numbers are from 0 to 143. Poking with a larger value 
than 143 can result in some very strange sounds — you might 
want to try it. If two utterances are to be made in short succes- 
sion, it is necessary to make sure that Micromouth has fin- 
ished saying the first item before instructing it to say the sec- 
ond. This is done by peeking the address until it returns to the 
"ready to speak" value. Apple Pascal programmers canpofce 
and peek using a technique based on Pascal's variant record 
feature. 

Several features make it possible to produce utterances 
other than the basic 144. Certain of the vocabulary items are 
designed to be combined with others to produce new words. 
Kilo-, for example, has no pause after it, so it can be combined 
with gram or meter to produce kilogram and kilometer. In ad- 
dition, -ss is a plural ending that can be added to nouns in 
Micromouth's vocabulary. More possibilities are opened up 
when the programmer takes advantage of English homo- 
phony — the fact that many words with different meanings 
(and different spellings) sound the same. The word two can 
also be uttered to mean to and too, for example ; and four can 
be said for for. 

The 144 words and phrases encoded in Micromouth include 
the names of the letters of the alphabet, the numbers zero 
through nineteen, plus twenty, thirty, forty, . . . ninety, hun- 
dred, thousand, and million. In addition, some mathematical 
function words (such as plus, minus, and equal) and many ex- 
pressions of measurement (pounds, kilo, gram, minute, and 
others) are included. Other useful words, such as again, can- 
cel, case, check, control, dollar, down, have, higher, lower, 
left, right, ready, space, speed, star, than, time, and weight are 
also included. (All but one of the 144 vocabulary items are pro- 
nounced in a male voice. Item 0 is "This is Digitalker" in a 
clearly female voice.) 

This collection of utterances can be employed in a surpris- 
ingly large number of applications. A talking calculator is one 
possibility. A number of games could be designed that would 
make use of the fixed vocabulary. Of course, English text 
could not be read out loud by the device, except one letter at a 
time. 

Micromouth's clear diction and the low memory demands 
of the system may make it appropriate for a number of proc- 
ess control applications. Important changes in monitored proc- 
esses (such as pressure at crucial points in a steam power gen- 
eration system) could be announced vocally, in addition to or 
instead of a screen warning. 

National Semiconductor will produce new ROM chips for 
use with the Digitalker speech processor chip. Visually handi- 
capped programmers would benefit from vocabularies that in- 
clude the reserved words of programming languages such as 
Basic and Pascal. It would be an easy matter to have a pro- 
gram read aloud by an Apple with a Micromouth board with 
these ROMs installed. 

The Micromouth speech synthesizer interface is appro- 
priate for applications that require only the 144 words and 
phrases it provides. It produces very natural-sounding, intelli- 
gible speech, while requiring very little memory. Hi

Everyone's Guide to Assembly 
Language, Part 20 

In the preceding discussions of hi-res graphics, we've re- 
lied on the existing Applesoft Basic routines to do the neces- 
sary plotting of points from machine language. From your pre- 
vious experience with Applesoft and even from the last hi-res 
moving-dot programs presented, you may have noticed cer- 
tain peculiarities about hi-res graphics. The problems lie in 
certain intrinsic shortcomings in the explanation of hi-res 
graphics offered in this column so far. 

To explore this area further, let's examine, one by one, a 
number of problems that can occur — and thus discover the 
underlying structure of the hi-res display screen. 

Loading a Hi-res Screen: the "Fill" Effect. The fundamen- 
tal question to be answered in this discussion is, "How are indi- 
vidual points plotted on the screen?" It should be relatively 
easy to accept the notion that to display a screen whose ap- 
pearance can be arbitrarily changed, the RAM portion of the 
computer must be used. The area used is the range of mem- 
ory from $2000 to $3FFF (8192-16383 decimal). This is 
called the page one hi-res display. The Apple II is also ca- 
pable of displaying an alternate memory range, however. 
This is called, cleverly enough, the page two hi-res display. 
This display is derived from the data contained in the mem- 
ory range $4000-$5FFF. 

This article will focus primarily on page one, although for 
the most part, page two can be considered to be just a simple 
offset from page one. 

It should also be intuitively obvious that the display must in 
some way be linked to the actual contents of each byte in the 
ranges mentioned. This can be easily investigated by doing the 
following: 

From Applesoft Basic, select and clear the page one hi-res 
display by typing in: hgr. If the cursor is not still visible, press 
return until it reappears at the bottom of the screen. 

Now enter the Monitor with a call —151. The first thing to do 
is to fill memory with a sample value. Do this by entering the 
following: 

2000:FF 

200K2000.3FFFM 

When you press return, the screen should rapidly fill to 
white. Enter control-C to return to Basic. Let's save the screen 
now by placing a convenient disk in the drive and entering: 

BSAVE TESTPIC,A$2000,L$1FFF 

Besides providing the information on how to save a hi-res 
image, the purpose of this instruction was to allow you to 
watch the screen fill at a little slower pace. You may have 
noticed when you filled the screen just now that it did not fill in 
an exactly continuous pattern, line-by-line from top to bottom. 
It did happen rather quickly, though. 

Clear the screen by typing hgr again, and now load the data 
from disk back into memory by typing: 

BLOAD TESTPIC 

This time the screen should fill more slowly, and the some- 
what strange pattern this generates will be more apparent. So 
now our problem is: "How is a vertical screen position (line) 



selected in terms of its memory address?" (Or: "Why does the 
screen load in such a funny way?") 

Your first impulse might be to say "Well, if I were design- 
ing the computer, I'd just multiply the number of the line I 
wanted by the number of bytes per line to get the base address 
(the address of the first byte of the line) for the line. For ex- 
ample, if each line took forty bytes (which, by the way, it 
does), line zero would have a base address of $2000. Line 1 
would be $2000 + 1*$28 ($28 = 40 decimal) = $2028. Line 2 
would be $2000 + 2*$28 = $2050, and so on. 

An additional benefit would show up in the form of some un- 
used bytes on the hi-res page. For 192 lines, the last address 
used would be $2000 + (192*$28) -1 = $3DFF. Since we've allot- 
ted the area from $2000 to $3FFF for page one, this would leave 
$200 (512 decimal) bytes left over! 

Unfortunately, that's not the way the Apple was set up. It 
turns out that multiplication routines are kind of a drag in 
terms of speed and memory usage, unless you're using exact 
multiples of two. A much more compact (and faster) 
algorithm is:

Although it's not perhaps obvious how this works, the routine 
does take any value in the accumulator, from 0 to 191, and re- 
turn the appropriate base address of the corresponding line in 
locations $26,27 (GBAS). This code is "stolen" from a similar 
routine in the Applesoft hi-res routine HPOSN ($F411) men- 
tioned last month. 

The overall pattern to the screen filling operation is as fol- 
lows. The first forty bytes of memory correspond to line 0 of 
the screen display. The next forty bytes form line 63, and the 
next forty bytes line 127. At the end of the line 127 is a block of 
eight unused bytes. (3 * 40 + 8 = 128 bytes) . This pattern is re-

AMS 6000 

MEGABYTES SYSTEM 



The AMS 8000 Megobyrer System is for rhe serious user who wonrs to 
expand rhe capability of his Apple* by increasing online data storage, 
and reducing disk handling. It brings a new dimension to your Apple, 
making your data portable to other computers and gives you the re- 
liability associated with IBM standard 8" floppy disks. 

The AMS 8000 provides on Apple memory system with V2 to 4 4 Mega- 
bytes of removable, online, easy-to-use Apple formatted data ready 
to plug-in and operate. The system is at home in any setting and 
matches the styling of your Apple. 

The AMS 8000 preserves your current software investment by main- 
taining rigid compliance with APPLE DOS interface specificarions. Since 
standard Apple DOS commands are used, most software currently 
running under APPLE DOS3.2, 3.0, Apple UCSD Pascal 1.1, or Microsoft 
CP/M 2.2 will run with AMS 8000. Apple mini disks may be used at 
any time. 

Because of the IBM 3740 single density format, you now have rhe 
opportunity to exchange data with other computers such as IBM, 
INTEL, Radio Shack, DEC, etc. or operating systems like CP/M,* UCSD 
Pascal, etc. 

The controller circuitry utilizes a state-of-the-art LSI floppy disk controller 
ond data separator to provide automatic single and double density 
operation. A proprietary high speed SOFT-DMA data transfer tech- 
nique guarantees compatibility with all other DMA cards and will nor 
interfere with memoty refresh. 

For a cost effective, reliable, and software compatible memory sys- 
tem from rhe originator of 8" floppy disk systems for rhe Apple, try the 
AMS 8000 from SVA . . . SVA means Business.

peated sixty-three more times to create all 192 screen lines. (3 
* 64 = 192 lines; 64 * 128 bytes = 8,192 bytes per hi-res page.) 

When a hi-res page is loaded from disk, the range of mem- 
ory is filled sequentially from $2000 to $3FFF. What you see on 
the screen are twenty-four screen blocks, each consisting of 
eight lines gradually being filled. The twenty-four blocks can 
also be viewed as eight triplets, with the triplet made up of 
three lines, one line each at the top, middle, and bottom por- 
tions of the screen. The general screen fill pattern then is: 
0,63,127; 1,64,128; 2,65,129; . . . 62,126,191. 

It is not essential at this point that you be entirely fluent in 
terms of which line corresponds to which memory range ; only 
that you realize that the screen does not fill in quite the pattern 
that might otherwise be expected. Fortunately, the routine just 
given can calculate the base address of any horizontal line we 
wish to access. 

Problem 2: Shifting Colors. Type in the following: 

HGR 

HCOLOR = 1 
HPLOT 0,0 
CALL 62454 



HCOLOR = 5 

HPLOT 0,0 TO 100,100 

The first two steps are fairly innocent; they merely select 
and clear the hi-res page, and set the color to green. Trying to 
plot 0,0 gives the first problem : it doesn't seem to work. This is 
consistent with the warning given earlier, that even-num- 
bered colors only plot even coordinates, and odd-numbered col- 
ors only plot odd coordinates. Green, being an odd-value color, 
is not plotted at X = 0. 

The call 62U5U is a call to a routine that clears the screen to 
the last color plotted (whether or not the result was visible) . 
After you set the color to orange (hcolor=5), an attempt to 
draw a diagonal line produces a series of rectangles. What ac- 
counts for both of these effects? 

You'll recall that forty bytes per line are used to hold the 
data to display the 280 dot positions on each line. There are 
eight bits in a byte, indicating we have a total of 320 bits to 
work with. As it happens, only seven of each eight are used in 
mapping the displayed screen dots (7 * 40 = 280 dots) .

ment of each bit within the first three bytes of memory for the 
hi-res screen display. Although only the first three bytes of line 
0 are shown, the pattern holds for the entire display. 
Note the following major points: 

1. Not every color can be displayed at every X coordinate. 
Specifically, even colors (violet=2, blue=4) are available only 
on even X coordinates. Odd colors (green=l, orange=5) are 
available only at odd X coordinates. 

2. Within any byte, bit 7 is used to determine which row — 
top or bottom — is selected. This means that for any particular 
group of seven dot positions, represented by a single byte, only 
the colors in either the top or bottom rows can be shown at one 
time. For example, it is not possible to have green and orange 
dots displayed simultaneously within the same seven dot 
group. 

3. The order of the colors within every other byte is re- 
versed with respect to its neighbors. This is to ensure that the 
individual colors properly alternate with successive X posi- 
tions, such as between bytes 0 and 1, 1 and 2, and so on. 

The color chart is shown in figure 2. 

Now perhaps it will make a little more sense. Set 1 colors 
are all those selected with the high order bit off (bit 7 = 0). Set 2 
are all those selected when the high order bit is on (bit 7 = 1) . 

Any attempt to plot a point from one set will convert any ex- 
isting dots from the other set, provided all dots are defined 
within a common byte. Obviously, plotting a dot at X coordi- 
nate 7 (byte $2001) will not have any effect on dot positions 0 to 
6, since they are stored in a separate byte ($2000). 



White is drawn by turning on two adjacent dots, either a 
violet-green pair for whitel, or a blue-orange pair for white2. 
Conversely, black is formally done by turning off two dots at 
once, the pair of which would correspond to the ones used for a 
white plot as just described. 

Within a particular byte, bit 7 will always be left in a state 
determined by the nature of the last color plot, regardless of 
how many dots were previously in some other particular con- 
dition. This is why the diagonal line plot acted so strangely. By 
clearing the screen to green, every screen byte was set so as to 
have the green bits on, and the violet bits off (bit 7 = 0). See fig- 
ure 3. 

Location $2000, for example, would hold the value $2 A. Since 
the pattern is shifted for $2001, an all-green dot group would 
correspond to the value $55. To add to the confusion, remem- 
ber that figure 1 shows the bits in the reverse order from the 
notation normally used in this series of articles. Ordinarily, 
we'd show location $2000 holding a $2 A in binary notation as: 
00101010. Since the screen dots are displayed by least signifi- 
cant position first, though, this is reversed when showing a 
screen display, to make it easier to interpret: 

$2A = 00101010 => (reverse to match figure 1) => 01010100 

and for the other bytes: 

$5A = 01010101 => (reversed) => 10101010 

When hplot tried to draw an orange dot at 0,0 we would ordi- 
narily expect no effect. However, the high bit was reversed, 
and this converted the display of all current green dots to or- 
ange. 

At all odd coordinates the direct plot is successful, but all 
remaining dots in the particular byte are still converted to 
their high-bit-on equivalents. 

Figure 4 represents the contents of $2000-$2002 after the or- 
ange hplot.

Step through each statement carefully, noting what hap- 
pens after the attempt to plot the orange dot. In the first case, 
the first green dot is converted, even though the dots are vis- 
ually separated. This is because they are both determined 
within the same byte. In the second case, even though the sec- 
ond dot is not plotted, the conversion still occurs. In the third 
case, the second plot uses a second and distinct byte, so the 
first dot is unaffected, regardless of the color of the second 
plot. 

Other Problems: When Is White Not White? Answer: when 
you're only plotting one dot at a time. 

You may have noticed in the last few programs involving 
the movement of hi-res dots that at slow speeds the color of the 
dot alternated between violet and green, depending on its posi- 
tion. Similarly, even though we specified white as the color to 
be used in the box frame drawn at the beginning of each pro- 
gram, the left vertical line was violet while the right one was 
green. 

This is because white does not actually turn on two dots at 
once. What it really does is let either dot (violet/green or or- 
ange/blue) be acceptable for a given hplot. White only ap- 
pears when two adjacent dots get drawn, usually as a result of 
a line being drawn with some degree of horizontal tilt to it. 

In the moving-dot programs, the dot appears white when 
moving at higher speeds because the alternation between col-

ors occurs fast enough that your eye tends to do the blending on 
a time basis, rather than the usual positional one. 

Super Hi-res Graphics. The last topic for this issue is not a 
problem, but rather an unheralded benefit of this crazy sys- 
tem of screen displays. You may have noticed in the last ex- 
ample that when the second dot was plotted, the green dot 
moved slightly to the right when it changed to orange. Up until 
now, you've been led to believe that the violet/blue or 
green/orange options for each bit represented a unique screen 
position — a single dot. For the 280-point model of the screen, 
they do. Either violet or blue for example, can be plotted with 
an hplot 0,0 statement. 

In reality, however, a more accurate representation can be 
constructed as in figure 5. 

In this model, you can see that the high- bit-on colors are 
shifted a half position to the right of the high-bit-off colors. 
What this means is that you can plot points in a 560-dot mode, 
giving a much better resolution than the usual 280-point mode. 
This involves enough calculation that it's best done in machine 
language. Next month we'll investigate the techniques for plot- 
ting in all of these various modes using some new routines.

THE BOOK 



For months we've been telling you Roger Wagner's Assembly Lines: The Book is great. 
We've been telling you it'll make your Apple's 6502 jump up, spit in the air, and dance 
around like James Brown. 



J^C|^J|€f * But don't take our word for it. The author himself in the introduction says it more 

• ^B eloquently than we ever could. 

"This book does not attempt to cover every aspect of machine language program- 
ming. It does, however, provide the necessary information and guidance to allow even 
a somewhat inexperienced person to learn machine language in a minimum of time. 
* J You should find the text and examples quite readable, without being overwhelmed by 

technical jargon or too much material being presented at once." 

Loops, branches, COUT, paddles, addressing modes, the stack, shift operators, logi- 
cal operators: Wagner covers them all in Assembly Lines: The Book. 

* Wk $19.95 gets you more than 270 pages of graphs, listings, and exercises. Written in a

dash across the country, breaking down in Baton Rouge, hitch- 
hiking on and on across the land. 

Now here he was at the hub of an immense commercial 
venture, a cross between some sort of financial wizard and a 
labor exploiter in the garment district. Fritz still couldn't keep 
still. He strode the length of his office, fairly bursting with fe- 
line energy: "Layouts," "Stock options," "Take ten thousand 
OEM or buy out for half-a-mil," "Get me Fylstra," he hol- 
lered into his speaker phone. I'd gone through three levels of 
secretaries just to see his secretary. ("Not secretaries, man; 
market developers, sales directors. New titles for the new 
woman.") 

Fritz insisted on showing me his "people." We walked past 
row after row of beardless youths sitting before row after row 
of terminals like immigrant workers before their treadles. 
"This is my staff," Fritz said, "I give them computers and 
they give me love." 

Six telephones buzzed continuously, but no human an- 
swered them, only a Voc-A-Lyzer's synthetic voice. Young, 
scantily clad clerks roller skated up and down the aisles, pull- 
ing orders from the shelves — cassettes and disks and stringy 
floppies for the kinky trade. 

"Software is where it's at, man," Fritz hollered. He patted 
one of the video terminals. "You just sit down in front of this lit- 
tle screen, put a disk in the slot, the top of your head blows off, 
and they can't bust you for it." 

"Fritz," I said to him, "remember the sixties? Love in the 
park. Acceptance. All together now?" 

"Forget it, man; Neil and I do software. 

"Neil Cassidy," Fritz continued, seeing the incredulous 
look on my face. "He writes the software, and I sell it. Or rath- 
er I market it— distribution is the name of the game." 

"Neil Cassidy?" 

"Not here, man. Up in Oregon. Once a month we get a disk 
in the mail. Touch up the documentation a little, put three sexy 
girls and a hot tub on the cover. His stuff sells like crazy." 

"Three sexy girls?" 

"That's the general ledger package. Accounts receivable is 
the one with the two guys and the badger." 

Before I left, I tried one last appeal, an attempt at the elo- 
quence that had always eluded me in my own struggle for 
fame: "You don't belong in an office, Fritz. You belong in 
Winslow, Arizona: 'There's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford, 
slowing down to take a look at me.' You belong with Jack and 
Neil, out on the highway of life." 

But his pose was as rigid as a Tom in heat, and the dollar 
bills shone in his eyes.

How They Got the 

BIBLE 

on Disk 



BV DAVID HUNTER 



Before there could be cheap mass production of books, 
there had to be paper. The Chinese were the first to master pa- 
per making and the Arabs acquired the skill from them more 
than a thousand years ago. 

By the end of the fourteenth century a good method for 
making paper had reached Europe. The first printing presses 
followed shortly thereafter. Movable type pioneers Coster, Gu- 
tenberg, and Caxton, among others, brought the first modern 
books into the world. 

The mass production of books enormously stimulated the 
development of free discussion in Europe. Books were no long- 
er an expensive luxury that only the scholar and the noble 
could afford. The knowledge of reading spread quickly, and a 
new age in European literature began. 

Chips are to computers what paper is to books. Microcom- 
puters, like books, bring greater knowledge to the individual 
faster. Reading was welcomed half a millenium ago and mi- 
crocomputing is being greeted today as ways to better under- 
stand and shape the society we live in. 

It's inevitable that some of the knowledge found in the 
world's libraries find its way into electronic media. Comput- 
ers offer the chance to find, manipulate, and arrange data in a 
much faster and more efficient way than previously possible. 

Greatest Story Ever Told. Among the first programs to of- 
fer a complete text and the means to manipulate it on the Ap- 
ple II is The Word Processor from Bible Research Systems. 
The text is the King James version of the Bible ; storing both 
testaments calls for eight double-sided disks. Created by Kent 
Ochel and Bert Brown, The Word Processor runs on one or two 
disk drives and features database management character- 
istics that aid the serious Bible student. 

It is not surprising that the predominantly Christian so- 
ciety of fifteenth-century Europe required copies of the Bible in 



great quantities. The first bestseller, the Bible helped many 
people to learn to read. It is still one of the most widely read 
and widely studied printed works in the world. 

Initially a labor of love more than anything else, The Word 
Processor may have opened up a wealth of future applica- 
tions. There are a great many works spanning the ages of 
man ; most of them require intense study and would be perfect 
for manipulation on a computer. 

Unholy Matrimony. Religion and science have always been 
suspicious allies at best, but there's no reason why the two 
can't coexist in the same world. It would truly be disastrous if 
in our mad rush to escape our natural tethers we ignored what 
wisdom we have gained through the ages. The Word Proces- 
sor is a living embodiment of the new, preserving and improv- 
ing some on the old. 

Ochel and Brown may never be as famous as Gutenberg 
and Caxton, but their accomplishment is nonetheless very sig- 
nificant. They have enormously expanded the range of expe- 
rience you can find on an Apple by bringing books to the world 
of the 6502. 

Taking thirty-six million bits of data and compacting it into 
a marketable size is no small task. The average game seems 
like an afternoon's work in comparison. 

The creators of The Word Processor are both experienced 
programmers and have been on top of the latest improve- 
ments in computer technology. 

Kent Ochel was a programmer at IBM's T. J. Watson Re- 
search Institute during the sixties specializing in database 
management. Around the end of the sixties, Ochel went to 
work for the System 2000 Corporation. 

After a couple of years he moved over to MRI Systems, 
where he worked on a System 2000 product line and eventually 
became executive vice president. In 1978 MRI was acquired by

Intel. Not long after, Ochel was elected president of Intel sys- 
tems division, serving for almost three years. He resigned at 
the end of 1980. 

While at MRI, Ochel and his colleague Bert Brown thought 
it would be worthwhile to put the Bible on a computer. Unfor- 
tunately, there were no microcomputers as such at the time. 

Brown worked for NASA on the Apollo series, designing the 
database management system. He joined MRI at about the 
same time as Ochel; during the merger with Intel, he became 
product manager for the System 2000 line. Brown bought his 
Apple in 1979; he left Intel a year and a half ago. 

Looking for Consensus. Brown and Ochel bounced the idea 
of putting the Bible on disk off many people for several years. 
It was essential to determine what the program should in- 
clude, taking into consideration that many potential cus- 
tomers would be computer novices. 

The Bible is not a continually changing work, though it is 
occasionally retranslated, and this static quality makes man- 
aging the data easier. Ochel and Brown decided upon the King 
James version of the Bible, which hasn't changed in four hun- 
dred years. It is not copyrighted and it is still used by many 
Christians throughout the world. 

Ochel and Brown originally contemplated keying in the 
whole Bible from scratch, but soon realized that this task could 
take years. There had to be an easier way. 

They hit upon the idea of finding a computer tape that had 
been used to typeset the Bible for conventional book printing. 

The tape Ochel and Brown acquired was intended to run on 
an IBM 370, so they had to create an emulator that would make 
the Apple look like a terminal to the 370. This involved writing 
software that would allow communication between the IBM 
3805 controller and the Apple serial interface board. The cod- 
ing for the 370 conversion was the work of Brown. 

The transfer rate was of some concern since there are ap- 
proximately 4.5 million characters (36 million bits) of text in 
the Bible. If the transfer rate were only 300 baud, the move 




Sample text display from the Old Testament — Ezra 5:14-16. 

from IBM to Apple would require thirty-three hours. Ochel and 
Brown settled for a transfer rate of 2400 baud. The raw trans- 
fer filled forty-two standard five-and-a-quarter-inch disks. 

A Sea of Words. The tape transfer was one of the last things 
to be done in the creation of The Word Processor. Ochel and 
Brown knew that the raw transfer would result in an unwield- 
ly amount of disks and they had planned for this in advance. 

Ochel came upon a word frequency analysis study done for 
the Bible, and that helped immensely. It's nice to know, for in- 
stance, that the word the appears 63,871 times. There are some 
789,000 word occurrences in the Bible, comprised of nearly 
14,000 unique words. Twenty percent of all the words begin 
with the letter t. 

Eight-bit configurations were assigned to the most fre- 
quently occurring words. Analyses of letter sequence occur- 
rences such as ie, ea, ing, and many more were made and

eight-bit configurations were assigned to the sequences with 
the highest probability of occurrence. Ochel and Brown start- 
ed coding the assembly language program in October 1981 and 
finished in early January of this year. 

Everything they tried in order to compress the text seemed 
to be successful. Ochel and Brown reduced the storage re- 
quirements to a more reasonable 15 1/3 standard floppies 
(eight double-sided disks) . The compaction rate was approxi- 
mately one compacted character for each 2.5 original charac- 
ters. Not too shabby, when you consider that if every word in 
the Bible were compacted to a single character, those charac- 
ters would still require four double-sided disks. 

Not Bread Alone. Getting the Bible on disk in reasonable 
shape was one major aspect of the task, but you have to be able 
to do something with it. Spending several years gathering 
notes and impressions from computer experts and novices 
alike, Ochel and Brown developed the processing part of The 
Word Processor. Figuring that a menu-driven program will 
appeal most to computer novices, 6asic was employed for all 
the user input, and machine language routines were used for 
all the scanning and searching through the text. 

The Word Processor has many things in common with data- 
base management software. You can create indexes of any 
configuration you choose, offering the opportunity to improve 
on existing concordances. The indexes can be stored on disk 
and combined using boolean and/or logic. You can search for 
and highlight word or phrase occurrences. Scrolling through 
the teoct can be done several different ways, one verse at a time 
or much faster if you desire. A print program is included for 
printing hard copy of any selected Bible text. 

All the books of the Bible are given three character codes 
like IKE (1 Kings), EZR (Ezra), PSA (Psalms), and JOH 
(John). This takes a little getting used to, but it is more effi- 
cient than typing in the complete name every time. Since the 
Bible is so unwieldy by virtue of its size, simplification is the 
name of the game. 



Unfortunately, the simplification is so complete that some 
regular features of the King James Bible were lost. Usually 
this version of the Bible has each proper name, people and 
places, broken into syllables with pronunciation marks. Try- 
ing to read the Bible aloud without this feature can be difficult 
unless you know all the names by heart. 

Another thing missing is having the words of Jesus Christ 
printed in red. In many versions of the Bible key words in a 
verse are italicized; this too was lost in the translation. Minor 
things, to be sure, but they show where some improvements 
can be made in the future. 

Whither Thou Goest. The display functions of the program 
are fairly complete, offering a range of options that allow you 
to move through the text at will. Once you are in a book, you 
can reference a specific verse, hit return, and the program 
takes you right there. Likewise, the scan feature is quite 
handy. You can look for specific words or scan for a specific 
suffix or prefix. You can also scan for words via smaller words 
incorporated in them, like mankind. 

The text manipulation programs are all simple to use and 
offer no great barrier to understanding the program at hand. 
Creating, modifying, and combining indexes is equally as 
easy. Printing out hard copy of Bible text or lists of indexes is 
no more difficult than it is with the average word processor 
print program. 

By the end of January this year the whole thing was up and 
running. Brown and Ochel asked people in their local area to 
look at the product ; both experienced computer users and non- 
users with a strong interest in the Bible were asked to test the 
system. Ochel personally took the finished product to show to 
Walter Wilson, site manager of Apple Computer's plant in Dal- 
las . They received good feedback from the people who looked 
at the program and some improvements were made before 
marketing it. 4 

The price for The Word Processor may seem a little high to 
someone who is used to paying less than five dollars for a

Bert Brown and Kent Ochel, creators of The Word Processor and founders of Bible Re- 
search Systems. 

paperback book. Nonetheless, for many, $150 is not a barrier to 
owning a work of art, for instance, that has some personal 
value above and beyond its perceived value in the real world. 
Without a doubt, there is no other medium for the Bible that 
gives you the unique features found in The Word Processor. 

From the Outside In. Although pleased with their product, 
Ochel and Brown see some improvements and additions they 
can make to The Word Processor. 

Chief among these would be the inclusion of recognized out- 



side reference sources like Strong 's Reference Guide — a handy 
volume that takes every word in the Bible and relates it back to 
the original Greek. Another useful addition would be Nave's 
Topical Index — a volume that directs you to specific topics and 
where they're found in the Bible. A hard disk version of The 
Word Processor now in the works may include these 
materials. 

Ochel and Brown are also thinking about making other ver- 
sions of the Bible available, acquiring rights as they can for 
ones that are copyrighted. 

The near future may see all kinds of advances in miniaturi- 
zation. Ochel is confident that in five or six years you will be 
able to buy a hand-held device that has the entire Bible on it 
with a program much like The Word Processor. With all the 
bubble memory research going on at Intel, Ochel believes that 
by 1988 you should be able to get four megabytes of storage on 
a hand-held computer. 

For the moment though, the Bible on eight disks is basical- 
ly it. Brown and Ochel have big plans for tomorrow, but they 
are more than pleased with today. They feel they are provid- 
ing a much needed product, and so far they have no reason to 
doubt the success of their venture. 

The biggest seller in the history of publishing, the Bible is 
still the most important book in many peoples' lives. "I look 
upon the Bible as the manufacturers' handbook," explains 
Brown. "God built this world and the Bible explains how all the 
parts fit together and why." 

One sincerely hopes that other great works of world litera- 
ture will find their way into electronic media. Apples offer a lot 
as it is, but they could offer 'much more — the chance to get ac- 
quainted with our great and glorious past as inhabitants of 
planet Earth. HI

How the Old Campgrounds Have Changed 





BV JAHE (ANTILLOH 



It looks like a typical campground on a warm summer day. 
You see campers canoeing across the clear blue lake and hear 
children laughing and shouting as they play a rousing game of 
kickball. 

But listen closely. As you approach the cabin area, you hear 
a gentle clicking coming from some of the cabins. They're the 
computer cabins and their occupants are training in mental 
athletics. 

You've found your way to a computer camp, one of several 
that have sprung up across the country during the last two 
years. The kids have brought their swimsuits, their sleeping 
bags, and their software; they're ready to embark on a two- 
week adventure in computer learning. 

The New Frontier. One of the first camps to appear on the 
scene was Computer Camp, Inc., founded by Santa Barbara 
businessman Denison Bollay in the summer of 1980. Bollay 
first became fascinated with computers as a teen but became 
frustrated when he could never find a place to fiddle around 
with them. Years later, after a successful career with Fractal, 
a computer consulting firm that conducts research and devel- 
opment projects, Bollay decided to do something about his 
early frustration. Besides being a good business venture, com- 
puter camp is, in Bollay's view, "what America needs." 




Computer Camp, Inc., is run in a decidedly democratic 
manner. Campers, whose ages range from seven to sixteen, 
vote to determine the camp's curriculum. 

For most campers, the day begins with ninety minutes of 
class. A beginner seven or eight years old usually starts out 
with Logo, while an older camper ordinarily begins with the in- 
troduction to computers course. Every camper's progress is 
reviewed on a weekly basis so that classes can be reassigned 
accordingly. 

Among the classes are different levels of instruction in Ba- 
sic, including the introductory course and an intermediate one 
that deals with catalog functions, certain mathematical calls 
such as ABS, programming methodology, and the creation of 
group programs. Garry White, vice president of Computer 
Camp, Inc., explains, "We get a group of kids together. One 
person writes the menu, another the main part of the pro- 
gram, and the other group members work on the subroutines. 

"The kids have to communicate and collaborate as a team 
to accomplish the goal. It's at this point that we introduce the 
human factor into the process of programming. The campers 
are learning to communicate effectively the concepts involved 
in programming and technological processes." 

Finally, there's the advanced Basic instruction. "The ad- 
vanced group of campers do modular programming, using a 
sort of extended Basic, what you might call Basic-plus, which 
is a more modular design. They learn how to analyze the prob- 
lems and to understand and use step-by -step procedures. They 
can determine Basic algorithms of a projected program, im- 
prove them as they learn stepwise refinement, then carry this

into pseudocode and finally into a program." 

Computer Camp, Inc., also offers classes in electronics and 
in two levels of Pascal. 

In addition to being a place where young people learn about 
computing, Computer Camp is a camp, a place to play tennis, 
swim, hike, and generally enjoy the open spaces. There's also 
time for field sports and arts and crafts. 

One particularly unique and popular feature is the elec- 
tronically oriented crafts class. Members of the class make 
their own toy robots and the printed circuit boards to run them. 
The camp also owns a Terrapin Turtle, an upside-down-bowl- 
like robot that is periodically set up on an Apple II. Using the 
keyboard and paddles, campers can control the speed and di- 
rection of the turtle. 

There's also a games and simulations class. Here, the pos- 
ing and solving of problems involving ecological simulations is 
combined with nature hikes. 

After dinner, campers have free time — time to do home- 
work or to play computer games. They're encouraged to play 
games they have written themselves. "Therefore," White 
says, "the children write some incredibly advanced games. 

"We also have physical games to better understand con- 
cepts of the computer. Bubblesorts is a good example. 

"Two teams are chosen at random, and each member of 
each team must act out the actual programming logic for the 
team to win the game. The competitors play positions and vari- 
ables, holding and exchanging value cards. The kids who real- 
ly understand computers are the winners in this relay race. 

"Computer Camp has a balanced camp program, with op-

kind of camper. Left page, top: singing around the campfire; lower left, taking the

we do a gosub here and put in a routine. . . . 



portunities for personal growth in all areas — intellectual, emo- 
tional, physical, and spiritual." 

If children want only to learn more about computers, Garry 
White suggests that they attend any of the many summer 
schools that concentrate on computer studies. Computer 
Camp's goals are broader. 

"We want to get the children out of the classroom and into 
an environment that is more fun and creative. Studying the 
way our ecosystems work prepares kids for a world of calcu- 
lators and computers by really going to the meat of it. By study- 
ing nature, our kids are getting the big picture of things. Play- 
ing rewarding physical games and being grouped together 
on special projects helps the children grow socially." 

Surf and Software. The demand for computer camps has in- 
creased substantially in their two-year history, and Computer 
Camp, Inc., has become a worldwide phenomenon. They have 
camps in Lake Tahoe, California; Cape Cod, Massachusetts; 
and London, England. There are even two adult Computer 
Camps — one in Santa Barbara, California, and one in Mexico. 

Computer Camp for Adults began after the parents of many 
of the campers complained about not understanding what their 
children were saying when the kids told about camp. Many 
parents admitted another motive : they can't help wanting to 
share in their children's excitement about computers. 

Club Mediterranee in Ixtapa, Mexico, is an adult Computer 
Camp site that mixes a luxurious setting with an intensive 
computer learning session. The Santa Barbara site offers one- 
week sessions designed for executives, managers, and other 
business people who want to understand what microcomput-

ers can do for them now and in the future. 

How can your child — or you — get accepted to Computer 
Camp? "The only prerequisite," says Garry White, "is a de- 
sire to learn." The computer is a really great catalyst for turn- 
ing kids on, and bright kids find this an arena to excel in. 

Consecutive sessions for up to ten weeks of computer edu- 
cation are available from Computer Camp, Inc. Ages ac- 
cepted are seven to seventeen; cost is $795 per two-week ses- 
sion. In Santa Barbara the dates are : June 13 to 25, June 27 to 
July 9, July 11 to 23, July 25 to August 6, and August 8 to 20. In 
Lake Tahoe: June 27 to July 9, July 11 to 23, August 1 to 13, 
August 15 to 27. The East Coast and Adult Camp dates had not 
been confirmed at press time. Contact: Computer Camp, Inc.,

Go East, Young People. Across the country, in a little town 
called East Haddam, Connecticut, lives Computer Camp East. 
Dr. Arthur Michals, the camp's founder, has an extensive 
background in education and social work. Computer Camp 
East evolved out of the camp Michals originally created for 
learning-disabled children. 

"I became very interested in the work of Seymour Papert 
and his development of artificial intelligence and began look- 
ing into the potential of using Logo with the language-im- 
paired and handicapped. Through Logo and artificial intelli- 
gence, many learning-disabled people get a chance to prove 
themselves. It was when I understood this that I began to use 
computers in our programs." 

Computer Camp East was born in the summer of 1981, the 
natural outgrowth of Michals' previous success in computer 
education. The camp offers instruction in Basic by means of 
formal work labs and demonstrations, as well as advanced in- 
struction in Logo, Pilot, and Pascal. 48K Apple lis hooked up to 
color television sets, 32K Pets, and TI 99/4s with Logo and 
monitors are among Computer Camp East's permanent 
residents. 

Pre-teens and teens share in the fun of hiking, swimming in 
New England's largest pool, and other sports, but 65 percent of 
campers' time during their two- week stint is devoted to crack- 
ing the computer mystique. 

"We're the only school and camp that has a specific cur- 
riculum in computer ethics and morality," boasts Michals. 
"We have a discussion with youngsters about computer re- 
sponsibility — for example, about things like data banks versus 
privacy. We teach the children not to use the computer for ill- 
gotten gains or as an inappropriate way of obtaining 
information." 

Computer Camp East is just one of the locations operated 
by an umbrella organization, Computer Camp International. 
CCI is operating camps this year in Whitewater, Wisconsin; 
Denton, Texas; New York; and New Hampshire. In all these lo- 
cations, Michals promises a computer for every camper; 
campers won't be admitted if there aren't enough computers 
to accommodate them. With four two-week sessions of day and 
residential camp at each of its locations, Computer Camp In- 
ternational is capturing widespread attention. 

Computer Camps International has set dates for their Con- 
necticut, Texas, and Wisconsin sessions: June 27 to July 9, July 
11 to 23, July 25 to August 6, August 8 to 20. Nine- to seventeen- 
year-olds will be accepted at $795 per two-week session. Adult 
weekends at Banner Lodge in East Haddam, Connecticut, are 
June 25 to 27, July 23 to 25, and August 6 to 8. A one-week semi- 
nar/vacation is August 22 to 27. Prices vary. Contact: Com- 
puter Camps International, 310 Hartford Turnpike, Suite D, 
Vernon, Connecticut 06066; 203-871-9227. 

Room for More. With the success of the original computer 
camps, it's no wonder that the University of California at Santa 
Barbara decided to start a computer camp of its own. In con- 
junction with its Microcomputer Learning Center, UCSB is 
holding a ten-week residential summer camp for junior high 
and high school students. 

Established in 1979, the microcomputer laboratory has done 
innovative research on computer-based instruction for people 



at all educational levels. Campers — or students — are housed in 
university residence halls within walking distance of the cen- 
ter and the beach. 

UCSB is sponsoring five two-week sesions June 20 to August 
28 for campers ages ten to seventeen. Cost is $700 for two 
weeks. Contact: Diane Fairfield, CompuCamp, P.O. Box 20141, 
Santa Barbara, California 93120; 805-961-3818. 

Other computer camps are springing up across the coun- 
try. Purdue University will be holding camp for the week of 
July 25 to 31. They will be accepting up to forty campers, ages 
fourteen to eighteen, at $250 each. Guest speakers will be fea- 
tured. Contact Helene Baouendi, AGAD Administration Build- 
ing, Purdue University, West LaFayette, Indiana 47907; 317- 
494-8426. National Computer Camps will be holding a four-week 
session in Simsbury, Connecticut, July 11 to August 6, and a 
two-week session in Atlanta, Georgia, July 25 to August 6. Cost 
is $345 per week for campers nine to eighteen years old. 
Supervised computer learning for up to twelve hours a day. 
Contact: Dr. Michael Zabriski, P.O. Box 624, Orange, Connec- 
ticut 06477; 203-795-3049. For two two-week sessions, July 18 to 
31, and August 1 to 14, Marist College will be conducting a sum- 
mer science camp for campers ages ten to seventeen at $750 
each. Limited scholarships are available. Contact: Dr. Law- 
rence Menapace, Marist College, Poughkeepsie, New York 12601; 
914-471-3420, extension 245. 

From the look of things, computer camp is definitely not a 
trend that will fade out the way so many specialty camps do ; 
it's a wave of the future. Our leaders of tomorrow are apt to 
credit their experiences at today's computer camps for their 
sound bodies and sound minds — and superb hand-eye coordi- 
nation. HI

EZ-LEDGER 

EZ-LEDGER is the ideal record keeping system for somebody run- 
ning a small business out of their home or the self-employed profes- 
sional. EZ-LEDGER uses the simpleist form of bookkeeping 
possible. Single entry bookkeeping reguires only posting transac- 
tions either under INCOME or EXPENSE. 

EZ-LEDGER will keep track of expense items under any one of 99 
user selected tax codes plus keeping all year-to-date and monthly 
running totals for each of the selected items. Expense items may be 
entered under DEDUCTIBLE or NON-DEDUCTIBLE type codes. 

EZ-LEDGER is a strictly cash system, i.e. if you pay out monies 
(check, cash, credit cards etc.) then the transaction is posted under 
EXPENSE and if you receive monies then record them under 
INCOME. 

EZ-LEDGER will produce INVOICES with an automatically incre- 
mented invoice number and then automatically post the data to an 
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 'holding' file or directly to INCOME and 
update all totals. 

The accounts receivable and accounts payable files are 'holding' 
files with their own running year tp date totals. Transactions in these 
files may be automatically posted to INCOME or EXPENSE and all 
respective totals will be updated automatically. 

EZ-LEDGER will support 80 or 132 column printers and one or two 
disk drives. The printer is needed for producing invoices, but option- 
al on all other reports.

Assembly language is a programming medium ideal for 
applications where execution speed is critical. Such things as 
home arcade games, for example, are nearly always pro- 
grammed in assembly language. 

Assembly language is generally not, however, the medium 
of choice for the beginning programmer. Most newcomers to 
computing will want to start their programming efforts with a 
high-level language. 

Begin Basically on Multilingual Apple. There are a good 
many of these available to run on the Apple; Basic, Pascal, 
Cobol, Fortran, Lisp, Pilot, Forth, and Logo come to mind im- 
mediately, although the list could go on from there. Basic is by 
far the most popular language, with Pascal in second place 
and gaining. The next couple of installments of this column will 
focus on these two languages. 

When you see the familiar flashing box sitting next to the 
right-hand bracket, you are said to be in Basic. Now what does 
this particular bit of jargon really mean? 

It means that your Apple is running a program called the 
Basic — specifically the Applesoft Basic — Interpreter. To be 
just a bit more precise, the Apple is running a composite pro- 
gram consisting of the system Monitor and the Applesoft In- 
terpreter. 

It also means that it's your move; the Apple is ready to 
hear from you. 

Under normal conditions, when your Apple is flashing you 
the bracket and cursor, it's expecting that you'll communicate 
with it by way of the keyboard and that it will respond to you by 
way of your television or monitor screen. These conditions are 
normal in the sense that they are defaults ; they are the condi- 
tions that prevail unless you override them. 

But let's say, for now, that you choose not to override the 
defaults and that you're sitting at your Apple, gazing into your 
monitor screen, fingers hovering over the keyboard. You rap 
out a few keystrokes, and symbols instantly appear on the 
screen. It feels just as though you're working at an electric 
typewriter but seeing your work displayed on television. 

It's worth noting that that's not what's going on. In fact, 
some rather interesting activity is taking place to produce the 
illusion that you're mechanically placing letters and numbers 
on the monitor screen. 

Making the Complex Look Easy. Before you hit a key, the 
system Monitor is quietly doing its thing, displaying the Apple- 
soft prompt and blinking that little white box. As soon as you 
stroke the keyboard, you interrupt that soporific display and 
take the Monitor on a momentary excursion. 

The excursion has the following effects. The Monitor notes 
that a key has been pressed. It checks to see which key was 
pressed, and then it sends that information off to be stored in a 
certain location in memory. That location is part of what's 
called the keyboard buffer. 

At more or less the same instant, it sends the information 
about which key was pressed to another memory location, and 
that second location has the effect of causing a symbol to be 
displayed on your screen. Assuming all's well, the symbol will 
correspond accurately to the key you pressed and will appear 
in the spot where the cursor had been flashing. Having fin- 



ished that bit of labor, the system Monitor now resumes flash- 
ing, only it moves over one position so the cursor now appears 
to the right of the character you just caused to be displayed — 
or at the start of the next line, if your character happened to 
fall at the right side of the screen. 

As you keep hitting keys, you keep putting symbols on the 
screen and you keep loading information into the keyboard 
buffer. The keyboard buffer collects your keystroke data, stor- 
ing them all in consecutive memory locations. 

Eventually you may use up all the room in the buffer. The 
buffer, being one page (256 addresses) of memory, can store 
no more than 256 characters. If you hold down some number or 
letter key and the repeat key at the same time, you'll see that 
after you've run off a little more than six lines on the screen, 
the Apple will start to beep. It will beep after you've put 249 
characters into the buffer, and it will beep after each succes- 
sive keystroke until you've hit the 256th character. At that 
point the Monitor program will display a back-slash, dump the 
contents of the buffer, and signal you — with an Applesoft 
prompt and a flashing cursor — to start again. 

All the while you're making keystrokes, however, the Mon- 
itor is also checking to see if you've pressed return; if you do 
press return, something quite different happens. In that event, 
the Monitor takes the contents of the keyboard buffer and 
sends it en masse up to the high end of memory — to the do- 
main of the Basic Interpreter. 

Right of First Refusal Goes to DOS. To make the story 
more interesting, in many cases there is a sentry standing at 
the gateway to the Basic Interpreter; that sentry is DOS. If you 
happen to have booted a disk before engaging in all this key- 
board activity, then some form of the disk operating system 
will have been loaded into memory. And the disk operating 
system insists on scanning all data headed for the Basic Inter- 
preter. 

DOS, however, has a rather limited vocabulary, consisting 
of two dozen or so little words like init, verify, rename, and so 
on. And it only reads the first few characters in the stream of 
data going to the interpreter. As soon as it finds a sequence of 
characters that doesn't correspond to a word in its vocabulary, 
it gives up and sends the stuff on to the interpreter. So if you hit 
return after typing verity when you mean verify, DOS will 
read the first five characters and then yield the entire word to 
Basic. 

If DOS gets a whole word that it understands, it keeps the 
word, treats it as a disk command, and attempts to carry out 
the command. Basic, in that event, never sees the command. 

If the contents of the buffer do reach the Basic Interpreter, 
here's what happens. Basic first attempts to parse the line 
you've given it. What that means is that it scans everything up 
to your return code and organizes it into units that it recog- 
nizes and understands. What happens next depends on the in- 
itial characters of your input. 

How Apple Digests What You Feed It. If your line started 
with anything other than a number, Basic will attempt to in- 
terpret your line — it will try to translate it into the form of 
binary code that the 6502 can execute. If all's gone well and 
your line of input meets all the syntax requirements of the

Basic Interpreter, the translation will be successful and the 
6502 will execute whatever commands you've specified. If 
you've typed print 2 + 2, for example, you'll see the number 4 
appear on your screen. 

If, on the other hand, you've given it something indiges- 
tible, like paint 2 + 2, the interpreter will be unable to trans- 
late your request and hence the 6502 will be unable to execute 
it. The interpreter's stock procedure in such events is to issue 
the message "?syntax error" and to cause the speaker to beep. 

Causing the 6502 to execute a command by way of the Basic 
Interpreter as soon as you hit return is sometimes described as 
operating in the direct or immediate execution mode. Most of 
Basic's command vocabulary can be used in this fashion. 

If, for example, you just type input A and hit return, you're 
issuing a perfectly legal Basic command but using it in the 
wrong context. In this case your syntax is fine, so you don't get 
a syntax error message. Instead the interpreter actually does 
start to execute your command — it puts a question mark on the 
screen, which is one of the things it does for an input command 
in the appropriate context — but then it balks and gives you the 
message "Illegal direct error." 

If the line that goes to the Basic Interpreter starts with a 
number, something entirely different happens. The interpret- 
er parses your line as before, but it doesn't make the transla- 
tion into 6502 code. Instead it stores your parsed line in a region 
of memory beginning with address 2048. If you type some more 
lines that start with numbers, the interpreter will treat all of 
them this way, but it will store them in memory in a numeri- 
cally ordered fashion, regardless of the order in which you en- 
ter them. That is to say, you can type lines starting with, for ex- 
ample, 30, 90, 10, and 75, and the interpreter will tuck them all 
into memory in ascending order. 

Later on at some point, should you wish to see these lines 
executed, you can type the comand run, and the interpreter 
will pick them back up from memory, translate them, and 
send them off to be executed — one at a time, in ascending 



numerical order. 

This sort of activity is known as deferred execution. It's 
also called programming. A series of instructions starting with 
line numbers constitutes a program in Basic. 

When Out of Order Is Okay. To be a little more exact, the in- 
terpreter starts program execution with the lowest-numbered 
line and proceeds in ascending order until some line directs it 
to do otherwise. Basic's vocabulary includes a goto command, 
by which a programmer can alter the order in which a pro- 
gram would otherwise be executed. 

For example, if a program contained the instruction 90 go- 
to U3000, the interpreter when it got to line 90 would continue 
execution at line 43000. Presumably if such a program had 
lines with numbers between 90 and 43000, there would be 
another goto somewhere down the line from 43000 that would 
return execution to the intervening area. 

Gotos are most often used in conditional statements; they 
effect branches. For example, a programmer may want the 
computer to evaluate some piece of data supplied by the user 
and then vary its behavior according to its evaluation. 

Basic Beginnings. In the timetable of the computer indus- 
try, Basic has a long and distinguished history. The language 
was invented nearly twenty years ago by a couple of profes- 
sors at Dartmouth College who were trying to make it easier for 
students without technical backgrounds to learn computing. 

The most widely used programming language of that day 
was Fortran, which was a monumental achievement of the 
late fifties. Fortran was and remains a powerful language, 
particularly for mathematical and engineering applications. 
The early versions of Fortran, however, were not adept at 
handling alphabetic information ; nor were they very easy to 
learn — as many an innocent liberal arts student discovered. 

The inventors of Basic, John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz, 
wanted to produce a language that was more general in scope 
and easier to learn and that could be a vehicle for teaching 
computing. They chose the name Basic because it could serve

"About The Dvorak Simplified Keyboard 

The "Qwerty" arrangement that we are all accustomed to wasscientifically designed to be as inefficient as possible, to prevent keyjams on the first typewriters of the 
1870's. Sheer inertia has kept that arrangement in use to this day, even though in 1932, professor A. Dvorak invented (and patented) a new arrangement that makes 
sense. The most often used keys are on the "home" row, and the strongest fingers get most of the work.

as an acronym for Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruc- 
tion Code. 

The first Basic was a humble tongue, with much less power 
than the Applesoft we've come to know and love. In the late 
sixties, however, a number of large computer manufacturers, 
most notably Digital Equipment Corporation, adopted the lan- 
guage and made it available on their own machines. In the proc- 
ess of refurbishing the language for their own machines, this 
and later manufacturers usually added a few features that 
would work only on their machines, and so Basic came to be 
more a group of related dialects than a single, standardized 
language. 

Much later, in 1978, a standard Basic was established un- 
der the auspices of the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI). But that standard pertained only to what you might 
call a core of the language. There are still a myriad of Basics 
in use, each one an extension of the ANSI standard. Basic, in 
short, is not a very portable language; a program written in 
Basic to run on one brand of machine is not likely to run unal- 
tered on some other brand. 

The Four Faces of Apple Basic. Even within the context of 
a single computer brand there may be a variety of Basics in 
use. There are at least four, for example, running on Apples. 

When the Apple II first appeared on the market, it offered 
Integer Basic in ROM. Integer, written by Steve Wozniak, one 
of the two founders of Apple Computer, still has a cadre of 
diehard adherents, although its use in commercial software 
has all but disappeared in favor of Applesoft, which appeared 
with the Apple II Plus. 

Applesoft is Microsoft Basic adapted for the Apple. Micro- 
soft is the company that has dominated the development of lan- 
guages for microcomputers. They were the first on the scene 
with a version of Basic when microcomputers descended on 
the marketplace in 1976, and most of the Basics now running on 
microcomputers have evolved in some fashion from that 
original Microsoft Basic. 



Integer and Applesoft are the two Basics available in ROM 
for the Apple II. A third Basic running on some Apple lis is 
Basic-80, which comes on a disk supplied by Microsoft. Basic- 
80 requires the CP/M operating system, which means that you 
need an additional piece of hardware in one of your peripheral 
slots in order to run it. 

Finally, for Apple III users, there is Apple Computer's Busi- 
ness Basic, which will do everything that Applesoft and In- 
teger will do but has some powerful additional features that 
facilitate the creation and use of large data files on disk. Busi- 
ness Basic only runs in the context of the Apple Ill's Sophisti- 
cated Operating System (SOS). 

So what's basic about Basic and what accounts for its 
popularity? 

It's in English. For starters, its vocabulary is simple. There 
isn't much of it — barely a hundred words in Applesoft or 
Integer — and much of what there is consists either of plain En- 
glish words or simple contractions of English words. 

Furthermore, the parser, for the Apple Basics at any rate, 
is not too fussy about how you enter your commands. You have 
to spell the command words correctly and you have to use 
them appropriately, but you can put spaces around your com- 
mands or not, as you like ; if you put thirty spaces between the 
letters of the word resume, for example, the parser will sift 
through those spaces and figure out what you want. 

Second, the organization of Basic programs by line num- 
ber allows you great freedom in your work habits. You don't 
have to work out all the details of a program before you start 
programming. You can number your lines in increments of, 
say, ten and then, should you discover you've left something 
out, make insertions between the lines, so to speak. It doesn't 
matter in what chronological order you enter commands, be- 
cause Basic will automatically line them up and execute them 
in numerical sequence. If you find you need a large chunk of 
code between line 20 and line 30, you can put a goto at line 25 
and write the missing chunk at the end of the program. This is 



LOCK-IT-UP 4.1 

Copy-Protection System 
for the Apple II 
by Jeff Gold 

If you are serious about selling software for the Apple II, piracy is the leading problem which you 
will face. According to an article which appeared in SOFTLINE magazine, January 1982, page 21, 
software piracy increases the distribution of programs by as much as five or six times. This 
process is facilitated by many of the "nibble" copy programs now available which claim to copy 
almost all software. 

Double-Gold is now introducing a solution to this problem, Lock-It-Up 4.1. This program will 
take a standard DOS 3.3 diskette, copy-protect it, and then allow rapid duplication of the product. 
Not only does our software protect against all standard copy programs, it also protects against all 
"nibble" copy programs currently available, including: Locksmith 4.1, Back-It-Up, C lone, Omni 
Copy, Nibbles Away, and Copy U+, among others. Our system incorporates over thirty state-of- 
the-art copy-protection features making it highly unlikely for "nibble" copiers to be able to copy 
these diskettes in the near future. Our product also includes an optional "semi-hardware" 
modification, making it unlikely for anyone to successfully copy the protected program even 
in the future. 

Our low one-time fee of only $195 is a small price to pay in order to increase your sales by up to 
six-fold! We will also give extensive support should you have any special needs, or should any 
problems arise. 

The system will run on a 48K Apple II or 11+ with 
Applesoft in ROM or language system, and DOS 3.3, 
and is available now from Double-Gold. COD,

To create professional-looking menus like this. 



Picture this: 

You sit down at your Apple II and boot your 
own custom system disk. 

A "menu ' of numbered options appears. 
Perhaps one says "RUN FILE DEVELOPER." 
Another says "BOOT 13 SECTOR DISK." Other 
options you've defined might be "GAMES" and 
"HOME FINANCES." 

Say you select "GAMES"— just by entering 
a single digit. 

Immediately, another menu appears listing 
the games you own. If the one you select is on a 
different disk, the computer requests you to 
insert that disk and press a key to run it. 

If this sounds like a convenient way to use 
your computer system, you're right. 

If it also sounds like a lot of work to 
program, you're right again. 

Until now. 

Introducing the MENU GENERATOR. 

Now creating your own custom menus is as 
simple as filling out a form on your computer 
screen . 

Just run the MENU GENERATOR, and tell 
it what you want each menu option to say, and 
what action to take when that option is selected. 
You can RUN or BRUN a program, boot another 
disk, execute user— written BASIC statements, or 
perform any valid DOS operation. 

MENU GENERATOR will compile your 
entries into a neat, attractively-formatted screen 
menu, then automatically write a documented, 
bug-free Applesoft program to generate and process 
the menu. 

You can list, copy, and modify this program 
if you want to add your own touches . A single disk 
will hold data for up to 150 different menus. 



Make it easy on others, too! 

If you write programs that other people are 
going to use, you'll find that a few good menus are 
worth 100 pages of instructions. You'll be 
thankful , too, when you put the program aside for 
a couple of months and then try to use it again! 

Pays for itself the first time you use it. 

Using the MENU GENERATOR should save 
at least 95% of the time you'd spend writing your 
own menu program. At just $39.95, can you afford 
not to have this great labor saver working for 
you? 

MENU GENERATOR comes complete with 
program disk, backup disk, and 40-page manual. 
It runs on a 48k Apple II Plus, under DOS 3.3.

not recommended programming practice, but it can be done; 
and the freedom to lay things out in whatever order you like 
does account in part for Basic's appeal, particularly to begin- 
ning or casual programmers. 

The Role of the Interpreter. Closely related to this point is 
perhaps the most crucial factor of all : with Basic you can sit 
right down at your keyboard and make something happen — 
immediately. That's because Basic is normally implemented 
as an interpreted language. 

Here's what that means. 

High-level languages have to be translated into machine 
code before they can be meaningful to the microprocessor. 
This translation can take place by either of two means — a com- 
piler or an interpreter. 

A compiler is a machine-language program that scans an 
entire high-level program and converts it en masse to execut- 
able binary code. Fortran is an example of a language that 
uses a compiler. 

An interpreter, on the other hand, translates high-level in- 
structions one line at a time. It waits until each line is exe- 
cuted before translating the next. 

From the standpoint of execution speed, there are some 
definite advantages to going by way of a compiler. A pro- 
gram, once it works correctly, needs only to be compiled once ; 
the translation overhead is paid in advance. An interpreted 
program, on the other hand, has to be translated and retrans- 
lated every time it's run; furthermore if there is code within 
the program, like a loop of some kind that gets executed more 
than once, that code will have to be retranslated each time it's 
to be executed. 

The big advantage to the interpretive translation pro- 
cedure is that it facilitates program development. Using an in- 
terpreter, you can try out a small segment of a program, just 
to see what it does, without having to go to the bother of com- 
piling the whole program. Or you can make minor changes to 
an existing program and note their effects, again without hav- 
ing to bother with compilation. 



Pesticides. If your program should contain, God forbid, a 
bug, you'll probably find the interpreter a great help in debug- 
ging. Most interpreters have a trace feature that tells the in- 
terpreter to print the line number of each instruction as it exe- 
cutes that instruction. If you're just trying to locate some bit of 
code that's causing unwanted behavior in your program, the 
trace feature can be a pretty handy tool. 

Finally, the interpreter allows you to do things in immedi- 
ate execution. There are times when you don't need to have 
your computer run a complex program but you do want it to 
add a column of numbers. No problem; in the immediate exe- 
cution mode, you can just rap out a command and your Apple 
will fire back an answer. Another way to say all this is that the 
interpreter makes your computer an interactive tool. 

Have Your Cake and Eat. It may have occurred to you that 
a programmer would have the best of all worlds by using an in- 
terpreter for program development and debugging and then 
sending the finished program off to a compiler — if a compiler 
were available. In fact, this is now possible with Applesoft and 
Integer Basic and with Basic-80. As of this writing there are at 
least four compilers on the market for Applesoft, one for In- 
teger, and one for Basic-80. 

A compiler will increase the execution speed of a Basic pro- 
gram by a factor of anywhere from two up to ten or twenty, de- 
pending on the nature of the program. 

It's also possible to interleave a Basic program with one or 
more programs written in assembly language. Basic has a call 
command that transfers control to a machine-language pro- 
gram at a specified address. This call procedure is useful for 
programs that have speed-critical elements but that do not as 
a whole require the immediate response offered by native ma- 
chine code. 

All in all, Basic is a powerful and flexible programming lan- 
guage. It's grown enormously in sophistication and power 
since it first arrived in 1963. Basic does have its detractors, 
however, and we'll look at some of their arguments next month 
when we introduce you to Pascal. 3M

SOFTCARD 
Symposium 

by Greg Tibbetts 



Over the last couple of months, we've been examining the 
various utility programs supplied with the SoftCard. In 
keeping with that pattern, our topic for this month will be the 
utility program ED.COM from Digital Research. 

ED is the general-purpose text editor supplied with nearly 
every CP/M system. In the normal classification of text edi- 
tors, we have all heard the terms line-oriented, character-ori- 
ented, screen-oriented, and so on, applied to various text edi- 
tor programs. Unfortunately, as is the case with a lot of 
computer terminology, these descriptors mean different 
things to different people. Keeping that in mind, we'll avoid 
applying any of them to ED. Instead, we'll simply describe 
the way ED works and let each of you apply your own 
terminology. 

Most SoftCard users who have had an experience with ED 
have come away somewhat frustrated and in many cases have 
thereafter studiously avoided its use. Although ED is a com- 
plex program, rock solid as far as reliability goes.it cannot be 
said to be — another oft-used descriptor — user-friendly. The lack 
of such features as right margin justification and automatic 
word wraparound make it difficult to use for any type of se- 
rious word processing. As such, ED is not the easiest text edi- 
tor to work with, nor is it particularly versatile; and it is cer- 
tainly not in a class with WordStar or Magic Wand. ED is, how- 
ever, reasonably powerful and, for someone who knows how to 
use it, a good utility. 

The purpose of this month's discussion is to shed some light 
on the principles and mechanics of ED and to help you make 
the best use of the potential for applications to which it is par- 
ticularly suited. Those applications seem to be the sort in 
which certain global command facilities are necessary and 
where there is no need for the more advanced word processing 
features at their proportionate cost. The first such use that 
comes to mind is the preparation and alteration of program 
source files (Basic, Fortran, Assembler, and so on). 

The best way to think of ED is to picture it as a window into 
a text file. The window is actually, of course, a memory buff- 
er, and ED makes use of as much memory as has been in- 
stalled in your system. Material is read in at the bottom of the 
window by specffic commands and written out the top of the 
window also by specific commands. The material to be 
brought in comes from the text file specified as the source file, 
and the material to be written out is written to a temporary 
file. 

When the edit session is complete, the original source file is 
renamed to "filename. BAK" and the temporary file is re- 
named to the original text file name. While in the window, in- 
formation may be displayed, altered, deleted, or moved to 
allow new information to be inserted. Some helpful diagrams 
on pages 3-80 and 3-81 in volume 1 of the SoftCard manual 
graphically illustrate this process. 

While in the window, information is stored as a stream of 
bytes of textual material. The information is accessible by ei- 
ther of two reference methods : by line number or by charac- 
ter position. A line of text is defined as any string of characters 



■ ■ 1 1 1 

terminated by a carriage return/line feed (CRLF) sequence. 
There are no upper or lower limits on the number of charac- 
ters in a line; however, in the practical sense, it is difficult to 
see the virtue of lines much longer than the terminal display or 
printer carriage. Although ED does not store line numbers in 
the file, it does create and display them during editing ses- 
sions so that the user has a convenient way to reference mate- 
rial. While you're editing, therefore, the cursor is located at or 
in one of the lines of text currently in the memory buffer or edit 
window. This line is called the current line, and its line num- 
ber is always displayed on the terminal. 

Within the current line of text, the cursor is located at an 
imaginary point called the character pointer (identified here- 
after as CP). Insertion, deletion, or display of characters is 
done based on the location of the CP. The CP may be moved 
back and forth within the current line by different commands, 
and while material may be deleted either to the right or the left 
of the CP, material can only be added to its left, since the CP 
will always move to the right as you type. 

To summarize, then, when you're editing a file, all opera- 
tions are based on the location of the cursor, which is at a spe- 
cific place (the CP) , in a specific line (the current line) , in that 
portion of the file that is in the window (the memory buffer) . 

The cursor may be moved freely throughout the window, ei- 
ther in character increments, by moving the character point- 
er back and forth in the current line, or in large increments, by 
changing to a different current line. Learning to position the 
cursor in ED is often the most frustrating part of the edit ses- 
sion for the new ED user, so we'll examine that first. You can 
benefit most by following along with ED on your Apple as you 
read. 

So that all of us will be able to do the same thing, we'll use 
ED to modify the assembler source file DUMP. ASM. To per- 
form the examples properly, start with a blank disk and use 
FORMAT and COPY to make a copy of your SoftCard master 
disk. The copy of your master disk is the one you'll work with; 
this will ensure that you do not destroy anything important if 
you make a mistake of some sort during the session. 

First, delete MBASIC.COM or GBASIC.COM from the copy 
to give yourself some room. If you have a printer hooked up to 
your system, you'll be able to make listings of how the file will 
appear in various stages in the edit session by typing the com- 
mand PIP PRN: =DUMP.ASM. If you don't have a printer on 
line, you can still perform the session, but you'll have to follow 
the text of this column somewhat more closely. 

The changes we'll be making to DUMP will alter three of its 
functions. As you know if you have used it, DUMP takes a spec- 
ified COM file and prints — to the screen (or to screen and 
printer if you type control-P) — a table of addresses and hexa- 
decimal bytes that make up that file. Since DUMP prints a 
four-character address, sixteen two-character hexadecimal 
numbers, and the necessary spaces between them, the display 
is longer than forty columns and rather hard to read unless you 
have an eighty-column board. Our first change, therefore, will 
be to make DUMP automatically distinguish between forty- 



208 



MAY 1982 



column and eighty-column CP/M systems and format its out- 
put accordingly. Our second change will be to place a colon af- 
ter the address to help set it farther apart, and our third 
change will be to create two spaces between each 128-byte rec- 
ord, also to enhance readability. 

To do this, we'll add thirty-six functional lines of assembly 
code, one line of equate information, and one additional data 
area. This will add seventy-eight bytes to the length of the 
DUMP program. Undoubtedly, with a little time, we could 
make this smaller and more efficient; this might be a fun proj- 
ect for those of you with an interest in 8080 assembler. 

To get started, the first thing to do is to put ED into opera- 
tion. To do so, simply type the command, ED DUMP. ASM. ED 
will respond by printing a colon and an asterisk to the screen. 
The colon will be printed anytime you are in ED and, if the win- 
dow contains text, it will be preceded by a line number. The as- 
terisk, on the other hand, is ED's prompt character, telling you 
that it is ready to accept a command. Any time you don't see 
the asterisk preceding the cursor on your screen, it means 
you're in insert mode and that what you're typing is being in- 
serted into the file and won't be interpreted as a command. 

Our first task now is to get the information from the 
DUMP. ASM file into the window. This is done using the A (for 
append) command. When ED sees the A, it will bring into the 
window the number of lines specified by the decimal number 
preceding the A. If you wish to bring one hundred lines of a 
large file into the buffer, the command is 100A ; for two lines, 
the command is 2A ; and so on. With any of the numeric refer- 
ence commands of ED, it is possible to use a pound sign, #, to 
represent the number 65,535, the highest number ED can deal 
with. Since ED will only act on the number that actually ex- 
ists, regardless of the number specified, we can use #A to bring 
in the entire DUMP file. Do that now. 

On your screen now should be the number 1, followed by a 
colon and the asterisk prompt. We are at the very beginning of

the file, and line number 1 is our current line number. From 
now on, we'll simply refer to it as line 1. The only reason no text 
is displayed is that we haven't asked for any; the text is still 
there. To verify this, use the T (for type) command. Enter #T, 
and watch the entire file list to the screen, ending with the cur- 
rent line reference at line 1 and the asterisk prompt. Now we'll 
try some cursor movement commands. 

There are four methods of moving the cursor from one line 
to another. First is the B (for buffer) command. This com- 
mand moves the cursor either to the beginning of the buffer 
(line 1 in our case since our entire file is in memory) or to the 
end. Used by itself or with a plus sign preceding it, B will go to 
the beginning. Used with a minus sign preceding it, B will go to 
the end. Try a -B and then a +B to verify this. Remember, all 
ED commands must be followed by a carriage return. 

The second method of moving the cursor is simply with + 
or - and some number n. A +n (the number n alone will work 
since a plus is assumed if there is no sign) will move the cur- 
sor n lines further down the file, and a -n will move it n lines 
backward. 

Since we wish to put a new equate statement in the first sec- 
tion between lines 16 and 17, let's move to the beginning of line 
17. Since the current line is line 1, we'll need to move sixteen 
lines ahead, so type the number 16. You should now see the cur- 
rent line number 17 : displayed. If you don't, type B to get back 
to the beginning and then type 16 again. Remember the car- 
riage return after the commands. 

The commands we've just examined, +n or -n, are rela- 
tive movement commands. An additional 16 now would put us 
at 17 + 16 or line 33. This can sometimes be confusing, so it's 
good that there is an easier way to move around. By placing a 
colon after the number, we can turn it into an absolute move- 
ment command. Try that now by entering 1: and you're back at 
line 1. Enter 17: and you're back at line 17. Both commands 
have their uses and you'll want to become familiar with them. 

The next two movement commands are slightly different 
from the first two, since they can be preceded by numbers 
themselves. The first of these is the L for line command. This 
command moves the cursor to the beginning of the line that is 
+n lines ahead of the current line or -n lines behind the cur- 
rent line. This feature of moving to the beginning of the line 
will become important to us later. 

The last command is the F (for find) command, used to find 
some string of text within the window and to place the cursor 
immediately after that text. Used with a +n or -n preceding it, 
ED will find the nth occurrence of the string before stopping 
and placing the cursor after that particular string. 

To demonstrate the L and F commands, let's go back to the 
beginning of the file with B. Now line 17 has as its first word the 
label FCB, so, to find line 17, enter FFCB and follow it with a 
carriage return. Now we're back at 17: with our asterisk 
prompt. But wait, didn't we say that the F command put us at 
the end of the string being searched for? In that case, how 
come it looks as if we're at the beginning of the line? Again, the 
reason is that we didn't tell ED to print any of the line. 

Since the T command we used before will display the cur- 
rent line from the CP to the end of the line, let's see where we 
are by entering T. Is the whole line displayed? Obviously not. 

If preceded by a 0, the T command will display the current 
line up to the CP, so enter 0T now. There's our FCB. Now the 
use for L becomes clearer ; if L is preceded by a 0, it moves to 
the beginning of the current line, so type Oh now. Now enter T 
and you will see the entire line 17. Had we begun our insert 
where we were, we'd have been left with two lines in our file 
that were not correct and that would have resulted in errors in 
the assembler. When using ED, you must always be sure 
where you are. Before you do inserts, use the 0T command to 
verify your position. 

It's about time we did what we said we would, so let's go on 
to the insert process. The / for insert is the ED command used 
most often. It must be typed at the asterisk prompt and can 
only be terminated by a control-Z. Anytime a CRLF sequence 
is generated by your hitting the return key, a new line is 



MAY 1982 



mnnri 



209 



formed in the file. The only time the CRLF is not included in 
your file is when you end the insert mode by typing control-Z 
and following it with a return. That last CRLF will not be 
placed in the file. 

It's easiest to understand this business of returns and con- 
trol-Zs if you simply picture all the material you wish to insert. 
Everything between the / and the control-Z, will become a part 
of the file. Of that information, any sequence of characters 
ended with a return will be a complete line. 

You may enter insert in one of two ways : by typing / fol- 
lowed by a return, or by typing/, then the characters you wish 
to insert, and finally a control-Z return. Both ways have the 
same general effect; however, the former is recommended for 
entering whole new lines, because it has a more standard ap- 
pearance to the user. When you do it that way, after you hit re- 
turn, ED leaves you at the beginning of the current line. If you 
were at the beginning of the line already, the new current line 
is the same as the old one. If the CP was somewhere inside the 
line, all the old information that preceded the CP is now the to- 
tal contents of that line, the CP is moved to the beginning of the 
next line, and all the old information that followed the CP is in 
the new line, still following the CP. Subsequent returns create 
new line separations at the position of the CP. If you wish to 
concatenate the material on both sides of the CP, typing a con- 
trol-Z followed by a return will have that effect. 

Since we wish to add a new line 17 and to move all the fol- 
lowing lines down one, we'll start inserting at the beginning of 
line 17 and follow our text with a CRLF. Are you at the begin- 
ning of the line? Okay, then enter an / and a return. When the 
line is displayed, enter the following, followed by a return. 

SLT3: EQU 0F3BBH ;SLOT 3 CARD TYPE LOCATION 

The spaces between the SLT3: and the EQU and the 
OF3BBH and the ; are actually tab characters created with 
control-I. If your machine is capable of displaying lower case, 
you may use it, but it is usually more readable if you enter 



characters all in upper case. Once you have entered the line 
and followed it with a return sequence, you will see 18: dis- 
played on the screen. ED is now waiting for you to enter a new 
line 18. Instead, enter control-Z. This will exit insert mode and 
leave you again with the asterisk prompt. To check your work, 
enter -1. ED will move the cursor to the beginning of line 17 
and display the line you just entered. If the line is right, follow 
on ; if not, use the K for kill command to delete the current line, 
and start over. 

The next lines we wish to add will start at the label 
OPENOK: , which was line 50 on our original printout. Since we 
have added a line, OPENOK: will now be line 51. We can go 
there with a 51: command, or use FOPENOK: to find it, fol- 
lowed by a OL to put us at the beginning of the line. Finally, it's 
always possible to use relative moves to get to the vicinity and 
to use the T command to type the next few lines until the prop- 
er one is spotted. 

For present purposes, we want to alter the OPENOK: line, 
leaving the label and the portion up to the comma intact, but 
deleting and replacing the portion after the comma. To do that, 
let's use FOPERATION OK, to find the proper position. You 
should now see 51 :* on your screen. Using 0T, you can see that 
the cursor is following the comma. Since we'll want to leave 
the space after the comma, we need to move the CP one more 
character over from its present location. To do so, we enter 1C. 
Now entering 0T will show us to be just following the space af- 
ter the comma. By entering T, we can see the rest of the line 
we wish to delete. 

Deletion of characters can be accomplished in two ways. If 
the characters to be deleted are few in number, you might wish 
simply to use the number of characters and the D for delete 
command, as in nnD. You should always do a T following a de- 
lete to make sure that you have deleted all of the characters 
you meant to (and that you have not miscounted and deleted 
the CRLF sequence also) . Inadvertently deleting the CRLF se- 
quence will take the following line and concatenate it to the

current line — useful if you're trying to do it, a real hassle if you 
don't allow for it. 

The other method is to use the K command. K is normally 
used to delete entire lines or ranges of lines. If any number pre- 
cedes K, then that number of lines, plus or minus, is removed. 
If no number precedes K, the effect depends on whether a plus 
or minus precedes it. A plus or nothing deletes all characters 
after the CP including the CRLF. A minus deletes all charac- 
ters preceding the CP. 

Since we wish to remove all the characters following the 
CP, verify your position and enter K. Now we'll replace K with 
the following: ISET FOR 40/80 COL. OUTPUT. The I is for in- 
sert, and since we don't want to start a new line after the com- 
ma, we didn't enter a return between the / and the set. Be sure 
to enter a return after output however, since our K deleted the 
old one. When ED gives you the next line, terminate insert with 
a control-Z and use a -1 to verify that all went okay. 

Once you've verified that line, you can go on to add nine 
more lines following it. By now you should be feeling more 
comfortable with ED, so we'll pick up the pace a little. Do an L 
command to get past your new line 51 and to the beginning of 
the following line, then an I return to go into insert mode. 

Enter the following nine lines, exactly as shown, remem- 
bering to use tabs between the labels (words followed by 
colons) , the opcodes (the two and three letter words that come 
in the second column), the operands (words, numbers, and so 
on following opcodes) , and the comments (anything that fol- 
lows a semicolon). The comments will make it clear to you 
what we are inserting specifically to do the alteration.

After entering these nine lines, you should be on line 61. 
Now enter a control-Z to terminate insert. To check your work, 
do a - JOT here ; this will display the last 10 lines but leave you 
still on line 61. 

Once you have verified your work, you need to go to what 
used to be (before our insertions) line 66. Since it's now a rath- 
er complex matter to figure where you are, you should use the 
F command to find the words LOW 4 BITS in the line preced- 
ing the one we wish to alter using the command FLOW 4 BITS. 
Once we've found what we're looking for, we can go to the be- 
ginning of our target line with a simple L. By using T, we can 
see the line now says JNZ NONUM. Since we wish the new line 
to read JZ SKIP ; READY FOR NEW ADDRESS, we can sim- 
ply delete the old line and add the new one; but to get some 
practice, let's alter the original line instead. One sequence of 
commands that would alter this line is an FJ return followed 
by a ID return, followed by an FNONUM return, followed by a 
-5D return, followed by an ISKIP<tab> ; READY FOR NEW 
ADDRESS control-Z return. Whew! ED makes it easier for us 
to accomplish this by allowing multiple commands on a single 
line. A single command line for the sequence we just gave is: 

FJ Z1DFNONUM AZ — 5DISKIP<tab>,-READY FOR NEW ADDRESS AZ[RETURN] 

In the example just given, control-Z has been shown as aZ 
for brevity. Try the alteration both ways to verify that it works. 
To do this, you'll have to reenter the line in its original form. 

Once that is done and verified, we'll want to save the re- 
sults of our session so far. We could write the lines done to date 
to the temporary file, using the W for write command in the 
form nW, where n is the last line we wish written to the file. 

The only problem with this procedure is that it removes 
those lines from the window, making it impossible for us to see 
them again. We could also use the E for end command, which

PLAYING GAMES WITH 
YOUR RESOURCES ! 



Was financial management one of your justifications 
for purchasing an APPLE'" computer? 

Are you really managing your finances or just using an 
expensive calculator to help balance your checkbook(s)? 

It takes a double entry system to do the job right. Why ? 

Less than half the financial transactions necessary to 
adequately manage your resources and plan your tax 
strategy can be accomodated with single entry systems. 

How can you use a double entry system without a 
refresher course in accounting? 

You can't, if you use software that simply automates 
the way people do things by hand, . . . but, with 
The ACCOUNTANT, by Decision Support Software, 
the power of your computer is harnessed to offer you the 
advantages of an automated double entry system even if 
you don't know a debit from a credit ! 

'BEST PACKAGE EVALUATED' 

"For the home user (and perhaps in some 
less complex small business), the best package 
we evaluated was the Accountant by Decision 
Support Software." 

— Mind Your Business Dept., Softalk, Jan. 82 

Our users are equally impressed: 

"The ACCOUNTANT is not only very sophisticated 
and full of surprising features, such as automatic 
transactions and linkages to VisiCalc™, but is very 
easy to use". 




The ACCOUNTANT includes 


these 


user oriented features: 


• 


Menu driven 




operations 


• 


Comprehensive 




prompting 


• 


User defined 




account names 


• 


User defined 




code names 


• 


Reference to 




accounts and codes 




by name or number 


• 


Ability to cancel 




operations or queries 




when desired 


• 


Ad hoc queries 



The ACCOUNTANT 
Finance Data Base System 

The ACCOUNTANT is a decision support tool that 
provides an individual or business with timely, accurate 
data to plan, monitor and control their finances. The 
detailed records contained in The ACCOUNTANT'S data 
base will enable you to itemize each and every legitimate 
tax deduction. DBCALC, a VisiCalc™ interface, retrieves 
data from The ACCOUNTANT'S data base and. creates 
a VisiCalc" file of actual and projected financial data 
which can be used for financial simulations and tax 
computations. 

The ACCOUNTANT requires an APPLE II 
with 48K, APPLESOFT and single or dual drives. The 
system includes a master disk and a newly released utility 
disk (both in standard DOS 3.3 format), hardware key, 
and a comprehensive, easy to follow user's guide in an 
attractive binder $129 

DBCALC (with 1040 model included) 
requires VisiCalc'" $20

would write the entire new file, both processed and unpro- 
cessed lines, to the temporary file, rename it to the original file 
name, and rename the original file to the filename. BAK. But 
that means that we'd have to invoke ED all over again to con- 
tinue. What we want is the H for head of file command. This is 
equivalent to issuing an E and then reinvoking ED on the new 
file. We will have to issue the #A to bring the file contents back 
into memory, and then go to the line we wish to alter, but our 
current changes will be saved. Take note of the current line 
number (it should be the one following the line we just al- 
tered), and then do the H return and the #A linenumber: . 

Now that we're back, we're ready to add the next sixteen 
lines, as follows. They can be done with a simple / return.

Once these sixteen lines have been entered and you're posi- 
tioned at the next line, you can end the insert with control-Z. Do 
a -17T to verify your work, and you're ready for the next 
change. This involves adding two lines to print the colon after 
the address number; the lines are inserted after the second 
call to PHEX, twelve lines from our current location. Rather 
than go there with relative or absolute moves, however, let's 
use the F command with the number 2 to find the second oc- 
currence of PHEX. By now you should know that the com- 
mand is 2fphex/\sl. The first part, up to the aZ, takes us to the 
end of line we want, and the L moves us to the beginning of the 
next line to start inserting. The two lines to insert are : 



MVI 
CALL 



A/:' 

PCHAR 



; LOAD VALUE FOR i 
;AND GO PRINT IT 



IN ACCUMULATOR 



Be sure to verify your work. 

Now we want to alter the line that reads CRLF : and to add 
four lines after it, so we get there with an FCRLF: return. We 
alter the line by typing: 



Ktab>MOV 
ORA 
RAL 
ORA 
JZ 



A,L 
A 



A 
P2 



;GET ADDRESS IN ACCUMULATORfRETURN] 
; CLEAR CARRY FOR ROTATE 
; ROTATE BITS LEFT, IF ADDRESS IS 
; 80 OR 00, THIS SETS THE ZERO FLAG 
,-IF SO, PRINT TWO CRLFS A Z[RETURN] 



All of the lines above have returns after them, even though 
only the first and last lines show the return. The last line con- 
tains aAZ to show that we want to terminate the line unthout an 
extra return since we still have the one that was following 
CRLF: when we first began inserting. We are now at the be- 
ginning of the line that used to follow CRLF: . We wish to put in 
a blank comment line and add a label CRLF1: at the begin- 
ning of our current line. The quickest way to do this is to use 
the command sequence: 

I,-[RETURN]CRLF1: A Z[RETURN] 

As you can see by now, this creates a comment line (empty ex- 
cept for the semicolon) , puts the new label at the beginning of 
our current line, and then concatenates the two sides of the CP 
by exiting insert mode without another return. 

Now it's time for you to do some on your own. However you 
wish to do it, go to the first of two empty comment lines pre- 
ceding the label PNIB: and insert the following: 



P2: 



CALL CRLF1 
CALL CRLF1 
JMP CRLF1 



PRINT EXTRA CRLF 
PRINT EXTRA CRLF 
PRINT ORIGINAL CRLF AND RETURN 



How did it go? See how easy it is? 

The last thing we want to do is to add the new data area, so 
go to the line immediately preceding the empty comment line 
just ahead of the comment STACK AREA and add the line: 



FLAG: 



DS 



1 



,•40/80 COLUMN FLAG 



Now we're through with the edit session. Print out the file or 
use the L and T commands to display it on the screen. Once 
you're sure all the changes have been made successfully, end 
the session with an E — and that's all there is to it. 

Next month, we'll continue with this program in our dis- 
cussion of the Digital Research assembler ASM.COM. Until 
next month . . .

When most of us bought our Apples we could hardly wait to 
start filling up those empty slots within the computer. A few 
disk drives, RAM cards, and interfaces later, it began to look 
like those eight slots just might not be enough. For those of you 
in such a situation, or hoping to avoid it, multifunction boards 
may be the answer. They offer several advantages over indi- 
vidual cards but also have their drawbacks. 

Can the Whole Be Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts? The 
purpose of a multifunction board is to combine the hardware 
from several peripherals onto one circuit board. This has nu- 
merous advantages because many of the components can be 
shared by more than one function. Only one circuit board is re- 
quired (a major cost in any peripheral) and only one slot is 
used up. For what it offers, a multifunction board will usually 
consume less power, generate less heat, and cost significantly 
less than a comparable collection of separate interface boards. 

While putting several functions on one board may seem like 
a good idea, there is the problem of how to access all of them. 
Most peripherals for the Apple interface through the IN# and 
PR# hooks designed for this purpose. This makes it very easy 
to use them from Basic and only requires that you know which 
slot the peripheral board is in. With multifunction boards how- 
ever, there are several input and output devices but only one 
set of hooks to the slot in which the multicard is placed. This 
problem has been dealt with by using special hardware or soft- 
ware that makes each device appear to be in different "phan- 
tom" slots. 

Mountain Computer CPS MultiFunction Card 

The CPS card (Clock/Parallel/Serial) was probably the 
first multifunction board to become popular. As its name im- 
plies, it combines a real-time clock/calendar, a parallel port, 
and a serial interface. Another unique feature of this board is 
the fact that many of the configuration parameters necessary 
for its operation are stored in low-power memory on the board, 
maintained even when the computer is turned off by having its 
own battery. 

Installation of the CPS board requires placing one chip 
from the Apple's motherboard on a header and running a short 
cable from it to the card itself. The board can be placed in any 
slot except zero. The next step is to run the Setup program sup- 
plied to configure the card to your system. Figure 1 shows the 
options available with this program.

Options 1 and 2 are used to load and save files that contain a 
complete set of configuration parameters. For example, if the 
CPS card is to be used with a Novation CAT modem, the file 
Modem can be loaded; this will set up the I/O default parame- 
ters to work with this device. If you are using some other de- 
vice, then you will probably use option 3 to set up the proper in- 
formation as necessary. This option lets you determine the 
clock data format, serial input and output parameters, and 
parallel output specifications. In particular, the clock data in- 
put can be in one of two formats. Format 1 looks like the Moun- 
tain Computer Apple Clock with month/day and hour/min- 
utes/seconds information. Following the seconds are three 
zeros to represent milliseconds. This is simply for compatibil- 
ity, since the CPS card does not keep track of milliseconds. In 
format number 2 the input string includes a day-of-the-week 
digit and the year. 

Serial input and output parameters include setting of the 
baud rate, parity, word length, and stop bits. Conversion of 
lower-case letters to upper case is also allowed, as well as set- 
ting line length, page length, high bit on/off, and auto line feed 
for serial output. Similar parameters can also be set for the 
parallel output device. 

Option 4 sets the actual slot assignments for each of the 
three devices. Except for slot 0 and the boot disk controller 
slot, any of the CPS devices can be assigned to any one or more 
slots. If there is already another card in the slot selected, then 
the CPS "phantom" slot selection will take precedence. Thus, 
to access the actual board in that slot requires that the phan- 
tom slot operation be disabled. Assuming you set up the slots 
once and don't change things, this technique seems to work 
adequately. If you often engage in card swapping, however, 
the phantom slot settings can be an invitation to disaster (it is 
even possible to make your system incapable of booting!). 

The next Setup option, of course, is used to set the clock to 
the correct local time. The next two are then an extension of 
the slot assignments, in that they determine what device will 
be accessed when the actual CPS slot is addressed for input or 
output. 

When all information has been entered, a detailed listing of 
the setup can be printed through option 8. If desired, you can 
save arrangement to disk; and, finally, when option 9 is exe- 
cuted, the Setup program leaves all the parameters set into the 
battery-backed memory. 

Aside from the usual IN# and PR# commands to initialize 
the input or output devices, the CPS card also recognizes sev- 
eral further command sequences. These commands are used 
to change temporarily the default input/output devices or to 
enable/disable the phantom slots. Whenever the CPS card is 
selected for output (by the PR# command) a special com- 
mand sequence can be initiated by sending a control-W. This 
can be accomplished from the keyboard, from within a pro- 
gram, or even from another input device. After the card has 
received the control-W, one or more of the following letters 
may be sent to indicate what action the card is to take : 

S — stops processing command sequences (for example, to allow out, ut of the 
control-W character). 

A — selects the clock as the current input device and allows output ;hrough the 
CPS board. 

C — selects the clock as the current input device and suppresses output from the 
CPS board.

I — selects the serial port as the current input device. 
O — selects the serial port as the current output device. 
P — selects the parallel port as the current output device. 
D — disables the currently established phantom slots. 
E — enables the currently established phantom slots. 

These extra commands make the board easy to use under 
special circumstances. Instead of going through the entire pro- 
cedure of the Setup program, you can make simple changes 
through a few keystrokes. 

When the serial or parallel port is being used, a number of 
escape codes are also recognized. These codes are not actual- 
ly invoked via the escape key; instead they use a control-I (or 
alternatively, control-A) as a lead-in character. This is similar 
to the standard schemes used by other Apple I/O interfaces. 
Figure 2 shows the complete list of escape codes. Note that 
most of these commands do not conform to the Apple de facto 
standards; other commands, such as the control-IxxN to set 
line length, are not recognized at all. This should not pose 
much of a problem but one can only wonder why a more stan- 
dard set of codes was not chosen. 

C — clears high order bit. 
S — sets high order bit. 

E — enables auto line feed after carriage return. 
K — disables auto line feed after carriage return. 
F — enters full duplex terminal mode. 
H — enters half duplex terminal mode. 
L — passes lower-case letters unmodified. 
N — ignored. 

U — converts lower case to upper case. 

R — selects regular video display. 

D — selects special inverse video display mode. 

O — turns off video output. 

V — turns on video output. 

T — enables absolute tabbing. 

B — returns to regular tabbing. 

Control-A — changes escape character to control-A. 

Control-I- — changes escape character to control-I. 

Figure 2. 

Most of these functions are self-explanatory, but a couple 
are unique to the CPS card. The special inverse display mode, 
for example, prints lower-case letters as normal capital let- 
ters and prints upper-case letters in inverse. This can some- 
times be useful to those who do not own a lower-case adapter. 
In the normal display mode, lower-case letters will usually ap- 
pear as garbage (this is why there is another command to con- 
vert lower case into upper case) . Another feature of the CPS 
card is that it offers two types of horizontal tabbing. This is 
handy because it allows absolute positioning with the Apple- 
soft tab function in lines longer than forty characters. 

Another feature of the CPS board is its ability to emulate a 
dumb terminal. This provides a simple means for using the 
Apple with other computer systems, usually via a modem. Fi- 
nally the CPS board system disk is a utility program called the 
CPS Lister, which makes use of both the clock and printer port 
of the CPS card. It allows you to make formatted listings of Ap- 
plesoft programs with optional time and date stamping at the 
top of each page as well as sequential page numbering. This 
can be quite useful when you are working on a program and 
generating several listings at various stages of development. 
By glancing at the time stamp on the printout, you can easily 
determine which listing you're looking at. 

As you can tell from the preceding discussion, the CPS Mul- 
tiFunction Card is a sophisticated device. In fact, in some re- 
spects it's a bit too formal. For example, when connecting to 
the serial port you must provide all the signals specified in the 
RS-232 standard. This includes all the modem control lines that 
are normally not used, especially when hooking up a printer. 
What this means is that you may have to take apart your cable 
to add some jumper wires to get things to work. Unfortunate- 
ly, this information is not described in much detail in the man- 
ual. The manual leaves much to be desired. There is very little 
said about hooking up the card to other devices ; Three exam- 
ples are given but they do not provide much insight. 



Compatibility Problems. On the first page of its operating 
manual, Mountain Computer claims that any Basic or ma- 
chine language software for the Apple II, including VisiCalc 
and software written for the Mountain Computer Apple Clock, 
will work with the CPS Card. We tried the board with all pro- 
grams that came on the Apple Clock system disk. None of 
them worked, because they did not recognize the CPS card as a 
clock. Digging through the manual, we discovered that a new 
slot-finding routine was needed. Fortunately, the programs 
were in Basic so it wasn't too hard to make the necessary 
modification. 

Next we tried VisiCalc and VisiDex. Although the printer 
port functioned correctly, the clock did not work with VisiDex. 
This was caused by the CPS card's lack of interrupt-generat- 
ing capabilities. Also because of this, the clock would also not 
work with the Mountain Computer Introl X-10 system. So far, 
the manufacturer's claim seemed considerably overstated. 

Further compatibility problems have arisen with the CPS 
board and other software/hardware combinations. Many of 
the difficulties reported were due to a design problem in the 
early versions of the board. 

Mountain Computer's technical service department con- 
firmed that there had been a hardware bug but said this prob- 
lem had been fixed. Many of the bad boards were fixed in the 
field, and those still experiencing difficulty can have their 
boards updated if necessary. The other problems concerning 
software compatibility still seem to exist. Some software 
manufacturers have been able to modify their programs to 
work with the board, but others are still incompatible. 

Contrary to their advertising, there are several more dis- 
appointments with the CPS card. Although the phantom slot 
idea seems like a novel approach to regain some more slots, it 
does not truly release any of them. There still are only seven 
PR# and IN# hooks that can be used, and any boards in the 
CPS's phantom slots become more restricted. Another claim is 
that the clock gives the day of week and year and is compati- 
ble with the Apple Clock. While both of these claims individ- 
ually are correct, they don't tell you that you can't have both 
formats at the same time. If you plan on using the clock with 
any existing software, you must configure it to emulate the Ap- 
ple Clock. In this mode, the day and year information are not 
available. Even if you wanted to write your own programs to 
use the other format, you would have to keep running the Set- 
up program to change formats between programs. 

The CPS MultiFunction Card sells for $239. Pascal and 
CP/M software add another $20 each. Cables for the parallel or 
serial port are $25. 
Spies Laboratories Synergy-Card 

The Synergy-Card combines on one board 16K or 64K of 
RAM, a serial port, a parallel port, a clock/calendar, two 
timers, and a BSR ultrasonic control. In case you don't need all 
of those functions, the board is available in several reduced 
forms. In fact, you can buy the Synergy-Card with just the 16K 
or 64K of RAM. Then as your needs expand, you can add the 
other functions. Installation in slot 0 is just as with other RAM 
boards — one RAM chip is transferred from the motherboard 
and replaced with a jumper plug. 

As a RAM board, the Synergy-Card performs as expected, 
holding the alternate Basic, Pascal, or extra memory for Visi- 
Calc or CP/M. With the 64K version, the board appears as four 
16K boards that are bank-selectable through a control ad- 
dress. The real power of this board, however, is through the 
special DOS drivers that get loaded into the normally unused 
"second 4K bank" of RAM. When any of the optional functions 
are ordered, special software is included to use the options 
from DOS, Pascal, and CP/M. 

The Synergy-Card and DOS. Most of the expanded features 
of the Synergy-Card are easily reached through simple DOS 
commands. For example, operation of the parallel port is spe- 
cified by the command PR#8 (preceded by the usual control-D 
of course) . Although this would normally give a range error in 
DOS, the special Synergy DOS interprets this as a command to

ASCII Character: Console Command: 



turn on the parallel port. No control commands are supported 
by this port, so you must first set up the proper parameters, 
such as line length, by using a configuration program. A built- 
in graphics dump routine allows printout of either hi-res 
screen, plus inverted and/or double size options. A double hi- 
res dump is also provided, for those with either an Apple III or 
the Double Hi-Res board manufactured by Spies. 

The serial port is selected with the PR#9 command. This 
will allow output to a printer, modem, or other serial device. 
Unfortunately, no similar command is available to use the se- 
rial port for input ; this can be accomplished from machine lan- 
guage, however. A sample program is included to turn the Ap- 
ple into a dumb terminal at 300 baud. The port itself is a sim- 
ple four-wire interface with data in, data out, common, and one 
extra handshake line. This last line, however, does not con- 
form to the RS-232 signal levels (the manual says this requires 
adding a 3K resistor but does not describe how) . When the se- 
rial port is used to drive a printer, this handshake line can be 
used to detect ready /busy status if the printer has such capa- 
bility. When used to interface with a modem, this signal would 
probably indicate connect status. 

To call the clock/calendar, two commands are available. 
The first is IN#10, which returns a string of the form : 

W MO/DD/YY HH ; MN;SS.XXX 

This gives day of week, month, day, year, hour, minutes, sec- 
onds, and milliseconds. Another format, more compatible with 
the Mountain Computer Apple Clock, is available with the 
command IN#11. This returns a string in the format: 



MO/DD HH ; MN;SS.XXX 

If you do not want the time printed on the screen while it's 
being read, a PR#10 or PR#11 can be used to suppress output. 
Since the clock chip used on the Synergy-Card only times down 
to the second, resolving milliseconds is accomplished through 
an ingenious scheme. One of the two on- board timers is used to 
count the 1024 Hz signal from the clock chip. This is converted 
in software to milliseconds and automatically aligned with the 
clock's seconds counter. Because of this procedure, whenever 
the reset key is pressed or DOS is restarted (via 3D0G) there is 
a short delay of up to one second. Another handy feature of the 
clock is that it can automatically stamp files stored on the disk 
with time and date. This feature is similar to that found on 
other clocks, except that the Synergy-Card stores the creation 
date of any file. This means that if you update a file or store a 
later version, the original date remains intact. 

The two programmable interval timers are called solely 
through machine language and can be used for real-time pro- 
gramming or for generating interrupts. Each timer repre- 
sents a sixteen- bit counter clocked by the Apple's 1.0205 MHz 
crystal-controlled signal. This gives them a range from about 
one microsecond to more than sixty- four milliseconds. Timer 2 
can also be set to count the 1024 Hz signal from the clock giv- 
ing it an additional range up to sixty- four seconds. Under nor- 
mal conditions, timer 1 is used for operating the serial ports 
and timer 2 is dedicated for use with the clock/calendar. 
Therefore these timers are not really available unless you are 
willing to give up one of the other features. 

Last but not least, there is the BSR ultrasonic controller in- 
terface. This port connects to a small microphone that acts as 
a transmitter to send signals to the BSR command console. To 
accomplish this, the microphone is first connected to a small 
plug on the Synergy-Card. Then it is placed in front of the com- 
mand console so that the ultrasonic signals can activate the 
BSR system. Sending these commands is accomplished by 
first selecting the BSR port through a PR#12 command. Then 
the desired commands are sent by printing a string of charac- 
ters, as shown in table 1.

Table 1. 



These characters were chosen to be compatible with the 
Mountain Computer Introl/X-10 system. Although the Introl 
system allows for only four brightness levels, two more com- 
mands have been added to the Synergy-Card BSR control. 
These are the G and H commands, which send a single bright 
or dim signal respectively. With these two commands any 
brightness level can be achieved. 

Since there is no PROM firmware on the Synergy-Card, all 
of the I/O drivers for the various functions are stored in part of 
the on-board RAM. These drivers are linked into the system 
through the modified Synergy DOS. Because they are in RAM, 
it is very easy to change certain parameters within them. Set- 
ting up these parameters is the function of the Config pro- 
gram. The parallel and serial port parameter selections are 
fairly standard. 

The clock offers MM/DD/YY HH;MM for DOS auto- 
dating. This allows you to specify how much of the time string 
to store in the catalog (starting from the left) . For example, se- 
lecting eight characters will log only the date for each file. 

Here's another handy little trick: Assign PR#1 to 8 or 9. 
Many programs assume that a printer card is installed in slot 
1. This option allows you to reassign the PR#1 command to an- 
other slot, particularly 8 or 9 for use with the Synergy-Card 
parallel or serial ports. Of course, you can also leave PR#1 as a 
PR#1, in case you have another board in slot one. 

The Synergy-Card and Pascal. Software is provided to op- 
erate the parallel port from Pascal. This is accomplished 
through Pascal's Attach BIOS protocol, which links the driver 
directly into the operating system. This driver will work with 
some printers, such as the Epson MX series, but may require 
modification for others. This modification requires knowledge 
of assembly language but is not too difficult. 

No attempt has been made to interface with the serial port, 
nor is there any easy access to the clock. A sample program 
demonstrating use of the clock is provided, but it is quite 
messy. The biggest disappointment is that even with the 
clock/calendar in the Apple, you still have to set the date man- 
ually every time you boot. 

The Synergy-Card and CP/M. Both the parallel and serial 
ports are accessible from CP/M. They are assigned the physi- 
cal devices LPT and UL1 respectively. Either port can be as- 
signed as the printer or the logical device LST. This is done 
through the CP/M STAT command. For example, STAT 
LST: =LPT would designate the parallel port as the printer in- 
terface. If you need to change any of the parallel or serial in- 
terface parameters, you must do it under DOS, using the Con- 
fig program. These changes can then be incorporated into 
CP/M by immediately booting up CP/M and saving the driver , 
file with the command, Save 17 S. COM. Installing the Syner- 
gy-Card drivers into CP/M is then accomplished by simply

typing S. No provisions are provided for calling the clock from 
CP/M. 

The Synergy-Card is quite a package. Besides the large 
number of functions it offers, there is plenty of software to 
back it up. Another plus is that assembly language source code 
is supplied for much of the software. This might be of consid- 
erable help in customizing the board for a given program or 
application. 

The biggest drawback to this board is its lack of firmware. 
While this may be of little consequence to some users, it does 
present a big problem to anyone running canned programs 
(especially those with a special DOS) . Neither VisiCalc, Visi- 
Dex, nor DB Master, for example, will work directly with the 
Synergy-Card. For this reason, Spies suggests that the board is 
geared more toward the OEM (original equipment manufac- 
turer) than the average "plug-and-go" user. Depending upon 
your needs and compatibility requirements, however, this 
board can be a powerful addition to your computer. 

The 16K Synergy-Card sells for $195. The 64K version goes 
for $349. Option 1 adds the parallel port, serial port, and timers 
for $59. Option 2 requires option 1 and adds the clock/calendar 
for another $49. Option 3 requires the other two and adds BSR 
X-10 control for an additional $39. No cables are included but 
they are available for $30 (parallel) or $20 (serial) . 

Good News, Bad News. Both of the boards reviewed exem- 
plify the problems of multifunction cards. They seem to offer a 
lot for your money, but they also represent a compromise in 
usefulness. The CPS Card is quite a bargain if all you need is a 
simple clock, a parallel interface, and a serial interface. There 
is no question that three separate interface boards to accom- 
plish the same functions would cost more, draw more power, 
and take up two extra slots. But this assumes that you really 
need all three functions ; it might be possible to find a better 
buy if you only needed a clock and printer interface. 



More important, with separate boards you can have all the 
features that you want instead of settling for what's available 
on the multicard. For example, you might want a parallel in- 
terface with on-board buffering so that you can regain use of 
the computer while you are printing. Or how about built-in 
firmware to do text formatting or screen dumps? Perhaps you 
would like automatic date setting in Pascal or interrupt capa- 
bilities or full 256-device BSR control with security lockout 
against unauthorized use. These features are available on 
other top-of-the-line boards but currently are not possible with 
most multicards. if you later decide that you want such fea- 
tures, you will probably have to buy another board. 

The Spies Laboratories Synergy-Card probably offers the 
most on one board in terms of hardware. The software sup- 
plied is also quite elaborate, although it raises a serious ques- 
tion of compatibility. Since it requires its own special DOS, it 
immediately becomes useless for much of the software cur- 
rently on the market. While this may only reflect the poor state 
of affairs in software standards (brought about by the need to 
devise copy protection techniques) it does present a real prob- 
lem to the potential end user. 

If you are contemplating the purchase of a multifunction 
card, the key word to remember is caution. Make sure you 
know exactly what you are getting, what software it will work 
with and what problems, if any, it may cause. Also be sure you 
will be satisfied, now and in the future, with the features it of- 
fers. If there are no major sacrifices, or you are just plain run- 
ning out of slots, then multifunction cards can be a worthwhile 
way to expand the capabilities of your computer. HI

Softalk Presents The Bestsellers 



When the big news concerning bestsellers has to do with 
VisiCalc, it almost falls into the category of "dog bites 
man." 

This refers, of course, to the journalistic maxim that 
"dog bites man" happens everyday and therefore is not 
news; however, this truism continues, should an enterpris- 
ing reporter stumble across a "man bites dog" story he's 
got himself an unusual occurrence that warrants being 
called news. 

March sales results provided VisiCalc with both a "dog 
bites man" and a "man bites dog" tale. 

The more common story is that VisiCalc clobbered all 
other Apple II software packages by an unprecedented mar- 
gin during the month, doubling the sales of the next closest 
competitor for the first time since the Softalk poll origi- 
nated twenty months ago. Softalk recently initiated the con- 
vention of setting the index number of the second-place pro- 
gram near 100 and letting the VisiCalc index fall where it 
would above that level. 

Last month Wizard ry made a concentrated run at Visi- 
Calc, but it now appears as though the spreadsheet pro- 
gram needs a new category, perhaps most appropriately 
called "One of a Kind," rather than a new convention to 
track its results. Sales of this magnitude seem to reflect 



Apple III 



both the value of the program and the increasing penetra- 
tion of the Apple II into serious computing environments as 
opposed to the home market. 

The domination of VisiCorp's bellwether program in the 
Apple II marketplace only punctuates the anomaly of its 
second-place finish in Sof talk's first poll of Apple III soft- 
ware sales. Last month's statement that VisiCalc would not 
be the perennial leader because it was sold bundled with the

Apple III was in error; but the resulting conclusion that it 
would not be the leading program in the poll turned out to be 
accurate. 

Apple Writer III, surely one of the most powerful micro- 
computer word processors extant, led sales of Apple III 
software, with VisiCalc second. One explanation for the up- 
set is that most Apple III buyers have been picking up Visi- 
Calc at the time of original purchase while Apple Writer III 
was not available when the machine was first introduced.

This train of thought projects that Apple Writer will soon sat- 
urate that preexisting market and then VisiCalc will gain 
the lead. 

Personal Filing System and PFS: Report were third and 
fourth in Apple III sales with Apple III Business Graphics 
fifth, Access III sixth, Apple Business Basic seventh, Apple 
III Pascal eighth, Accounting Software from Great Plains 
ninth and Mail List Manager tenth. The immaturity of the 
Ill's marketplace is reflected by the presence of two lan- 
guage systems among the leaders, reflecting the necessity 
of the user base to write their own rather than buy applica- 
tions software.

One surprise omission from the list is Word Juggler from 
Quark, another powerful word processor. 

The dearth of Apple III software is indicated also by the 
larger percentage penetration of each package into the 
marketplace. Although there are approximately twenty Ap- 
ple lis for each Apple III, two of the bestselling Apple III 
products would actually have placed in the Apple II Top 
Thirty. Apple Writer III would have been fourteenth and 
VisiCalc III sixteenth. 

To put this sales volume in perspective, a program 
achieving an equal penetration of the Apple II market 
would achieve an index rating of approximately 900. 

In the Apple II marketplace, Personal Filing System re- 
gained second place from Wizardry, which dropped to fifth. 
Home Accountant rose from sixth to third and Snack At- 
tack edged up to fourth from fifth to reclaim bragging 
rights as the leading entertainment package.

where Upper Reaches of Apshai climbed into fourth. Wiz- 
ardry, Apventure to Atlantis, and Ultima retained the top 
three positions. 

There was some shuffling of order among the Word Pro- 
cessor Five, but no changes in the programs listed. Most 
interesting was Superscribe II' a continued hold on first, 
even though the program has not shipped for two months. 
Those continued sales are an indication of the length of the 
pipeline between the software publisher and the end user. 

Another item of note was the renewed challenge of Sili- 
con Valley's Word Handler. Probably benefitting from the 
shortage of Superscribe, with which it is most directly com- 
petitive, Word Handler rose to a solid sixth and appeared to 
have the strength to climb higher. 

The Business Ten remained relatively stable with the ex- 
ception of the surge of sales of BPI's Accounts Receivable 
package. The database race continues hot with PFS, DB 
Master, and VisiFile holding down the second through 

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 8.7 percent of 
all sales of Apples and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in 
the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in April to ascertain their sales lead- 
ers for the month of March. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was number of sales made — 
such other criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer 
retailer, and personal preference of the individual respondents were not 
considered. 

Respondents in April represented every geographical area of the conti- 
nental United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in 
the index number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. 
The index number is an arbitrary measure of relative strength of the 
programs listed. Index numbers are correlative only for the month in which 
they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index rating of 50 in one 
month represents equivalent sales to an index number of SO in another 
month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus-or-minus 3.8 percent, which trans- 
lates roughly into the theoretical possibility of a change of 2.71 points, plus or 
minus, in any index number.

fourth spots on the list and Data Factory still threatening. 

The Hobby Ten list underwent significant revision. Bea- 
gle Bros made the top of the list their own private preserve 
with Utility City ranking first and DOS Boss nailing down 
second. TASC, Program Line Editor, and LISA 2.5 rejoined 
the list and Bag of Tricks, Quality's new entrant from the 
authors of Beneath Apple DOS, rose to eighth in its first 
month of distribution. 

Stability was the hallmark of the Home Ten also, with 
only Apple Speller being displaced and only Tax Beater re- 
joining the list. Home Accountant and Tax Preparer con- 
tinued as the dominant one-two punch. 

Software sales in March displayed wider geographical 
disparities than any time since the Softalk poll began. Us- 
ually, dealers all over the country have similar reports on 
the volume of business done. In March, however, dealers in 
the East and West reported almost uniformly slower sales 
while dealers in the Midwest were crowing about booming 
software sales. 

Almost all dealers reported larger gross sales, however, 
because of heavy sales of business systems. Business sys- 
tems usually include extra disk drives, printers, and higher 
ticket software. Hi

"THE BEST COMPUTER SPORTS GAME." 
l That's the award SSI's COMPUTER 

k BASEBALL™ received from Electronic 
A Games magazine (a subsidiary of 

A Video magazine) for 1982. 

^ We appreciate the recognition, 

I ^ but frankly, we're not surprised, 

j^r;^ Especially when you consider 

A what it took to be the best: 

It's a computer strategy 
game* so thorough yet so 
easy to use you'd swear 
you're managing a live 
team. 

It lets you enter exten- 
sive player statistics so you can 
create any team you like — 
J^f^i ^ orri neighborhood 

(JH^^I^l^V hackers to the S reat 1944 
m. . « wMs^mN st. Louis Browns! 

It gives you over 25 

strategy options to choose 

from, options so complete 

you nave to remember to 

warm up relief pitchers in 

the bullpen. 

Its color Hi-Res graphics display 
has enough animation to give you a 
good feel for the flow of the game. 
As a clincher, Teams Data Disks for 1980 
and 1981 are available if you want to use real 
AL and NL teams of those seasons. 
And the price? A steal at $39.95. (Data disks 
are sold separately from SSI for $15.00 each.) 
As exciting as all this sounds, it's nothing 
compared to what you'll see when you get your 
mitts on the game at your local computer/game 
store. Then you'll really understand why people say 
Computer Baseball is what it is. 
The best.

WE GOT RID OF 
THE LOWER CASE ADAPTER 



and put lower case on the screen 
WITHOUT HARDWARE. 



THEN WE GOT RID OF 
THE 80 C0L0MN ROARD 




and put seventy columns of text on the screen 
WITHOUT HARDWARE. 



HEN WE GOT RID OF 
WASTED EDITING TIME 




by developing printer spooling 
AGAIN WITHOUT HARDWARE! 



AND WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR 
NEW WAYS TO SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY 




When ON-LINE SYSTEMS began work on SCREENWRITER II, we wanted to make it the 
most powerful word processor on the market. We began by putting in boldfacing, 
underlining, form letter capabilities, global search and replace, support of multiple disk 
drives, full macro capabilities, generation of up to four indices, complete formatting 
capabilities, a software based keyboard buffer, full editing capability of any DOS 3.3 text 
or binary file (including APPLESOFT programs) and all other features you need for professional word processing. That was just the 
beginning. . . . 

Our next step was to make SCREENWRITER II hardware independent, so we eliminated the lower case adapter and the 80 column 
board. SCREENWRITER II is the only word processor on the market to offer true software based lower case and 70 column screen 
available today. 

The move that put us over the top was the introduction of printer spooling* which allows you to do your editing while printing, 
making your word processing time more efficient. 

With SCREENWRITER II, we've added all the features you need, did away with all the problems you can do without, and we did it all 
at a price that you can afford-$ 129.95. 

"Printer spooling feature only available for printers with APPLE parallel or SSM AIO interface, and EPSON printers/APPLE II and APPLE II Plus are registered trade 
marks of APPLE COMPUTER INC. 

We Don't Think That Word Processing Should Cost An Arm And A Leg, 
And At On-Line Systems, We Won't Stand For It. 

SCREENWRITER II runs on any 48K APPLE II / II Plus with DOS 3.3 and is available now at your local computer store or directly from
