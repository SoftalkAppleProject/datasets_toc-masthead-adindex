Saint Patrick's Day is just around the cor- 
ner, but before you go pouring yourself a 
Bailey's Irish Cream or sucking down a tall 
Bushmill's, pull up a stool and have a giggle or 
two with us. 

In honor of ol' Pat the patron saint, we're 
going to have some fun with limericks. You 
know what a limerick is, don't you? It's a light 
five-line verse that serves no other purpose than 
to be cute or humorous (depending on your 
sense of humor). 

Limericks first appeared in England more 
than one hundred fifty years ago as a party 
game. The idea was to make up a nonsense five- 
line rhyme, after the recitation of which every- 
one sang a chorus that ended with the fine, 
"Won't you come up to Limerick?" 

Well, parties like that tend to have a lot of 
drinking going on, and the more the spirits 
flowed, the more the spirits fiew. Party animals 
of the Victorian variety. The drunker they got, 
the bawdier and sillier the verses became. 

Of course, if we were just to have you all 
send in your favorite limericks, that would be 
boring. Besides, the unwritten laws of good 
taste would prohibit our printing most of them. 
So here's the catch: each limerick must contain 
at least one reference to a product or its manu- 
facturer that is advertised in this issue. Here's an 
example from our last limerick contest: 

My wife spent last week in the loft. 
I know she's alive; she just coughed. 

She has found no new suitor; 

It's that Apple computer. 
I'm afraid that she's gone micro soft. 

— Eric Marks (Mount Tabor, NJ) 



My brother, named Ed, had a fight 
For a woman whose honor was bright. 
Asked he, "Was I wrong 
To ring that guy's gong?" 
"No," I said, "Ed, you were right." 

— Mike Leavitt (Reston, VA) 

The first example spells it right out in the 
last two words (Microsoft). Perfectly legal. 

The second one virtually requires you to 
read the last line out loud to get tlie company's 
name (Edu-Ware). Also legal, and a bit more 
subtle. 

The subject of your limerick is up to you. It 
can be funny, witty, punny, or just plain silly. 
Clue: a good way to win is by making yours 
stand out in the crowd. Get crazy! 

Limericks will be judged on cleverness, 
jazziness, and general toughness in figuring out | 
what product or company you refer to in the j: 
limerick. 

The winner of this contest will win $100 in 
booty made by advertisers in this issue, and fi- 
nalists will win a month's supply of Irish Spring. 

Also, be sure to include this coupon or a 
facsimile of it: 

I call meself: 

My house is at: 

Village, state, zip: 

Phone: 

If I win, I'd be so excited to have: 



Send your entry to Softalk 0'Con(nell)test, Box 
60, North Hollywood, CA 91603. All entries 
must be postmarked by April 15, 1983; those

sideration.

Stop right there! Don't you be skipping over 
to Assembly Lines, or All About Applesoft, or 
the reviews. Kick off your shoes, open a bottle 
of pop, and get set for this month's action- 
packed issue by reading the Contest Winners 
section first. Some of your fellow readers de- 
serving of recognition are here, and it's only po- 
lite to read their names before all those op- 
codes, mnemonics, and gosubs. 

What's in a Name? Back in December, 
when the Oracle contest was announced, we 
promised that the winner of the overall contest 
would win "Apple's next personal computer." 
At the time, people were guessing "Super II? 
Two — And Then Some? Apple IV?" If it's not 
clear by now, that's an Apple He. Sure, we con- 
sidered awarding the new Lisa computer (ten 
thousand bucks? Hey, no problem!), but how 
many games can you play on that thing, any- 
way? There's no such thing as Lisardry, Lisa- 
lifter, or even Lisa Wolfenstein. Mouskattack, 
maybe. 

With a prize such as the coveted lie at stake, 
it seemed only appropriate to open the annual 
contest with something related to Apple's new 
baby. If you had done any kind of loitering in 
Apple stores, at Apple fairs; or at an Apple 
magazine that's based in North Hollywood, 
you would have known that the new baby was 
due early in the year. 

It was no big secret; the labor pains and 
short panting emanating from Cupertino could 
be sensed across the country for months in ad- 
vance. It's a good thing Apple's not in charge of 
national security — Ivan would be on us in a 
flash. 



And So It Began. Entries poured in by the 
hundreds. We were so anxious to see who won 
that five of our mail deliverers and one post of- 
fice guard dog are now in intensive care (send 
get-well cards to Softalk Sick Bay, Box 60, 
NoHo, CA 91603). 

Just a handful of people were able to pre- 
dict the date of Apple's big day, but Larry Vir- 
den (Reynoldsburg, OH) was the one the Ran- 
dom Number Generator liked best. How'd you 
do it, Larry? 

"I just had a feeling it would be somewhere 
in the middle of January. The nineteenth was 
the middle day of the middle week, so I picked 
that day," says Virden, taking his prediction in 
stride. 

Virden wins $100 worth of prizes made by 
our advertisers, and he plans to blow it on ei- 
ther ASCII Express: The Professional or one- 
seventh of a Hayes Smartmodem 1200. 

Though Virden is off to a good start, wheth- 
er he goes on to win an Apple He in the end has 
yet to be seen; he's predicdng that the Oscar for 
Best Actress will go to Drew Barrymore for her 
performance m E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial . 

But then, anything can happen in Or- 
acle '83. 

Clueless. For all those who predicted with 
conviction that "there ain't gonna be no new 
computer" in 1983, well, what can we say? Un- 
der normal circumstances, we would sympa- 
thize with you and reconsider our ruthless scor- 
ing system (you lose 365 points). But we warned 
you! And if you don't like it, then tough 
two-ees. 

Then there were those who predicted that

The Complete 
Graphics System II 

* * by Mark Pelczarski 

Complete Graphics System is written for the non- 
programmer interested in doing a wide variety of graphics 
and design on the Apple computer. Included are options 
for two-dimensional drawing, with lines, circles, ellipses, 
and an automatic 1 08-color filling routine. Also, you can 
mix text with graphics, with various colors, sizes, and 
spacing, and easily create Apple shape tables. Three- 
dimensional options allow you to draw, edit, and 
manipulate 3-D objects in perspective — without having to 
use coordinates. A 2-disk set of additional text fonts is 
available separately. 




by Mark Pelczarski and David Lubar I 1^ 

This is also a non-programmer's package, but oriented ; 
more toward computer artistry. It's also an ideal 
complement to The Complete Graphics System II. It has 
a brush module that lets you "paint" using a joystick or 
Apple Graphics Tablet, with the screen as your canvas 
and a choice of 96 "brushes" and 108 blended colors. 
You can also magnify any portion of the screen 2 or 4 
times for detail editing, perform mirror images, exchange 
colors, and move parts of pictures to other areas of the 
screen. Also included is a packing routine that lets you 
store more pictures on each disk. 



Although both Complete Graphics System II and Special Effects are written for non-programmers, they are provided on 
unprotected disks, and instructions are included for using the graphics and machine language routines in your own programs. 



by David Lubar, Mark Pelczarski, 

and. Chris Jochumson 



This one is written with the programmer in mind; for anyone who wants to put professional quality graphics in their own 
software. Fast machine language animation and picture drawing routines are included for use in your own programs, and 
they're extremely easy to use. Using the editors provided, you simply draw your own multicolored shapes, draw their paths, 
and combine up to 32 independent shapes with paths and starting locations. The result is a machine language animation file 
that you just add and control with your own program— it does all the graphics work for you! The adventure-game picture 
editor works the same way: just draw, save, and add the redraw routine to your program. It increases a disk's storage capacity 
from 12 pictures to hundreds. A tutorial manual is included with examples of controlling animated objects with joysticks, 
detecting collisions, and a multitude of other useful hints and examples. For samples of what can be done, see any of our game 
packages, including PIE MAN, Transylvania, and Spy's Demise, as well as those from several other companies using Graphics 
Magician for the graphics in their software. 

All of. our graphics products are on unprotected disks for your convenience. "' - - ; , 

No fee is required for using our graphics routines in other programs. All our license requires is that it is stated that our 
graphics routines were used. We are also most interested in publishing good, new products, and beyond our graphics software 
we can offer further help to authors publishing through Penguin Software. 

Instead of offering our own superlatives, we recommend that you read what others have said about our graphics products. < " , '.>. '

830 4th Avenue, Geneva, IL 60134 (312) 232-1984 



MARCH 1983 




Apple would announce a new computer for '83 
but were way out in left field (June and later) 
with their guesses of when it would happen. Get 
serious, people — can't you see a clue right under 
your collective nose? 

As you may have noticed (after this part of 
the contest, we have our doubts that you did), 
the Oracle contest spreads over the course of a 
year. Each segment of the contest takes place 
during a different part of the year (National 
Collegiate Athletic Association Basketball 
Championships, Academy Awards, Kentucky 
Derby, and so on). And what do you know? We 
listed all the events in chronological order. 

Since Apple's announcement was the first 
part of this contest, doesn't it seem likely that it 
should happen toward the beginning of the 



year? Sure does. Now, before you go off to a 
corner mumbling, "I'm such a fenderhead," just 
remember that you still have a chance in the re- 
maining six parts. 

That is, unless you predicted that Ted Ken- 
nedy would announce his candidacy, or the 
Boston Celtics would win the NCAA tourna- 
ment, or Slipshod Software would make the 
most Top Thirty appearances, or. . . . 

Phantom Contest. Last January, Softalk 
was in a dam generous mood, and we decided 
to draw four hundred names at random from 
our subscription list. These four hundred lucky 
people will each win a 1983 Chrysler Cordoba 
and a year's supply of Eskimo Pies. And now 
for the winners. 

But wait! What's this? A six-foot, beer- 



PIENGUIN

(IT'S A I30Y) 



guzzling, M&M-munching penguin has just 
crashed through Softalk's front doors in a 
bumper car (how he got past our barbed-wire 
fences and guard dogs, we'll never know) and 
handed us the following bulletin: 

GENEVA, IL— Deep in the icy confines of 
their Geneva home, an allegedly innocent (and 
that is "alleged") flock of penguins recently 
was inundated by what appeared to be thou- 
sands of pieces of computer paper, file cards, 
note paper, and any other surface that could 
hold a scrap of writing. Some sixteen hundred 
fifty names rained down upon the flightless 
ones, who had to call out for pizza and beer to 
weather the storm. 

The paper blizzard consisted of entries to 
the "Anything But Smokey" contest, in which 



ARE YOU SnU LETTING YOUR PRINnR TIE UP YOUR OMPUTER? 



While your printer is running, your 
computer is tied up. You can't use it 
for processing, computing, data entry. 
Nothing. All you can do is twiddle 
your thumbs until the program is 
finished. 

Pretty ridiculous. 

MICROBUFFER Allows YOU 
TO PRINT AND PROCESS 
SIMULTANEOUSLY. 

You just dump your printing data 
directly to Microbuffer, whoosh!, and 
continue processing. No waiting. 

Microbuffer accepts data as fast as 
your computer can send it. It stores 
the data in its own memory buffer 
then takes control of your printer. 

It's that easy. 

THERE IS A MICROBUFFER 
ESPECIALLY FOR YOUR APPLE. 

Microbuffer II Oust one in the full line 
of Microbuffers) is designed to be 
specifically compatible with an Apple II 




computer. An intelligent interface card 
with up to 32K of RAM for data buffer- 
ing, Microbuffer II features on-board 
firmware for text formatting and 
advanced graphics dump routines. 
Both serial and parallel models have 
energy-efficient low power consump- 
tion coupled with a high data transfer 
rate. Print formatting functions include 
Basic listing formatter, self-test, buffer 
zap, text screen dump, fully program- 
mable control characters and 
transparent and maintain modes — 



to name only a few. 

Microbuffer II is simple to install — 
being slot-independent, it slips directly 
inside the Apple II in any slot except 
zero. The 16K model is priced at $259 
and the 32K, at $299. 

Other Microbuffer models include 
Microbuffer/ E for Epson printers and a 
stand-alone, in-line Microbuffer unit to 
untie virtually any computer/printer 
combination. 

MICROBUFFER FROM 
PRACTICAL PERIPHERALS. 

So what are you waiting for? Write to 
us for more information or ask your 
dealer for a demonstration. 

When you see how much freedom 
Microbuffer will allow, you'll 
understand why it's so silly to be 
without one.

contestants sent in their suggestions for naming 
the Penguin Software mascot. Entries ranged 
from minuscule squares of lined notebook 
paper to practically a whole forest's worth from 
an entire school district in Pennsylvania. After 
much squawking and debating, the Penguins 
reached a consensus. 

Ahem! The envelope, please . . . and the 
winnah is: Preston Penguin, submitted by 
Thomas F. Bailey (San Diego, CA). 

While chosen for its congenial sound, the 
name Preston arrived with some explanation 
from Bailey, which bears repeating. ". . . be- 
cause it evokes the mental image of Sergeant 
Preston of the Yukon (although not of his faith- 
ful sled dog, King), another cold weather fighter 
of crime and corruption. I suspect that a num- 
ber of people will have a similar brainstorm, 
and therefore request that you go by the ear- 
liest postmark of entry rather than using the 
awesome Softalk RNG." 

Actually, Tom, you were the only one to 
suggest Preston. Obviously the rest of the world 
is not as warped as you seem to think. 

The runners-up were, in order, Maynard the 
Penguin, Warren T. Penguin, Phelps Penguin, 
John Paul Penguin, Waddlesworth, Sir Ice du 
Berg, and Percival (not Percy). Maynard was 
submitted by three different people: Richard D. 
Jeffrey (Sparks, NV), Paul Aoki (Cupertino, 
CA), and Keith W. Higgins (Schertz, TX). War- 
ren T. was the offering of Ken Hendricks 
(Grand Rapids, MI). 

Phelps was submitted by Stewart E. Smith 
(Little Rock, AR), along with slogans, explana- 
tions, and an address to send "my shirt and 
directions on selecting my $100 in software." At 
least the shirt will find its way to your home, 
Stu. John Paul Penguin came from Charles E. 
Jones (Brunswick, OH), for obvious reasons. 
Waddlesworth sprang from the fertile mind of 
Eric and Sue Huffman (Santa Clara, CA). 

Sir Ice du Berg was "Penguin name #17" 
from B. A. Thale, A.P.O. Miami. Percival 
was one of the most common (along with Sher- 
lock) of the entries that made it to the final 15 — 
it was sent in by Susan Stamm (Grove City, 
PA), Lou Briscoe (Saint Charles, MO), Mi- 
chael Lempert (Haddonfield, NJ), Paige Wait 
(Eldridge, lA), Steven Peterson, Jr. (Palmdale, 
CA), Jack English (Piscataway, NJ), Dan Fine- 
man (Los Angeles, CA), John Goldie (Steam- 
boat Springs, CO), and Keith Gonzales (New 
York, NY). 

All of the above-mentioned should wait 
breathlessly by their mailboxes for the Preston 
Penguin T-shirt to arrive — as soon as we get 
them made! 

There was a host of other interesting names 
plus a number of rather boring ones. Among 
the other finalists were Sherlock, Otis, Elwood, 
Pinkerton, Drake, Diogenes ("Show me an 
honest man . . . "), lona. Agent Pengo, Pat 
Pending, Max, Sir Fishalot (Penguin name #14 
from guess who . . .), Parry, Fred, Payfer, and 
Paraquat. 

To all of those (and God knows there were a 
lot of you!) who submitted either "Penny" or 
"Pokey," please go stand in the corner and 



write "I will try to be more original next time" 
one thousand times on the nearest blackboard. 
And remember not to move your feet while 
you're doing it, regardless of the location of 
aforesaid blackboard. 

To some contest entrants the notion of a 
solitary penguin on the forefront of the piracy 
wars seemed too much to bear ... so they of- 
fered sidekicks, including (of all things) a bear! 
That notable twosome was Zarsky & Dutch, 
Dutch being the quadrupedal member of the 
team. And then there was that terrible duo of 
Captain Penguin and his backup. Mini 
Diskette. 

The award for best sound effects goes to 
John Schaller (Bridgewater, NY), who suggest- 
ed the name Protecto the Penguin. His letter 
ended with, "P.S. Remember, Protecto the Pen- 
guin says 'frnk frnk.' . . ." No, John, that's not 
what the penguins around here say; they say, 
"I'm going out for M&Ms" or "Where's the 
coffee?" 

One wag, a David Hoover (Toledo, OH), 
tried Payforit the Penguin. Another, Pete Ber- 
mel (Great Falls, VA), tried "Mule Penguin." 
His primary reason? "Mules do not repro- 
duce!" 

A frightening number of people seemed to 
have missed the point entirely, however, and 
submitted names such as Pirate, Pilfer, Lafitte, 
Blackbeak, Jailbird, and (gasp!) Jim Jones. 
The less said about these deviants, the better. 

One other frightening trend in the response 
to the name-the-f)enguin contest was the num- 
ber of double-entendres, intentional or other- 
wise. Some of the things people seemed to be 
suggesting sent the Geneva Penguins into a 
terrified huddle from which they were coaxed 
only with the greatest of exhortations and sev- 
eral six-packs. 

To wit Paddle the Penguin (ouch). Poach the 
Penguin (ouch, ouch). Pirate the Penguin (con- 
vulse, convulse). Usurp the Penguin, Pilfer the 
Penguin (hey, lemme go!), Paraquat the Pen- 
guin (choke, wheeze, gag). Boot the Penguin (no 
kicka me 'round, eh?). Snatch the Penguin, 
Punch the Penguin (says you, fella!). Muffle the 
Penguin (a popular notion, we're sure . . .), 
Prosecute the Penguin (for what?!). Chuck the 
Penguin (from the fourth floor, undoubtedly). 
Shoplift the Penguin, Jam the Penguin (oooh, 
our favorite is strawberry), Fire the Penguin 
(what'd I do, what'd I do?). Pet the Penguin (a 
wonderful idea). Putty the Penguin (silly), Puff 
the Penguin, Freeze the Penguin (a ludicrous 
suggestion at best), and Judge the Penguin (got 
that one backward, didn't you?). 

From the folks here at Penguin, many 
thanks for your participation. We all enjoyed 
reading the entries and were suitably over- 
whelmed by the response. Stay tuned for the 
further adventures of Preston Penguin. Re- 
member, only you can help prevent software 
piracy. 

We now return you to your local magazine. 

Let's see, where were we? We had a list of 
four hundred subscribers for some reason. Oh, 
well — it couldn't have been very important. Till 
next month. ...

lb Do It Right 

To make a Winchester disk for just Apple®II. 



That's how we set out to design our hard disk for 
the Apple®II. To understand the needs of serious 
users and programmers, and to correct the errors 
of our predecessors. 

You want user-friendliness. So we wrote hard disk 
versions of Apple DOS, CP/M® and Pascal that 
are highly user-friendly and loaded with 
useful features. 

□ Auto-boot hard disk 

□ Menu-driven utilities 

□ Single-keystroke program execution in DOS 

□ Disk search with wild cards, and many more 

You want flexibility. So we made every 
feature variable. 

□ From 1 to 16 operating systems on each disk 

□ Operating system spaces grow as needed 

□ Slot independence 

□ Variable size volumes (to 400K in DOS) 

□ Mountable and unmountable volumes (even in CP/M) 

□ Custom DOS allowed 

You want reliability. We use the leading drive. 
And Corona's unique data protection technology. 

□ DataGuard™ 32-bit error correction code 

□ Failsafe™ read-after-write and automatic bad-sector reallocation 

□ 2-level impact-protection packaging 



You want low-cost backup. So we wrote backup 
utilities that make floppy backup convenient. 

□ File compacting to reduce the number of floppies 

□ Volume selective backup in all operating systems 

□ Automatic diskette sequencing to ease floppy handling 

You want compatibility. We maximize compati- 
bility with existing software and peripheral cards. 

□ 9K interface card leaves main memory untouched 

□ Interrupts are allowed 

□ Boot protected floppies from slot 6 without removing hard disk 

□ Automatic slot/drive to hard disk remapping 

And you want support. We do that right too. 

□ Hardware depot service in every region 

□ Software theft-protection on the hard disk 

Compare the features that matter to you. 
And visit our local dealer or distributor for 
a demonstration. You'll see the difference 
specialization makes.

Fastalk is your quick guide to popular, special- 
ized, or classic software. Programs appearing in Fas- 
talk must meet one or more of the following criteria: 
(1) equal or surpass in sales the least-selling program 
to appear on any of the current bestseller lists; (2) re- 
late to a specialized subject area and be in general dis- 
tribution (more specialized packages and areas will be 
included as Fastalk matures); (3) be new and of pro- 
fessional quality (such programs will be carried for 
one month only — after that, they must meet other cri- 
teria for inclusion); (4) stand out as extraordinary. 

Designation as a classic is noted by a bullet pre- 
ceding a program's title. 

Where opinion is expressed, So/talk has seen the 
software in question; the date of S of talk's review, if 
any, is given at the end of the item.

Bnalk 
aliem^Dtir kids can 

instead (tfdestroi^ 




This year, thousands of hids will be 
searching for the most amazing thing 

At Spinnaker, we don't believe in the 
"kill or be killed" concept behind nnost 
computer games. In fact, we believe 
computer games should be instruc- 
tive. Mot destructive. Butjustas 
importantly, they should be fun. 

That's why Ih 5EARCM Or THE MOST 
AMAZIMQ Tf1iri(j'"is designed to let your 
kids negotiate with aliens instead of destroy- 
/ ing them. Because given the opportunity 
- kids enjoy using their minds. 
It's Amazingly Fun. 

The Most Amazing Thing is out there 
somewhere. Finding it won't be easy 
But relax, your kids will have the 
help of their old uncle Smoke Bailey 
He'll give them a B-liner (sort of a 
cross between a hot air balloon 
and a dune buggy) to use on their 
journey They'll have to learn how to 
fly the B-llner and navigate it through 
storms and fog. But before they do 
anything, your kids will have to talk to Old 
Smoke. He'll tell them about the Mire People 
and the strange language that they speak, fle'll 
also tell them to avoid the dangerous Mire 
Crabs and how to get fuel for the B-liner 

Your kids will visit the Metallican Auction 
where they'll trade with the aliens for valuable 
chips. Your kids will then use these chips to buy 
things they'll need for their trip. And your kids 
will learn how to fly over the planet using their 
jet pack. 

The Most Amazing Thing 
holds great powers, but it will 
take great skill, persistence 
and imagination to find it. 
It's Amazingly Educational. 

Ih SEARCH OF THE MOST 
AMAZIMC: THIMQ is written by 
Tom Snyder, educator and 
author of the best-selling 
Snooper Troops'" Detective 

Series. 

And like all Spinnaker games, Ih 
SEARCH OF THE MOST AMAZIhQ THIhQ has rea 
educational value. For instance, your kids wi 
sharpen their ability to estimate distances and 




quantities. And since they'll be navi- 
gating their B-liner, they'll become aware 
of distance, direction and time. They'll also 
develop a knack for economic and monetary 
principles through trading with the aliens. 
And they'll solve problems through trial 
and error 

They'll learn all of these things, plus they'll 
learn that nothing is impossible if you put your 
mind to it. 

A Move! Approach to Computer Games. 

Besides offering your children all of the above, 
Ih SEARCH OF THE MOST AMAZIhQ THIhQ gives 
them an opportunity to develop their reading 
skills. Because included with the game is Jim 
Morrow's new novel Th e Adventures of Smoke 
Baile y* So your children will have hours of fun 
reading the book or playing the game. And 
they'll be learning at the same time. 
Parental Discretion Advised. 

If you're a parent who would rather see your 
kids reason with aliens than destroy them, 
you've got plenty of reasons to 
ask your local software retailer 
for Ih SEARCH OF THE MOST 
AMAZIhQ ThIMQ. It's compatible 
with Apple,® IBM,® Atari,® and 
Commodore 54™ computers. 
And it offers so much fun you'll 
probably be tempted to play it yoi 
Or you can write us directly at: 
Spinnaker Software, 215 First Street, 
Cambridge, MA 02142. 

You'll find this is one computer game that 
won't alienate you from your 





We make learning fun.

500% Faster Loading of Textfiles , Integer, Applesoft & Binary 
and Now Six Powerful Extra Commands In Standard DOS 3.3 



30 out of 60 bought it on the spot when DAVID-DOS " was 
demonstrated at the Original Apple Corps, UCLA. 



Automatically supports an Integer or Apple- 
soft Rom Card in anv slot (without configuring). 

Six New Commands 

1. TLOAD Speed loads all Text Files. 

2. TLIST Lists all Text Files to screen/printer. 

3. DUMP Binarv/Ascii to screen or printer. 

4. DISA Disassembles Binary to screen/printer. 

5. AL Prints program Address & Length. 

6. HIDOS DOS moves itself to Language Card 

Like Other DOS Commands 

These six commands operate identical to ex- 
isting DOS commands. UseAor A$ foraddress 
and L or L$ for length. Enter them on the 
Keyboard and use them in Basic programs with 
the familiar D$. 

100 Sectors in 7 Seconds 

TLOAD loads a Visacalc Template of a hundred 
sectors in 7 seconds and TLIST scrolls it to 
screen or printer. TLOAD speed loads Se- 
quential and Random Text Files starting at 
$1000 or as specified bv A. It loads the entire 
file or a smaller length specified by L. 

List Any Textfile 

TLIST lists Sequential and Random Text Files 
to screen and printer. 



DUMP screen dumps memorv with Ascii along 
the right side. Use A and L for specific dumps. 
Without them it starts at $00 and stops with 
return. 

Disassemble Machine Code 

DISA disassembles machine code to screen. 
Use A and L for spec ifit routines. 

Variable Speed Scrolling 

TLIST, DUMP and DISA Features; 

1. Print with PR# 

2. Key operated variable speed control. 

3. Instant pause with Space Bar. 

4. Exit anytime with Return Key. 

10K More of Memory

to the card at SDDOO. Himem is set at SBEOO 
adding lOK of free memor\' for programs. The 
Integer Card is still automatically supported in 
any slot. $300 to $3D0 is kept free. 

Apple' II ami Applesofi are trademarks iil Apple Computer inc. 



Two More New Commands 

HIDOS has all previous commands and features 
operational and adds a 7th command FIND, 
Find searches 64K memorv in 3 seconds for 
any Hex sequence up to 31 bytes long and 
prints the addresses to screen. Hidos has an 
optional 8th command DATE configured for 
Mountain Hardware clocks and is useable in 
basic programs. 

Use with Most Software 

DAVID-DOS is totally accurate and speed 
loads without over-writing. Great care was 
taken to keep DOS standard and compatible 
with most software. All DOS entry addresses 
have been preserved. Only two routines were 
moved to allow more room in command 
tables. DOS is the same length. Init areas were 
used for DAVID-DOS, 

Install in Seconds 

Catalog Free Space is also provided. DAVID- 
DOS installs in seconds on blank or full disks. 
Requires a 48K Apple II with DOS 3.3.

Give your child the thinking tools 
that stand in a class by themselves: 
progTcims for your home from 
Computer-Advanced Ideas. 

For The Fun Of It 

As professional educators and 
programmers we've been proving 
for over a decade that motivated 
learners do best. Featuring full-color 
graphics, our animated learning 
games are fun. They talk like a 
friend, play like a teammate and 
teach like a tutor. And they stimulate 
eager young minds. 

Partners In Learning 

CAI programs come with a library of 
knowledge for your child to explore. 
But that's just the beginning. They 
also feature a unique authoring 
system that lets you create lessons 
on any subject, tailoring the 
program to your child's needs. No 
knowledge of computers is required. 
Our programs make sense to people 
— from 4 to 94 — and grow right 
along with your child. 

A Success In Schools 

Over 1800 school districts have 
chosen CAI programs to teach 
essential vocabulary and logic skills 
in a full range of topics. Our products 
get recognition— because they work. 

Head Start 

Your child's future begins with 
opportunities you create at home. 
Choosing resources that are 
stimulating, challenging and fun can 
be one of the best decisions you 
make. Ask your computer retailer 
for a demonstration of CAI 
programs and see for yourself how 
enjoyable a good education can be.

Format H. 
Word processing 
so advanced 
anyone can use it. 



Format n was tBSted for six 
months in the demanding 
arena of Wall Street. Dis 
tnbuted by local deal- 
ers to law firms, finan- 
cial institutions, and 
the like, Format n was 
used by secretaries and 
non-technical personnel. Overwhelm- 
ingly Format U was recognized as one of the easi- 
est and most effective word processing systems 
available in anyfonn. 

Here's why Format n is unique among word 
processing programs: 

What you see is what you get. Format n 
performs virtually any editing and formatting func- 
tion you can imagine and displays on the screen 
the text exactly as it will print out — paragraphs, 
underlining, justification, page breaks. 
Simple to Use. You edit and format text with 
single key strokes. "D" for delete, "E" for edit, "I" for 
insert, "J" for justify etc. Easy-to-remember com- 
mands because they make sense. 



It supports all 
printers compat- 
ible with the Apple. 
Shadow printing, bold- 
facing, proportional 
spacing, sub- and super- 
scripting are all available. 
Includes a sophisticated 
Mailing List. Stores and re- 
trieves names and addresses 
which may be printed on labels or incorporated 
into documents. Powerful "logic" commands allow 
you to select only those records which match 
specified criteria. 

And more. Format n is lightning fast and 
menu driven. Add them all together and it's clear 
why Format U has generated such enthusiasm. 
Nowf at a cost of $250, you too can buy the best. 

Format U is available from most local dealers. 
If not, ask them to contact us, or order directly and 
receive a 30 day money-back guarantee.

System Requiiements: 48K Apple'"' n Plus with 80 column card. 



System Saver 

The most important peripheral for your Apple II. 





Fbr Line Surge Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides es- 
sential protection to hardware and 
data from dangerous power surges 
and spikes. 




Volts 
RMS 



SYSTEM SAVEH 
APPLE II 



By connecting the Apple II 
power input through the SYSTEM 
SAVER, power is controlled in two 
ways: 1) Dangerous voltage spikes 
are clipped off at a safe 130 Volts 
RMS/175 Volts dc level. 2) High fre- 
quency noise IS smoothed out be- 
fore reaching the Apple H. A PI type 
filter attenuates common mode 
noise signals by a minimum of 
30 dB from 600 khz to 20 mhz, with 
a maximum attenuation of 50 dB. 



For Cooling 

As soon as you move to 64K RAM 
or 80 columns on your Apple n you 
need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral 
cards generate more heat. In addi- 
tion, the cards block any natural air 
flow through the Apple n creating 
high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the 
cards and the computer itself. 



For Operating Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two 
switched power outlets. As shown 
in the diagram, the SYSTEM 
SAVER efficiently organizes your 
system so that one convenient, 
front mounted 
power switch 
controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple H, 
monitor and printer. 



MONiTOR 








APPLE II 




SYSTEM SAVER provides cor- 
rect cooling. An efficient, quiet fan 
draws fresh air across the mother 
board, over the power supply and 
out the side ventilation slots. 



The heavy duty switch has a 
pilot light to alert when system is 
on .You '11 never use the Apple power 
switch again! 



Easy Installation 



Just clips on. 
No mounting or 
hardware required. 
Color matched 
to Apple n.

YOU PROVIDE THE EQUATIONS AND THE CALFEX 
PROGRAM WILL DO ALL THE TEDIOUS WORK. 
CALFEX is a generalized program for problems which 
must be solved in terms of mathematical equations. Given 
a set of input values. CALFEX will calculate the answers 
and display or print the results. Variables may be given 
names or labels. Input values are very easily changed to 
see the effect on the answers. 



A GREAT TIMESAVER. Easy to learn and even easier to 
use. CALFEX eliminates all the input, output and printing 
statements which were often the majority of your pro- 
gramming time. Many programs can be created in minutes 
instead of hours or days. You get the answers you need 
.sooner, thrtjugh a clearl y understandable format. 

AY* + Ycos (Y + Z) 
^ l+BYMn(Z/YJ 
Solve for y? With VARIABLE 
EXCHANGE, CALFEX will do it 
for you. 

VARLXBLE EXCHANGE allows the effective exchange of 
any dependent variable with an independent. This power- 
ful feature is of great importance, since it s frequently 
difficult or impossible to solve your equations analytically 
for a given variable. Also it is not always obvious in ad- 
vance which variables should be the dependent ones. With 
CALFEX you can very easily exchange the variables at any 

time. 

SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS, NUMERICAL INTE- 
GRATION, MAXIMA AND MINIMA can all be handled by 
CALFEX. Up to 10 simultaneous equations can be solved. 
Maxima and minima are often useful. Built in constants 
and functions simplify your task. Up to 120 inputs and 
120 outputs are available in simple or array variables. You 
can separately record up to 10 sets of inputs, or default 
values. 

NO LTMIQUE SYMBOLS OR LANGUAGE TO LEARN. 
CALFEX is a menu driven program. You need only write 
the part which contains your calculations. Most problems 
can be .solved without prior programming experience. Yet 
if needed, you have access to normal BASIC programming 
to help solve your problem. 

ORGANIZED AND DOCUMENTED PROGRAMS ARE 
easy with CALFEX. Your programs, theory and diskettes 
are easily organized and may then he kept in the binder 
Extra diskette holders are also provided. Finally you can 
have a consistent documentation system, which other peo- 
ple can understand. 

APPLICATIONS PROGRAMS are being developed for 
various engineering disciplines including mechanical and 

electrical engineering.

SOFTLINE 




What if they gave out cardboard Oscars for 
negative achievements along with the real ones? 

Here at Softline, the same off-the-wall 
question occurred to us. And we decided to do 
something about it. 

We asked our readers what they thought was 
the worst game they had encountered in 1982. At 
the same time we asked our Atari readers what 
they thought was the best Atari program of 1982. 

You can find the results of both of these polls 
in the next issue of Softline, available in the last 
two weeks of March. 



Compare the worst Atari programs and the worst Apple 
programs. Compare the best Atari programs, as voted by the readers 
o( Softline, and the best Apple programs, as voted by the readers of 
Softalk (results to be published in the April issue). 

Don't miss out on the fun and the agony.

Buffed and Shining 

I have been a reader of your publication since 
its inception and have always enjoyed your arti- 



as to how I liked my card. I said that it did every- 
thing that I wanted and I was very satisfied. He 
then asked about dumping graphics, since this 
was to be his reason for buying this card. I 
thought of the trouble I had had and figured I'd 
give it one more try. After repeated failures, I 
assumed that something was wrong with the 
card. I then started calling dealers to ask how to 
resolve my problem. I was given answers rang- 
ing from "You need another card to dump 
graphics" to "Your card can't dump graphics to 
a C. Itoh printer — only to an Epson." 

Still upset with the whole ordeal, I called 



Apple Writers Write 

Over the past year I have seen a number of let- 
ters and comments lamenting the fact that 
Apple Writer 1. 1 will not let the user access all 
the features of a specific printer. Well, there is 
an inexpensive program out there that will let 
you do it. This letter was written with Apple 
Writer 1.1 on an Apple II Plus and an NEC 
8023A-C printer. The key to the system is a rou- 
tine called the Universal Text Formater by Zig- 
gurat Software. 

The Universal Text Formater generates a 
replacement printer routine for the one that 
comes with Apple Writer. It will work with 
virtually any printer, since you load in your 
specific printer control codes prior to installing 
it on the Apple Writer disk. It allows you to 
underline, change print styles, access the NEC 
Greek alphabet, print double width, enhance 
the print, and more. The first public listing I had 
seen on the program was in So/talk's Stocking

Discussion because I feel that the consumer 
should be heard and listened to. Being in retail 
myself, I make it my job to listen and take ac- 
tion on any complaint or question. All too often 
people will jump at a problem but won't say 
anything when a fine job is done. I enjoy read- 
ing both sides of the story in Open Discussion. 
I've written to praise a company that I feel went 
"above and beyond" in order to help. That 
company is Practical Peripherals of Westlake 
Village, California. 

I purchased a Microbuffer II from my 
dealer a few months ago in order to speed up 
the interaction between my Apple and my 
printer. The card did everything it was sup- 
posed to but I was having trouble dumping 
graphics. Since this was not the primary reason 
for owning the Microbuffer, I figured I was just 
doing something wrong and promptly forgot 
about it. 

A few weeks ago, a friend of mine inquired 



Practical Peripherals. The person on the other 
end of the phone listened to my story and then 
told me I had the wrong chip in the card and 
that the chip I needed does exist. I gave her my 
name and address and I figured they would 
send me an order form for the chip. I sat back 
and waited. 

Two days later UPS delivered a package 
shipped Blue Label from Practical Peripherals. I 
opened it and my chip was inside. No ques- 
tions asked, no bill, no hassles, no problem! I 
was extremely happy. I put the new chip in my 
card and it dumped the graphics like it should 
have. I called my friend and told him of my 
success and he immediately went out and 
bought a Microbuffer II card, requesting that 
the proper chip be installed. 

My hat is off to Practical Peripherals. All com- 
panies should offer such fine and prompt serv- 
ice. I highly recommend this product to readers 
with the confidence that they will experience the 
same excellent service and response that I have.

StufTers. It makes Apple Writer one of the 
simpler and more flexible word processors 
available. 

Ziggurat also produces a proportional text 
formatter for NEC and Centronics printers. I 
think it's the best of all, since it allows me to 
utilize the proportional print on the NEC and 
still keep the margins straight. It also allows 
underiining, double width, and enhanced print. 
These two programs have kept me tied to Apple 
Writer because I have not found another that 
can match these features. 
Eric L. Oshlo, Katy, TX 

I am an Apple Writer II user but have seen few 
published programs using the Word Processing 
Language. If anyone has seen programs, I 
would like to know sources. I'd like to be able 
to search several letters for key words and print 
parts of the letters, and use WPL as a database 
management system, searching, sorting, and 
alphabetizing files. I wish to load several files in 
sequence with a return after each one so that the

files load left-justified. Sometimes this works 
and someUmes it doesn't. Does anyone know 
why? 

If Apple Computer is reading, I would like 
to make the following suggestions. First, I 
would never recommend anyone buying an Ap- 
ple through a store. Even the best stores have 
one goal — to get your money with minimal ef- 
fort (translated: service). Rather, I would sug- 
gest that Apple heavily support user groups. 
Any novice buying a computer would be well 
served by joining such a group and becoming 
knowledgeable about computing before pur- 
chasing — then buying price and only price. An 
Apple is an Apple. 

Second, the Apple keyboard is not well de- 
signed for speedy typists like myself. The keys 
have a peculiar feel — not smooth, not respon- 
sive enough. Even so, I can go much faster on 
the Apple than on my very expensive typewrit- 
er (which costs more than the computer). IBM 
is looking for customers, and in this price range 
these details count. 

The free market allowed Apple to flourish. I 
think it should confinue to do so. What is sup- 
port to one person is a burden to another. I 
think most buyers are more sophisficated than 
Apple wants to admit. In other words, I think 
you should get your product sold in the most 
outlets available at the best price possible. 
Robert R. Hall, Nantucket, MA 

A Marginal Problem 

I have recently purchased the new Apple dot 
matrix impact printer. I am having trouble 
setting the margins with Apple Writer 1.1. Can 
anyone help me with this problem? 
Daniel Wambold, Glen Rock, NJ 

Brand X Rated 

I'm writing to comment on the IVord Handler 
word processor and to supplement the com- 
ments by Matthew Machis (October Open Discus- 
sion). I have only a little experience with "Brand 
X" processor; it was nearly a battle every time I 
tried to write a letter. It had so many necessary 
requirements that actual writing was not an 
easy task. It wouldn't even underhne, whereas 
Word Handler does it with one easy command. 
It has other features too, such as headers and 
footers, print control and retypes, easy center- 
ing, right justification, and so on. 

I especially want to give a great big pat on 
the back to Silicon Valley. I had a grave prob- 
lem arise and called collect, as they advised, and 
talked to Tony Garcia, their director of cus- 
tomer service. He understood at once what the 
problem was and graciously solved it for me 
promptly and at no charge. My advice for 
anyone who is in the market for a friendly word 
processor is to have a look at Word Handler. 
For my money, it's a good product, backed up 
by a good company. 
B. W. Muir, Parker, CO 

Just the Ticket for Speeding 

In recent benchmark comparisons between the 
Apple II and the IBM pc that I've seen in other 
magazines, the Apple fared quite well on com- 



putationally intensive tests (about 20 percent 
slower overall). On any disk measures it was sig- 
nificantly slower (about six times slower). I 
would like to call attention to a remarkable 
product that helps equalize this difference. It is 
Diversi-DOS by Diversified Software Research. 

This product provides an improvement of at 
least a factor of four on disk operations and 
also adds a print buffer (uses RAM card), a 
keyboard buffer for type-ahead, and an 
optional DOS mover to move Diversi-DOS 
to the RAM card. I purchased the product 
through my Apple club, and since the original 
purchase I have received two updates. The 
product is the most useful Apple utility I have, 
since it allows the Apple to match IBM pc per- 
formance in the DOS area, as well as giving me 
an additional 12K of addressable RAM. It is an 
amazing bargain at $30. 
Edwin M. Winter, Camarillo, CA 

Smatter of Reactions 

Softalk is my favorite magazine. I have used an 
Apple for a year now in my work and I take it 
home on the weekends too. VisiCalc, Apple 
Writer, VisiTrend/VisiPlot, and other miscel- 
laneous Apple programs are my Apple's best 
friends. I find VisiFile confusing, cumbersome, 
and disk-intensive, and the hard copy is not pre- 
sentable to higher management. Spitfire Simu- 
lator seems slow and boring, while Horizon V 
represents the true potential of the Apple. My 
highest praise must go to the Beagle Bros for 
their Apple Mechanic. Not only is this fully 
packed disk useful and efficient — it's fun! 
Allan Porter, New Braunfels, TX 

Trickster's Cul-de-sac 

Before I discuss how Bag of Tricks proved its 
worth to me, let me say that the trouble I had 
that was destroying not only my original disk 
but the backup as well was spreading like a ma- 
lignant disease to a third disk too. It may have 
been due to my using Wabash disks. I had a 
good amount of trouble with these disks. A 
number of them were unbootable and gave the 
useless and frustrating I/O message when I at- 
tempted to load, bload, and catalog. 

The original disk failed totally after increas- 
ingly erratic behavior as I was doing upgrades 
on a game that I was hand-compiling. My notes 
and a fortunate backup copy alone enabled me 
to rebuild after the disk totally quit on me. The 
backup had never been bootable, but it had 
served well when asked to save or load. Then, 
I/O errors resulted when I attempted to load 
large files from it for reconstruction work on 
my games. 

After finally transferring data to a third 
disk and rebuilding my work, I then began writ- 
ing the new Hello file to a menu driver. To 
my unpleasant surprise, when I did a save to the 
disk, the two locked binary files on an adven- 
ture game were mangled into R files with gib- 
berish names. Adding to my frustration was the 
response of the computer when I tried to un- 
lock the first of these monstrosities that had re- 
placed a vital binary file. The response was an 
I/O error.

MARCH 1983 



Having used Bag of Tricks the evening be- 
fore to locate the trouble in the failing backup 
disk (all sectors proved readable, at least in one 
attempt; so I was assured that success would 
eventually occur), I processed the inexplicably 
injured catalog through the Fixcal utility. It lo- 
cated and reported the damaged, intractable 
files; so I cleaned up the catalog. It also detect- 
ed errors in other places, corrected as well, that 
should only occur on an old disk. I was able to 
resume work from where the damage occurred. 
It seems to me that Wabash was responsible for 
this trouble, or perhaps I got a bad set of disks 
in the box I bought. In the future I will ask for 
another brand, as I do not want this trouble 
again. Bag of Tricks saved me two weeks of 
work. 

Paul R. Wilson, New York, NY 
Wealth of Notions 

Wow! What a rich field for discussion in the 
January '83 issue! My first comment has to be 
on the Smith/Pelczarski brouhaha (An 
Interface of Responsibilities). I feel eminently 
qualified to comment on the whole thing, since I 
am a consumer, software dealer, and hardware 
(Franklin) dealer. I'd like to put my twenty 
cents in (postage, y'know). First, what about the 
dealer caught in the middle of this? On the one 
hand I fully support Mark Pelczarski's position 
that piracy is theft, and no amount of left- 
handed logic says anything else. But, as a con- 
sumer (dealers do not get free copies to demon- 
strate), I understand J. Barry Smith's gripe: 
Why are we forced to pay twice for programs? 
By this I mean the practice by some companies 
of forcing you to pay for backup copies of 
programs you've already bought. The only 
solution I can see is to provide reputable, au- 
thorized dealers with copyable programs from 
which to make backups for the people who've 
paid for the software — but only upon presenta- 
tion of a bad copy. This would give consumers 
an alternative to paying twice for software, 
spending days or weeks waiting for replace- 
ment disks, or turning into pirates. (Mr. Smith: 
If you deal with a good dealer, you will receive 
the support you desire.) 

Secondly, is there some question as to 
whether or not Franklin Ace owners are fit to 
talk to? I wasn't aware that owning a Franklin 
was equivalent to having a social disease! In 
answer to Mr. Smith's question, of course we 
should be "allowed" into the "fraternity/soror- 
ity." We have all paid good money for 
our machines and it so happens that they 
use the same software as yours. Does the ques- 
tion mean that if you own a Dynabyte com- 
puter you won't talk to a Cromemco user be- 
cause they both run CP/M, and Cromemco 
and Dynabyte are therefore in competition? To 
address Mr. Smith's other question: Yes, the 
Franklin Ace will indeed run Apple software. I 
often boot my system with a copy of DOS 3.3. 
It works fine. In fact, I've never come across 
anything that will not run. It is often necessary 
to put on the alpha lock to get it to run, but this 
is because an unmodified Apple does not have 
lower-ca.se capability. 



As to Eric Anderson (Smoldering in the 
Stacks), I think I would be happier with DB 
Master if, when a file's data goes over the capa- 
city of a single disk, I did not have to keep 
swapping disks as the program makes room on 
the original for the new data. This is caused by 
the program's putting all records in first record 
order. It is a supreme pain, and, according to 
Stoneware's technical support group, the only 
solution is to buy its Utility Pak #/ to merge 
parts of the file that have been broken up to fit 
on one disk. 

Enough of my gripes; hope to see more on 
these matters upcoming in Open Discussion. 
Jeffery R. Partridge, president. Pear Tree 
Computer Services, Poughkeepsie, NY 

In Search Of 

I'm trying to establish personal archives of 
early Apple software and associated printed 
material. Specifically, I'm looking for system 
masters with manuals prior to DOS 3.2, early 
disks, cassettes, manuals, listings, and blank 
disks with the small "disk 11" logo. I already 
have disk copies of contributed programs, vol- 
umes one through five, both cassette demo 
packages, and a few Red Book programs. I also 
have the manuals for the contributed programs 
and the cassette demos. 

If anyone can help me, I'd sure like to hear 
from them through Open Discussion.

Nibble Quibble 

Anyone who has ever invited some friends over 
to play that new supergame to end all games, 
only to have it refuse to load, realizes that game 
program owners have a legitimate right to a 
backup copy. Software pubhshers, on the other 
hand, have a right to protect their investment 
through copy protection. Another point rele- 
vant to the games issue is that it really is not 
necessary to be able to modify a game program. 
As I see it, there exist two methods of keeping 
everybody happy. Either allow the one copy to 
make one more copy (thank you, Roger Wag- 
ner), or supply two copies of the program. 

In addition, since disks do wear out, there 
should be a small, but reasonable, cost to re- 
place blown disks (subject to inflation, the value 
of the dollar, the price of gold, and the avail- 
ability of 2 percent yak's milk). 

As a result of this action, the need for nib- 
ble copiers will have been eliminated, accord- 
ing to the reasoning of their producers, who ar- 
gue that software publishers have not satisfied 
the user's legitimate right to back up because of 
copy protection. Unfortunately, before copy 
protection, users abused .this privilege and 
brought about copy protection because they 
violated the rights of the software publishers. 

At this point, would it be possible for the 
software publisher who is providing acceptable 
backup to cooperate with the nibble copiers and 
add a code (in addition to any copy protection 
he might wish to use) that would be recognized 
by the nibble copier, and would then refuse to 
make what could only be an illegitimate copy? I 
realize that there are legal questions involved. 



but I feel that there is potential here. 

Nowadays most Apple owners are users 
who don't know enough to crack a proteaion 
scheme, and most of those who do only do so to 
provide a legitimate backup. If the backup al- 
ready existed they wouldn't take the time. I'm 
sure there are others who are hard-core pirates, 
but I think most pirates are using nibble copiers, 
and my suggestion would, therefore, solve most 
of the problem. Stricter legal penalties for the 
remainder would also help. 

Most of what I say pertaining to games will 
also apply to business programs, but businesses 
do differ in that they have a legitimate need for 
more copies. When several individuals or de- 
partments use a program it is very awkward to 
have only one or two copies. On the other hand, 
a software publisher can't afford to sell one 
copy of a program to the United States govern- 
ment that in turn will make 5,000 copies for its 
employees. I think a satisfactory solution can be 
arrived at by studying noncopyable hardware. 

One computer can be shared by several in- 
dividuals or departments, but eventually either 
use or convenience will result in more comput- 
ers being bought. Why not limit the number of 
copies (available at a reduced price) to a figure 
based on the number of computers at a given lo- 
cation? This will require the cooperation of Aj> 
ple Computer and careful serial number regis- 
tration, but it will also tend to limit theft, since 
attempts to buy backup software will turn up 
stolen computers. As a concession to the exis- 
tence of nibble copiers, the backups would have 
to be available at a price greatly reduced from 
that of backup hardware. 

This brings me to one final point, which I'm 
sure will be disputed. (I had to come up with 
something to make everybody unhappy.) The 
current trend in business programs is to include 
all necessary documentation within the pro- 
gram. I disagree! This wastes RAM (causing 
unnecessary disk accesses, garbage collections, 
and so on) and disk space (read extra disks and 
disk swapping). Since most of this excess bag- 
gage is only needed until the user is familiar 
with the program, why not leave it in the man- 
ual? By adopting this procedure, software pub- 
lishers would raise the pirated price because the 
documentation would also have to be copied. 
Now all we have to do is find a way to satisfy 
users of business programs who want to modi- 
fy their programs.

Gestation Ended 

I have been receiving Softalk for nine months 
now and I continue to be amazed by the consis- 
tently high quality of this publication. I have 
read other computer-oriented magazines, but 
none manage to provide such fascinating and 
informative insights into the worid of the Apple 

II as Softalk does. However, I do have some 
suggestions that I hope will be of use to you, as 
well as some comments about what is perhaps 
the most hotly debated issue in the micro- 
computer industry. 

First of all, with regard to Edward Isen- 
berg's letter that opened January's Open

Discussion, I do think that WordStar deserves 
some attention for consistently placing in the 
Top Thirty. In fact, I am certain that such con- 
tinued sales success demonstrates a product's 
worthiness far more conclusively than does a 
sudden, meteoric rise and fall in the Top 
Thirty. I propose that Softalk include another 
heading in the Top Thirty list "Weeks on List." 
This would give the readers an accurate impres- 
sion of a particular product's continued success 
in the marketplace, and this is what matters in 
the long run. 

I definitely feel that a new category of soft- 
ware should be implemented to provide a niche 
for new programs such as Castle Wolfenstein 
and Aztec, which clearly do not belong under 
any of the present categories. These programs, 
which combine the aesthetic pleasures of fan- 
tasy-adventuring with the finger-pounding 
excitement of arcade-gaming, seem to be the 
wave of the future. Why not begin a new cate- 
gory called ArcadeVenture (or something like 
that) to fill the present gap? 

Also, I think Softalk should be more con- 
sistent when classifying programs, both in 
Fastalk and in the Bestsellers. It is confusing to 
the reader when he sees, for example, Prisoner 2 
categorized as an adventure in Fastalk but as a 
fantasy in the Bestsellers. 

I am disappointed with Marketalk Re- 
views. Your software reviews give a good idea 
of the features in a program; however, these re- 
views are so rarely negative that one is left un- 
certain of the reviewer's objectivity. Let's face it, 
most programs (like most movies, books, and 
works of art) are of mediocre quality. People 
shouldn't esteem the critic who praises almost 
everything that comes his way. 

Finally, some words about software piracy. 
I really cannot sympathize with the major soft- 
ware houses that bemoan the rampant piracy 
taking place among Apple users. These com- 
panies do not seem to realize that the end to pi- 
racy lies not in the hands of the consumer but in 
the hands of the publishers who in vain try to 
prevent piracy by expensive copy protection. 
Copy protection is not only futile — for more 
and more expert software crackers are ap- 
pearing all the time — but in the final analysis it 
encourages the very piracy it attempts to pre- 
vent, by driving up the price of software be- 
yond the reach of most money-conscious con- 
sumers. I therefore applaud Penguin Software 
and especially Beagle Bros (the latter sells no 
copy-protected software); after studying the 
Bestsellers Hobby category, it is obvious to me 
that these companies are benefiting financially 
from their unprotected software policies. Only 
when the other software houses realize the value 
of this will the vicious circle of software piracy 
be ended. Until that day the software user 
should not be expected to listen to the pleas of 
companies that sell ultraexpensive, copy-pro- 
tected software.

Problems with ED 

To Greg Tibbetts: I am an owner of an Apple II 
Plus with the Microsoft Z-80 card and the 



Videx Videoterm card with Softswitch. I also 
have a 16K RAM card in slot 0. SoftCard 
Symposium is the column that I look forward 
to the most among the myriad of computer 
magazines that I receive to satisfy my computer 
addiction. I have found no other source of 
information on this subject as informative and 
well written. 

I'm interested in the idea of a user group for 
Apple CP/M in which the special case of the 
Apple in the context of commercial CP/M soft- 
ware could be intensively considered. Among 
other things, ideas for optimally installing the 
various packages on the Apple or Apple/Videx 
terminal would be of great value. Similarly, 
6502 assembly language subroutines that could 
be run from inside a program such as dBase II 
would represent a welcome area of discussion. 
Perhaps SoftCard Symposium could initiate 
interest in the formation of such a group, in 
which I would be happy to take an active role. 

I also have one specific question. Is there 
any way to alter ED.COM so that it defaults to 
-U instead of U, so that translation from 
lower to upper case will not take place? 
D. Pulver, Riverdale, NY 

Greg Tibbetts responds: 

Thank you for the kind words about the col- 
umn. I will certainly mention your ideas con- 
cerning the creation of an Apple CP/M user 
group in an upcoming column. Due to the time 
lag between their creation and appearance, 
however, there will be some delay. I wish you 
luck in the formation of such a group and 
would suggest that you consider contacting 
CP/M user group bulletin boards for prospec- 
tive members, since they often have Apple 
CP/M subgroups. 

Regarding your problems with ED, you will 
find that ED does not really default to U, upper 
case lock, as you suspect. If you enter the 
I(nsert) in upper case, it will default to upper 
case for that insert session. If you enter the 
i(nsert) in lower case, it will default to lower

Try and Try Again 

I read with great interest Mind Your Business in 
the October Softalk. What caught my attention 
was the section entitled "Trying Before Buy- 
ing." At the end of this section Peter Olivieri in- 
dicated that he would like to see an operation in 
which the software could be tried out by the 
prospective customer. 

I opened just this type of store in Bloom- 
ington (Minneapolis), Minnesota, at the end of 
last year. The store is called The Softwaire 
Centre and, as the name implies, our product 
will be software. We will sell business (includ- 
ing CP/M), utilities, education, and entertain- 
ment programs. In addition, we will carry a very 
complete selection of books and magazines. We 
will sell no hardware, but we will have two Ap- 
ples, one IBM pc, one Xerox 820, one Atari

800, and one TRS-80 III in the store on which 
our customers can try the software before pur- 
chasing. As we do not sell the hardware, we will 
be able to give customers an unbiased opinion 
as to the best type of equipment to purchase, 
based on the type of software they will be run- 
ning. In other words, you will be able to try 
three or four word processing programs before 
purchase. There would be no cost to the 
customer for this service other than the pro- 
gram, should he decide to purchase one. 

We are affiliated on a franchise basis with 
Softwaire Centres International of Culver City, 
California. Although we should be one of the 
first stores to open outside of California, there 
are successful Softwaire Centre operations in 
Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, and 
Pasadena. Stores in Torrance and Oakland 
were scheduled to open approximately the same 
time as mine.

Creepy Errors That Reach the Core 

Jeff Mazur's October '82 Hardtalk on the game 
I/O connector was greatly appreciated. It 
prompts me to ask a question I have previously 
put to Call —A.P.P.L.E. as well as the person- 
nel at Cupertino — without any reply. 

In the reference manual (mine is a 1979 is- 
sue), table 9 on page 24 lists the location ad- 
dresses of the four annunciators for the auto- 
start ROM. I assume that these are the correct 
addresses (at least they are the same as in the 
Red Book!). But on pages 137 and 143 of the 
reference manual, they are reversed in the 
monitor listings. And the ROM responds 
accordingly. 

My question is, did I get an autostart ROM 
that was "burned in" wrong, and, if so, have 
later editions of the reference book been 
changed? 

It is a bother to put in inverters on any 
prototype board that uses these annunciator ad- 
dresses; and I do have a few boards such as the 
one for the GALFO RTTY interface. Without 
the inverters the boot brings in the interface al- 
ready keying my transmitter. Also, if this board 
is active, any other program called causes the 
annunciator to key the PTT circuit if my radio 
transmitter happens to be on. To prevent that, I 
have had to add a poke —16293 as the first 
statement of all programs, or pull the cable 
from the game I/O socket. Very messy! 

I suppose the best thing to do would be to 
burn a new ROM. But I'd first like to find out if 
I am alone in this problem. Has Apple done a 
fix for later issues of both the ROM and the ref- 
erence manual? 

James A. Johnston, Pearl City, HI 

Jeff Mazur responds: 

To James Johnston: Thanks for the letter. The 
discrepancies you have discovered are not due 
to different versions of the autostart ROM. 
What you have found is simply some of the er- 
rors that crept into the reference manual. As 
you correctly guessed, the addresses shown on 
pages 137 and 143 are wrong. For a complete 



(well, almost!) list of the more than forty such 
inaccuracies, check with your local Internation- 
al Apple Core member club. The Core has a 
large volume of technical notes that includes er- 
rata information on Apple publications. If you 
don't have a club nearby, you should contact

Resolute Reaction 

In the October '82 Hardtalk, Jeff Mazur men- 
tioned the use of a lOOK pot plus capacitor 
with Apple II game paddle inputs. First, a picky 
technical point. While the circuit diagram in the 



column, page 192, shows a 74LS259 address- 
able latch at board position F-14, most Apple 
lis have a 9334 at this location. The 9334 is a 
twin of the 74259; thus the switch is from 
LS-TTL to plain vanilla TTL. Some of your 
readers might be confused by the difference. In- 
cidentally, the switch was made in the other di- 
rection on the disk controller card. The sche- 
matics distributed with the DOS 3.3 manuals (at 
least the series mine came from) show a 9334 
on the card. The controller card itself, however, 
has a 74LS259 in that location. 

Now for the lOOK game controller pots 
plus capacitor. The problem with this tech- 
nique is that you're giving up one-third of your 
potential resolution that way. The root of the 
problem is, of course, that 150K isn't a stan-

dard pot value. And the reason the Apple wants 
150K has to do with Murphy's laws, Ohm's 
laws, and, ultimately, quantum mechanics 
(which, eventually, would tell us why TTL 
wants 5 volts plus or minus .25 volts and why it 
goes to sleep or burns up if we deviate). 

But there is a better way to compensate 
than by using a capacitor. Instead, tie one end 
of a lOOK pot to +5. Tie the wiper to the 
PDL input, and tie the other end to ground 
through a 360K resistor. In other words, set it 
up as a voltage divider circuit. This makes the 
558 in the Apple think it's looking at a 150K 
pot. The problem is, most software that uses the 
analog inputs assumes that a lOOK plus ca- 



pacitor might be used and gives away that much 
resolution anyway. 

Now for something better. You can take a 
500K single-turn linear pot and fit it in one of 
those fancy model airplane joysticks. Tie one 
end to ground, the other to 5 volts, and the 
wiper to PDL. Since those fancy sticks move 
about 60 to 70 degrees, this arrangement is 
about right. All you have to do is get the pot 
shaft in the right position before you tighten 
the clamp that holds it to the joystick gimbal. 
This way you can make a pair of fancy sticks for 
half what they cost at the computer store. With 
the lOOK pot arrangement you can use a 330K 
resistor in series with a lOOK trimmer if you

want trim control over center. Most of the air- 
plane joysticks have trim levers built in. 
F. Kuechmann, Chicago, IL 

Jeff Mazur responds: 

To F. Kuechmann: Your first point on the 
change in IC part numbers is well taken. I used 
the numbers in the schematics to avoid 
confusion. 

As to your comment on lOOK pots having 
less resolution, I disagree. On a percentage 
basis, a lOOK and a 150K pot of the same con- 
struction will have the same resolution. This is 
determined only by the way the pot is built. On 
a purely resistance scale, the lOOK pot actually 
has more resolution. However, the Apple's 
game I/O hardware usually limits the resolu- 
tion to 256 points, and this applies equally well 
to a 150K pot or a lOOK pot plus capacitor. 
True, many games use their own software rou- 
tines to read the paddle and limit the resolution 
even further — but that's a different point. 
Regarding your scheme of adding the resistor, 
this will also do the trick. There will be some 
loss in linearity, however, at the high end, 
though with most games this will not be notice- 
able.

Computer Science Major Turns Entomologist 

As a computer science major in college, I've 
programmed on a few microcomputers (and 
two maihframes), and I consider the Apple II 
Plus the best of the micros. Softalk has really in- 
creased my enjoyment of the Apple and my 
knowledge of programming as well. Now there 
is a fly in the ointment — Dr. Jeppson has sold 
me on the Apple III! 

With all its features and sophistication I 
think it is the ultimate Apple. Now comes the 
dilemma. Apple Computer states that in emula- 
tion mode the III can run most Apple II pro- 
grams. Softalk's Marketalk Reviews states that 
many Apple II programs will run on the Apple 
III in emulation mode. Obviously there isn't 
an Apple II hidden inside the III, and all isn't 
perfect in Appledom. How can we tell, short of 
actually running the program, whether or not it 
will run on the III in emulation mode? An 
article on how the III emulates the II and the 
shortcomings of it would certainly help. I vote 
for more coverage of the Apple III — especially 
by Dr. Jeppson. His articles are fascinating.

A Glaring Solution 

Reading the January '83 Newspeak, I was 
somewhat surprised to learn that Rob Cook of 
Lucasfilm's computer graphics laboratory was 
having difficulty understanding the "plastic" 
look of generated images. The news item states 
that Cook usually found the spectral compo- 
nent to be the color of the material, not the 
color of the light source. Actually, the spectral 
glare of a shiny object is the color of the light as 
modified by the color of the object. This color 
modification is part of the very basic instruc- 
tion to theatrical lighting students. I am truly

Encounter with Exegesis 

I've been involved with newsletter and small- 
magazine publishing on a free-lance basis for 
some time. I have also done contract editing 
and technical writing for Silicon Valley firms, 
including Apple. I can take a somewhat profes- 
sional view when I look critically at other 
publications. 

I have a nit to pick, a general complaint, 
some comments on an earlier letter. The nit: 
Whoever decided to include a section for per- 
sonal, short, inexpensive ads made the gross 
error of comparing "classified" advertising with 
"display" advertising. To set the record straight, 
just because the ad is small, cheap, and grouped 
with other such ads without graphics or de- 
signs, it is not necessarily a classified ad. News- 
papers and magazines make quite a bit of 
money with this type of ad, and they are usual- 
ly set aside in their own section. 

However, classified ads are only a subset of 
this type. By definition, "classified" means that 
they are grouped into categories, or classifica- 
tions, such as software, hardware, printers, posi- 
tions available, and so forth. You will notice that 
Call—A.P.P.L.E. magazine skirts this by head- 
ing that page with the banner, "Un-classified." 
This is precisely what Softalk has: unclassified 
ads. 

Softalk could fix this by changing the title, 
or by actually sorting the ads and classifying 
them. Who knows, this might even make it look 
flashier. You may even find more people plac- 
ing such ads. It might even develop a "person- 
als" category. 

My general complaint concerns the month- 
ly drivel that emanates from Jonathan Miller's 
tripewriter. Apparently I am not alone in my 
distaste for articles that are ostensibly about the 
uses of word processing, but turn out to be the 
type of pap published in the Western Quasi Re- 
view and Mountain States Military Journalism 
Quarterly. Letter writer Art Cabot (December 
'82 Open Discussion) writes about the lack of 
substance in Miller's stories. Jonathan Miller 
has not replied, nor has there been a change in 
style since Cabot's letter. I wrote Softalk a let- 
ter previously addressing this very issue. You 
choose to continue to let Mrs. Miller's son 
milk Softalk for all he can get. Now I don't 
mind the new fiction you're publishing; it's la- 
beled as such and is a welcome change. All I ask 
is that authors state their purpose early in the 
article and stick to it. Get rid of rambling milk- 
ers like Miller. 

My last point is to respond to letter writer 
Bob Wiseman (November '82 Open Discus- 
sion). In all my experience both as a reader who 
compares notes with other readers of a large 
number of magazines and an intimate of the 
industry, I have rarely known someone who 
doesn't first open to the personal ads and then 
to the letters column. Look at the success of 
Forum magazine. Everybody likes to read other

Pokes 'n' Boots 

First, let me congratulate Mark Pelczarski on 
his approach to piracy. As a software author I 
am glad to see someone working so avidly 
against it. Nothing irks me more than to be 
shown someone's software "collection" con- 
taining my own work ill^ally obtained. Then 
again, these people never expect that the six- 
teen-year-old in front of them has written a 
game and has just insisted on the removal of it 
from their booty. 

My feeling is that only games should be pro- 
tected, and in the following manner the pro- 
gram should be on side one of the disk full of 
serial numbers. After purchase, the disk should 
be sent immediately to the publisher, who 
would then record the owner and serial num- 
bers and make a backup on side two of the 
disk. A pain? Sure, but a reasonable precau- 
tion. My work takes valuable time, and I feel a 
great loss of pride in my work and myself when 
I see my time stolen. 

Now, I'd like to respond to Mike Mahone, 
whose letter appeared in the January '83 Open 
Discussion (A Reset That Unsettles). Reset 
can be very touchy and the reference manual is 
a little confusing. I've been into machine lan- 
guage for two years and I still have to read 
pages 36 and 37 twice to understand them. 

I love toying with things; so at first I ig- 
nored those pages — too nebulous. I started on 
my own, but found that this often leads 
to disaster. I discovered that after booting a 
48K Apple II Plus the decimal locations 1010, 
101 1, and 1012 contain 191, 157, and 56 respec- 
tively. In machine language that's locations 
$3F2, 3F3, and 3F4 containing $BF, 9D, and 
38. Now I understand the BF and 9D. If you 
put those together you'll get $9DBF, the DOS 
rehook location. I didn't quite get the $38 
though. Being inquisitive, I changed it — what 
the hell. I poked 57 into location 1012 and hit 
reset. It rebooted, whereas poking 56 into loca- 
tion 1012 didn't change anything. This solved 
the first problem; if the first line in your Hello 
program were poke 1012,57, hitting reset would 
reboot the disk. Now for the second prob- 
lem: why? 

The answer seemed simple; the Apple needs 
1012 set to a special value. Well, I didn't stop 
there. I wanted reset to do something really 
neat. I decided that rerunning the Basic pro- 
gram would suffice. After research I found that 
$D566 was the equivalent to "run," so I tried 



the following program: 

10 POKE 1010,102: REM 102 = $66 
20 POKE 1011,213: REM 213 = $D5 

Much to my dismay, the Apple rebooted. I re- 
read pages 36 and 37 of the reference manual 
carefully and tried adding a third line to the 
above two: 

30 CALL 64367 

Voila! It worked — but wait. I never touched 
1012. Actually the Apple did it for me. Line 30 
called a routine that scanned 1010 and 101 1 and 
put an appropriate value in 1012. Problem 
solved. 

Steve Hawley, Murray Hill, NJ 



I've got an answer to Mike Mahone's unset- 
tling reset question in the January Open Dis- 
cussion, but first let me say something about the 
DOS Tool Kit, which I recently received as a 
gift. This is the best piece of software I have yet 
acquired, but its one fault is the documentation 
for the assembler-editor. The listings and expla- 
nations of the pseudo-operations are vague and 
hard to understand. I wish Apple would give ex- 
amples of pseudo-op usage along with a list of

memory locations ($3F2 through $3F4) in the 
system Monitor known as the reset vector, 
which controls what happens when the reset key 
is pressed. It jumps to the memory location in 
$3F2.$3F3 if the "power-up byte" at $3F4 is set 
correctly. There is a Monitor routine at $FB6F 
that gives the right value to this byte. Enter the 
Monitor and type: 

3F2: 69 FF 51 

If you make the 51 a 5A, reset will enter the 
Monitor. This is because $FF69 is the subrou- 
tine for entering the Monitor. When the 5A is a 
51, the "power-up byte" ($3F4) causes a re- 
boot. You can also use the reset key to call your 
own machine language programs if you set the 



reset vector correctly.

The solution to getting the Hello program to re- 
boot when hitting reset is simple. Just add the 
following line to the start of your Hello 
program: 

POKE 1011,0 

The following three pokes make the program 
rerun after reset is hit:

Whenever the Apple's reset is used, the Apple 
peeks into two memory locations to see wheth- 
er a cold or warm boot will take place. If the 
computer has just been turned on, it will per- 
form a cold boot that restarts the Apple from 
the beginning. In order to make the computer 
think it was just turned on, you can use poke 
1010.105 and poke 1011.255. These pokes at the 
beginning of your Hello program will cause the 
computer to reboot upon hitting reset. At the 
end of the Hello program, use poke 1010,191 
and poke 1011 ,157; then the reset will cause a 
warm boot.

In answer to Mike Mahone's question on how 
to reboot upon reset, use poke 1012,69 in the

To get the Apple to reboot from any Applesoft 
program, a poke 1012,0 will do the trick when 
reset is hit.

Vehko Lee Bekir, Bellerose Manor, NY 

All these responses lo Mike Mahone's di- 
lemma seem to work properly, but one thing still 
remains unsettling. Though the solutions all work, 
each one is different from the rest. Now let's see 
who'll be able to settle this seeming contra- 
diction. Anyone game? 

Deficient Disks Deduced 

In the November '82 Open Discussion there was a 
letter titled "Mystery of the Meddling Moni- 
tor." I had experienced this same problem over 
a year ago with disks that refused to boot. 
When I first purchased my Apple the disk 
drive was located to the right of the computer. 
Six months later I bought a second disk drive 
and located the drives on top of the computer 
with the NEC monitor on top of the drives. Up 
to that time I paid no attention to the brand of 
disks purchased. Now I do. I found that one 
particular brand of disk failed to boot with the 



46 



s o i: T A I 1^ 



MARCH 1983 



new arrangement of equipment. When the disk 
drives were removed from under the monitor, 
the disks would boot normally. It would ap- 
pear that the normal noise level on certain 
brands of disks is quite high; when additional 
noise from the monitor is picked up by the 
read/ write head of the disk drive, the sum of 
noise versus information is too high, thereby 
loading garbage. I now stick to well-known, 
brand-name disks. The no-boot problem has 
since vanished. As an additional precaution 
against future problems, my disk drives are 
stacked to the right of the computer. 
Mort Larsen, Winnipeg, Canada 

Frequency Factor Fathomed 

I believe the cause of the "meddling monitor" 
problem is a radio frequency field being gen- 
erated that causes the analog card in the disk 
drive to be interrupted. This problem can be 
corrected one of two ways. Set the monitor off 
to the side of the computer, or set the disk 
drives on the side of the computer and leave the 
monitor sitting on the console. This should 
eliminate the problem in the future. There are 
two monitors that seem to cause the most prob- 
lems, the Zenith green screen and the NEC 
green screen.

action from abroad in the October '82 Open 
Discussion. Ms. Obrock laments Apple's arbi- 
trary decision to end mail-order sales, and other 
readers seem to be equally disturbed by this 
move, although for different reasons. But I 
don't see the problem here. Ms. Obrock is both- 
ered because now she can't add on to her exist- 
ing system with Apple products. It seems to me 
that Apple has merely given an incentive to use 
other manufacturers' better and lower-priced 
products. For example, if one wants to upgrade 
a system to disk, Apple sells its drive with con- 
troller for around $550. A mail-order shopper 
can find a far better drive/controller package for 
between $350 and $450. Virtually any piece of 
hardware Apple sells is available through mail 
order from other manufacturers at lower prices, 
and most of them are better! For those who are 
upset because they don't yet have a system and 
now can't get those great mail-order prices, one 
of the largest Apple dealer chains in Houston 
sells the Apple II Plus for $84 less than I 
paid for mine a year ago. Be thankful; Apple's 
decision may have been a blessing in disguise. 

In regard to one of lo-reser Ralph Cinque's 
questions (October '82), the addresses for ma- 
nipulating graphic modes are listed on page 13 
of the Apple II Reference Manual, "Table 5: 
Screen Soft Switches." For example, to switch 
to the text page without destroying the lo-res 
page, simply type poke 49233,0. Although the 
screen will appear at this point exactly as it does 
after typing text, you should be able to return to 
the undamaged lo-res page by typing poke 
49232,0. These commands also give access to lo- 
res page 2. As to printing lo-res graphics, Mr. 
Cinque should refer to the November '82 Hard- 
talk column, which contains a brief review of 
the new Pkaso interface card, an absolute 
necessity to owners of the Prism 80. 

I'm startled by Tim Klein's answer to this 
question in December '82 Open Discussion. I'm 
not sure about his contention that lo-res page 1 
and the text page share the same memory loca- 
tion. To demonstrate what I propose, run Color 
Demosoft from the System Master and select 
either option 1 or 2. Once the saeen is loaded, 
hit control-C (reset will bomb the lo-res page). 
Now type poke 49233,0 (typing text will also 
bomb the image). The text mode appears to 
have destroyed the lo-res image. Now type poke 
49232,0. The undamaged graphic page should 
reappear. 

There is a much easier way to move blocks 
of memory than Tim Klein's byte-by-byte loop 
move. Moving lo-res page 1 to hi-res page 3 
(surprise, it's there) for safekeeping can be ac- 
complished by entering the Monitor (call— 151), 
and typing 6000 < 400.800M. Hi-res page 3 re- 
sides in memory range $6000 to $8000. Lo-res 
page 1 resides in range $400 to $800. The ma- 
chine-language command shown above moves 
(M) a block of memory (400.800) to (<) a mem- 
ory range beginning at $6000. For more infor- 
mation on this technique, and hi-res page 3, see 
Nibble magazine, vol. 3, no. 4. The article enti- 
tled "Apple's Hi-Res Page Three" should sur- 
prise you as much as it did me. 
Hal Scoggins, Lake Jackson, TX 



On tlie Move 

In the December '82 Open Discussion, Tim 
Klein discussed saving page one graphics by 
moving them to another area of memory. Im- 
proved speed can be achieved by using the 
Monitor Move routine as discussed in the Apple 
II Reference Manual, pages 44 through 46. Us- 
ing Tim's example, the procedure is first to type 
call -151 to enter the Monitor. Then, tyjje: 

(destination address) < (start address). (end 
address)M 

For example: 

1C00 < 400.7FFM 

This will move page one graphics up to $1C00 
(decimal 7168). To restore page one, type: 

400 < 1C00.1FFFM 

Of course, all this assumes that you haven't af- 
fected memory at $1C00 in the meantime. 
George Osner, Modesto, CA 

Picking and Choosing 

I am planning on buying a Pascal language sys- 
tem for my Apple II, and I was wondering if 
any fellow readers could give me a little advice. 
Which Pascal system could you recommend 
purchasing: Apple's Apple Pascal, SofTech's 
UCSD p-System, or another system aitirely? 

I would like to be able to write commercial 
software for the Apple II and other personal 
computers that would not require the Pascal 
operating system in themselves. I'd appreciate 
hearing about some readers' experiences in 
Open Discussion. 

Thomas D. Batson, Santa Rosa, CA 
Credit Where It's Due 

I noticed in the January '83 Open Discussion a 
letter from Ronald E. Jeffries (Viva Pascal!) 
crediting Edsger Dijkstra with the design of Pas- 
cal. A correction is in order because it was ac- 
tually Professor Niklaus Wirth of the Federal 
Institute of Technology of Zurich, Switzerland, 
who designed the language. Wirth did, how- 
ever, rely heavily on the structured program- 
ming concepts developed by Dijkstra and his 
colleagues O.J. Dahl and C.A.R. Hoare. (See 
Wirth's Algorithms + Data Structures = Pro- 
grams, Prentice-Hall, 1976.) 

On the other hand, I agree with Mr. Jef- 
fries's evaluation of Pascal as a powerful devel- 
opment language. I prefer it over Basic for 
problem-solving programs, especially with its 
recursion capabilities. (Can you imagine the 
amount of Basic code needed to solve the 
Knight's Tour problem?) 

Carrying this discussion of languages a lit- 
tle further, I recently read somewhere about 
comparing computer languages to spoken lan- 
guages. You really can't become fluent in a sec- 
ond spoken language until you can actually 
think in that language. The same applies to 
computer languages. To fully utilize the capa- 
bilities of a computer language you must be able 
to approach your programming problems with- 
in the framework of that language. A solution 
in one language may involve an entirely differ-

If yottr printer uses your Apple 
more than yott do, 
yott need The Bufferboatd. 



If your Apple is locked into the "PRINT" 
mode so much that you've taken up soli- 
taire to kill the boredom, you need a 
buffer And if your computer is the Apple 
II or III, the only buffer for you is The 
Bufferboard. Expandable to 64K of stor- 
age, The Bufferboard stores an instantane- 
ous bucketful of print data from your 
computer Then it feeds the data to your 
printer at its own printing rate. Your Apple 
is set free from driving your printer and is 
ready for more data from you. 



or expensive power supplies are needed 
because The Bufferboard fits right into 
your Apple — and docks onto your existing 
printer interface. The result is convenient 





Take your existing interface — 
and buffer it! 

Only The Bufferboard has a simple 
Interface-Docking System. No bulky boxes 



and economical buffering of most popu- 
lar printer interfaces, including the 
Grappler + ™ interface, Epson interface, 
and Apple printer interface. Thirty sec- 
onds and a single hook-up are all you need 
to end the printer waiting game forever. 

Up to 20 letter-size pages 
stored at a time. 

The Bufferboard comes standard with 
16K, and is expandable to 32K or 64K of 
buffering capacity with the addition of 




memory chips. This "bucket" will hold up 
to 20 pages of a print job, allowing you 
freedom to use your Apple. 

The Btt^erboard— designed 
excItisivelY for the Apple Computer. 

Specifications: 

• Versions for Grappler + interface, Epson 
interface, Apple interface, and other popu- 
lar printer interfaces • 16K buffer standard

Last Letter Lop-off Lamented 

I take pen to paper to suggest a new column in 
Softalk concerning Epson printers. There must 
be a fair number of Apple owners with these 
printers for Epson to rewrite their manual 
around the Apple. A column would seem to be 
a logical development.

can help me with. When I am printing a file to 
my Epson MX-80 that has been transferred by

A Thorn in the Side Dish 

I have an Apple II Plus with two disk drives and 
an Epson MX-80 printer. I also have a thorny 
programming problem that looks simple but 
has got me stumped. Here's the problem: 

At the next company group meeting, din- 
ner arrangements have to be made for fifteen to 
thirty-five couples, in settings of three to five 
couples, at five to ten different restaurants, for 
three to five evenings. I want to input the num- 
ber and names of the couples, the number of 
nights to be arranged, the number of restau- 
rants and name of each, and the number of 
couples at each setting. From this I want a 
printed output that shows, for each evening, the 
grouping of couples at each restaurant. Now for 
the clincher — I must be sure that no two cou- 
ples are seated together twice or go to the same 
restaurant twice. 

I certainly hope someone can help unravel 
this for me.

A This-Is-Not-a-Contest-Entry Contest 

This is not a contest entry — merely a set of anec- 
dotes, an alternative solution to a former con- 
test, and, possibly, the basis of a contest. I 
thought of claiming that this letter was com- 
posed entirely of subheads from former issues 
of Softalk but that is not the case. 

I am an assistant dean and coordinator of 
advisement at the State University of New York 
at Albany. The university recently decided that 
if our administrators had at least played with 



a computer once, then the gap that would short- 
ly exist between them and the students (and 
some of the faculty) would not be so hopelessly 
unbridgeable. Therefore, in December 1982 I 
took home for two weeks an Atari 800 (you'll 
pardon the expression), disk drive, Hitachi TV, 
and a book purporting to teach me Basic. I 
learned enough to know I wanted a computer, 
though I was unsure which one. 

On December 8, Bill Holstein, professor 
and former dean of our school of business, con- 
vinced me over lunch that an Apple II might be 
best suited to my needs and uses, which include 
entering (and sometimes winning, I might add) 
recreational math contests. Bill noted that he 
and his class had been working on the Signifi- 
cant Figure contest to no avail (October '82). 
Assuming you are used to puzzler mentality, 
you no doubt have correctly guessed that I im- 
mediately asked for a copy, even though the 
deadline for entry had long passed. 

The next day, I told Bill that G = T not T, 
since the cats were in sacks, and that C prob- 
ably is not equal to additive 12, but the sum of 
additive 12 through 1 = 364. Although I could 
not go further without knowing the height of an 
Apple II, it seemed to me the word "call" and 
other hints suggested ASCII codes might be in- 
volved. Rule number five suggested that the an- 
swer might be surmised without knowing any- 
thing about the mathematical value. Thus, "give 
us a call" may well be the correct answer. "The 
U.S. is significant in the microcomputer indus- 
try in general," and "Were it not for us, you 
probably wouldn't be doing this contest."

SOFTAI 1/ 



MARCH 1983 



Well, considering that a whiz like himself, 
and 500 or so students to boot, had not gotten 
very far on the problem. Bill thought this was 
kind of impressive for someone whose degrees 
are in Latin and ancient Greek, and who had 
never before touched a computer. He explained 
that my significance had to be correct and was 
an "in" reference to Steve Wozniak's Us Festi- 
val. Since I had not before heard of either phe- 
nomenon (Wozniak or Us), I accepted this in- 
dependent verification. 

A trip to a dealer with a pencil marked in 
quarter inches told me that x = 4.5 inches.

reached 11616125.1; my trusty old Sears 
twelve-digit calculator, 11616125.259. Bill inde- 
pendently found your .3 answer on his Apple II. 
But none of these seemed "significant." 

On December 13, I proudly showed Bill the 
"correct" solution: The clue to the whole thing 
was the title "The Significant Figure" and the 
many, many references to "significant" and 
"significance" throughout the column. The 
magnitude of the solution was solely deter- 
mined by raising x to the bih power {b = 12). As 
any freshman physics student on our campus 
can tell you, raising a measurement to the 
twelfth power produces an answer no more sig- 
nificant than the accuracy of that original meas- 
urement. Perhaps the Platonic ideal of an Ap- 
ple II is precisely 4.5 inches tall, no matter what 
the atmospheric pressure, distance from sea 
level, rate of motion, external temperature, in- 
ternal temperature, and so forth. However fan- 
tastic, precise, and minuscule the tolerances of 
microchips may be, I saw no reason to assume 
equivalent accuracy to the millimicron during 



assembly of the plastic cases. 

Therefore, assume a range of roughly plus 
or minus 1/64 inch variance. If x can range 
from 4.5 -I- 1/64 inch to 4.5 - 1/64 inch in 
height, then the value of A in terms of signifi- 
cant figures will range from 1 17 X 10' to 115 X 
10'. Thus, we simply discard the 10* as insig- 
nificant. 

PRINT CHR$(117);PRINT CHR$(115) 

yields us Q.E.D. Right? I guess not. Bill lent me 
the January '83 Softalk. I have this strong 
suspicion that without the benefit of a comput- 
er, and without having immersed my mind tem- 
porarily into computer-related solutions, I 
might have quickly translated the simplest sub- 
stitution code for Apple. As for .3 = II, I find 
this far-fetched and erroneous. Though "2" is 
indeed the third Arabic numeral, the third 
Roman numeral was (and still is) "III." (Had 
the Romans possessed the zero, we might all be 
speaking Lafin now, in which case I would 
probably have gotten my degrees in other dead, 
odd languages — English? Pascal?) 

In defense of my solution's superiority to 
the one given (Apple II), I cite the second tip. 
The existence of "us" {Softalk) has more to do 
with the probability of one's doing the contest 
than the existence of "Apple" (II or otherwise). 
As I have demonstrated, no knowledge or use 
of computers is necessary to solve the entire 
problem and arrive at the simplest crypto- 
graphic solution, "Apple." All computer-re- 
lated clues are accompanied by other clues suf- 
ficient to determine the values sought. There- 
fore, if one merely assumed that whatever a 
"two" was had to be measured in quarter 



inches, any decent code-breaker would need on- 
ly attack each of the values of A for x = 1 /4 
inch to, say, 12 1/4 inches. 

In sharp contrast, my solution requires that 
one know about ASCII codes and how to call 
them up (or at least look them up). Oh, I sup- 
pose you could argue that your contest page 
and the rest of your fine magazine has the Ap- 
ple as first cause. Aiiguments with Apples as first 
cause smack of biased arbitrament and, some- 
how, I never find them fully convincing. 

Therefore, had I known about the contest a 
month earlier and entered it, I would be writing 
this letter to express my feelings that I was 
robbed! Since this was not the case, I can only 
counter by posing the following problem. Ini- 
tially forbidding, it really isn't impossibly diffi- 
cult. Please explain the full significance of the 
following number. 

1 672328783287742776425953 1 87961 8795 

Tips: 

1 . Follow your own advice in the last para- 
graph of "The Significant Figure." 

2. Half the significance is more quickly 
found with a computer than without. 

3. The entire significance would be elimi- 
nated by a change or deletion of one or more 
digits. 

4. You would not be doing this problem had 
I not tried to do yours. 

5. Each of the preceding tips is probably a 
good deal more helpful than it appears. 

I checked the above number carefully, and 
those are the right digits in the right order. 
Good luck!

All's Fair In Love and Assembly Lan^ua^c 
Pro^ramminj^ on the Appk 

Buying a copy of Roger Wagner's Assembly Lines: The Book means never having to say 
you're sorry. 

Your programming friends will be pea-green with envy. They'll scratch their heads and ponder 
the beauty of your self-modifying code and indirect jumps. They'll beg to hear more about I/O 
routines, the stack, and sound generation. 

In short, you can lord it over your local programming enclave as long as someone else doesn't 
buy Wagner's book. Then you'll be in trouble. 

But at least you'll have a head start. You'll already have mastered branch offsets and reverse 
branches. Reading a game paddle, comparing commands, and carrying the flag will already be 
under your belt. 

Assembly Language: The Book costs $19.95, plus $1.50 postage and handling if you order 
direct from Softalk. Assembly Language: The Book is also available in many fine computer stores 
around the country. 

If you are attending the West Coast Computer Faire in San Francisco, March 18-20, drop 

by Softalk's booth. You can pick up a copy of Wagner's book and meet the folks who bring you 

the magazine you're holding. Also, look in the Faire program for the day and time of Softalk's 

awards ceremony. We'll be announcing the results of our Most Popular Software of 1982 Poll.

Bv ROE \L. mns III 



Scott Adams, president of Adventure International, is a rare gentle- 
man of the microcomputer industry. One never hears him knocking the 
competition or bemoaning the cleverness of another author. 

Adventure International was represented at the 1981 West Coast 
Computer Faire in San Francisco with a large booth in the center of the 
hall. A young company called On-Line Systems had a small booth off to 
the side. On-Line's Wizard and the Princess was just starting to make an 
impression on the market, while Scott Adams's text adventures were at 
the apex of their popularity. 

"Throughout the show, people were coming up and saying, 'Adven- 
tures, great!' " recalls Adams. "I would say, 'Well, you came to the right 
place,' but they would often counter with, 'No, we want graphic adven- 
tures.' So I sent them over to Roberta and Ken Williams at On-Line." 

Later, after the show, Roberta Williams came over to Adventure In- 
ternational's impressive booth and asked Adams, "Why are you sending 
all these people over to me? Aren't we supposed to be competitors?" He 
told her that as far as adventures are concerned, there can never be 
too many. 



"It's like paperback books," explains Adams. "We're all building the 
same audience. So they buy an On-Line adventure this time. After a 
while, they'll finish it and want another one." Maybe they'll try one of 
Adams's for a change. Two years ago that was a refreshing perspective, 
and, in these days of spreading corporate paranoia and ruthlessness in 
business, the microcomputer industry could benefit from a return to such 
values. 

On the Ball. Flying over Orlando, Florida, you're treated to an aerial 
view of one of the meccas of the computer worid. Shaped like a giant golf 
ball, a geodesic dome rises glistening in the tropic sun. No, it isn't the sil- 
ver dome of Disney's nearby Epcot Center, but the brown dome that is 
the headquarters of Adventure International. It's one of the most color- 
ful corporate headquarters in the country. 

Adventure International's history is the history of the husband-and- 
wife team that founded the company, Scott and Alexis Adams. Hus- 
band-and-wife teams so deeply involved in the operation of a company 
are rare in the computer industry; only a few other couples have been so 
successful. In each case, it was vision, ingenuity, drive, and practicality

that produced the spectacular successes. 

Scott Adams attended the Florida Institute of Technology in Mel- 
bourne, near Cape Canaveral. The only fully accredited college in the 
country that still has its founding president, the school is associated with 
Cape Canaveral and is predictably hi-tech-oriented. 

"I went to the college's computer center looking for a job," Adams 
recalls. "They said, 'Sure, what do you want to do?' I said, 'Well, any-

from Alexis. 

thing,' and they said, 'Good, we need someone to put shipping labels on 
the newsletter.' I said, 'Great, I'll take it.' " 

Three years later, Adams was getting free tuition in exchange for 
writing all the financial software for the school. Once he had a foot in the 
door, Adams took advantage of the situation to pursue his growing in- 
terest in computers. 

"My criteria for working for any company was that I would do what 
they wanted during salaried hours. After hours, I would have free use of 
the machine to do whatever I wanted. The thing I wanted to do after 
hours was to play games." 

After three years at school, Adams took a year off. He had been feel- 
ing a little burned out in school, and, when he saw a note on a bulletin 
board — "Math graduate apply for work in the South Atlantic" — he re- 
sfxjnded. The offer was from RCA. He admitted to not yet having his 
degree and to not even being a mathematician. He just wanted to go, and 
RCA immediately agreed. When the company told Adams the job was 
located on Ascension Island, he said, "Great, never heard of it." 

Adams worked for RCA on Ascension Island for eighteen months. 
Ascension is thirty-five square miles in size, eight hundred miles below 
the equator, and a thousand miles from nowhere. With the title "space 
optic identification analyst," Adams analyzed radar signatures of space- 
craft that the station was tracking. Done at the bidding of the Space De- 
fense Command branch of the military, Adams's routine was 90 percent 
boredom and 10 percent frenzy, like flying an out-of-control airplane. 
Adams spent the down time having fun with the station's huge Xerox 
computer. 

"I could do whatever I wanted on the computer almost all the time. 
The radar station is probably still playing one of my versions of Star 
Trek — run on the computer, but played on the radar sco|3e. 

"I learned more about programming working for the Florida Insti- 
tute of Technology and working for RCA than I ever did in any course." 

Circular Thinking. Scott Adams returned to college after his tour in 
the South Atlantic, and in 1976 he graduated with honors in computer 
science with a minor in business. RCA was right there with another al- 
luring opportunity for Adams; this time he went to the Caribbean island 
of Antigua for nine months. 



Cape Canaveral was the best RCA could muster after Antigua, and 
Adams soon moved on to DVA, a small software company in Mel- 
bourne, Florida, that specialized in handling the requirements of top 
government contracts. But the small-town atmosphere wasn't for him, so 
Adams found a place in Orlando with Stromberg-Carlson, making tele- 
phone digital switches. It was a new experience for Adams. 

"There must have been hundreds of programmers in a building the 
size of a large J. C. Penney's. There were desks as far as you could see. 
The company was releasing software every three months, and the pace 
was unbelievable." 

Adams's first microcomputer was a Sphere, which he bought in 1977. 
Sphere was the second company to market a micro, the first being MITS 
with the lengendary Altair. 

"I was their very first customer," Adams reflects. "The kit cost seven 
hundred and fifty dollars, with a tremendous 4K memory and almost a 
whole '/2 K of ROM built around a 6800 processor. It took some time to 
put the computer together and get it to work; the design was not the best 
in the world." 

Adams designed and built a graphics board, which he sold back to 
Sphere. He also wrote a tank warfare game for the machine, using hi-res 
bit-map graphics. Adams even had to design and build the game con- 
trollers — "Two levers with a button on top." At the time, Programma 
International was beginning to write software for the Sphere, and Adams 
submitted the tank warfare game to that company. But Programma had 
quit publishing for the Sphere almost as soon as it had begun. Adams 
sold his own Sphere in the spring of 1978 and, to no one's surprise, the 
company dissolved shortly thereafter. 

Adams replaced the Sphere with Radio Shack's TRS-80 Model I. He 
could do more programming on this computer and spend less time on 
maintenance. According to Adams, Tandy expected the Model I to be 
primarily a business machine; Scott Adams's software contributed to 
making it a personal computer. 

From Red Tape to Red Herrings. While at Stromberg-Carlson, 
Adams had discovered the original Adventure by Crowley and Woods. 
Like many of the adventure game pioneers, Scott Adams owes his roots 
to this great classic. In fact, Adams's first game, Adventureland, pays di- 
rect homage to Adventure in many of its sections. 




MARCH 1983 



SOFTAI 1/

Adventureland had its genesis amid hassles with bureauaatic red tape. 
Adams had been avidly playing Adventure for some time on the compa- 
ny's computer when it occurred to him to share the wonderful new game 
with friends. 

"I couldn't get them to see it at Stromberg-Carlson because they 
didn't have security badges. Well, I had my 16K Model I; so I thought it 
would be neat to write my ovra adventure. My friends laughed when I 
told them what I wanted to do. I didn't listen and wrote it anyway." 

It took Adams a week to solve Adventure on the mainframe, coming in 
every morning at six o'clock and playing intensely. It also took him a 
week to make an initial design for his "adventure interpreter." It took six 
months for Adams to refine everything. His friends stopped laughing. 

Adventureland almost never saw the light of day. Scott relates how 
Alexis, his wife and now vice-president of Adventure International, tried 
literally to bake the game. 

"Alexis was pregnant with our first child when I was writing Adven- 
tureland and she was becoming upset with me. I was spending all kinds of 
hours on the computer. I would come home from work, jump on the 
computer until midnight, then get up and work on the program from six 
to eight in the morning before I left for work. 

"One day she had finally had it. I came home to find that she had put 
all my disks — including my only copy of Adventureland — in the oven. I 
was not going to program anymore, she said, unless I spent some time 
with her. Luckily, Alexis had been so mad that she'd forgotten to turn 
the oven on!" 

And so it came to pass that Adventure International sold the first ad- 
venture game for the microcomputer. It was several months later that 
Microsoft released Adventure for the micro. 

The Tale of the Baggie in the Baby Buggy. In 1977, Adams had 
started what was probably the first American TRS-80 users club. The 
TRS-80 Beach Users Club still meets, although it's now in Cocoa Beach. 
It was at the club that Adams first showed the finished Adventureland. 
His friends at the club were duly impressed and suggested that he sell it. 
But in the summer of 1978 there was no place to sell the program. Com- 
puter stores, as such, barely existed. So Adams placed classified ads in 
several computer magazines. Adventure International was bom from 
those small ads. 

As soon as the game started selling, Adams formed his own compa- 
ny. In the beginning Adventure International consisted of Adams and a 
spare bedroom. He fondly recalls his first dealer order: "It was an order 
for thirty-five cassette tapes from Manny Garcia, who's still in business 
in Chicago. Manny was going to a special user group meeting, a sort of 
computer minishow, and he wanted to sell my game there. It took Alexis 
and me three nights to make the tapes! This was long before there was 
any packaging. We sent him tapes, typed labels, and photocopied in- 
struction sheets." 

The company's first real packaging required innovation. Adams 
realized that some form of packaging was necessary for retailers to dis- 
play his game, and he thought of using simple plastic bags. They turned 
out to be anything but simple. When he called bag manufacturers to get 
pricing on bags to fit the cassettes, the companies were helpful until they 
learned that the quantities Adams was looking for could be counted in 
tens rather than tens of thousands. 

Adams was not daunted. After a long search, he found the perfect 
package — a baby bottle's plastic liner. It was just the right shape and size 
and, because the plastic was much thicker than that of general-purpose 
plastic bags, fewer bags got torn. Adams sealed the package by stapling 
one of his business cards across the top. For mid-1979, that was state-of- 
the-art packaging, considering that most games were written in Basic and 
sold for the price of two for less than fifteen dollars. 

Behind Every Good Woman There's a Man. It was time for the new 
company to expand. In the process of building a new house, they de- 
cided to include an office. Ten feet by ten feet, the office sufficed for 
about a month — then it overflowed into the family room. When it 
threatened to creep upstairs, Alexis insisted that Scott move Adventure 
International out of the house. 

They took a storefront in a small strip mall because the price was rea- 
sonable; as it turned out, that choice led to a second business. Few com- 
puter stores existed in the area; so Adams opened a retail store in the 
storefront and tucked the software operation into a room in the back. In 



October 1979, the Scott Adams Computers retail chain was born. 

Meanwhile, Adams had continued working at Stromberg-Carlson. 
With a new house and its attendant new mortgage, a new baby, and rent 
on the new store, Adams quit the company. Linda Novak, Adventure 
International's first outside employee, then came onboard. 

Alexis Adams was the driving force behind a second adventure. "I 
wrote Adventureland as a labor of love," Scott explains. "Once we had 
sold a few copies at the club meeting, Alexis decided she wanted to do 
one. We worked together on Pirate Adventure, and there was no turning 
back. Alexis was the main writer of Mystery Fun House and Voodoo 
Castle r 

Scott describes a typical collaboration: "She would supply the ideas. 
She'd say, 'There's a cave,' and I'd say, 'What do you see in the cave?' 'A 
door,' she'd answer. 'Why can't we open the door?' 'There's a pit of 
crocodiles in front of the door.' 'How can we get past the crocodiles?' 
'Well, maybe the crocodiles are hungry.' 'Great, let's put some fish out in 
the ocean, and make it so that you can't swim, forcing you to find some 
way to get out in the ocean to catch the fish.' Thus the catching of the 
fish would lead to getting through the door into the cave." 

In the summer of 1979, the Adams adventures were translated to the 
Apple Computer. Creative Computing wanted to publish Apple versions 
of the adventures for their new software line. They lent Scott his first Ap- 
ple, so that he could provide an Apple version for them; until the recent 
dissolution of Creative's software facility, it continued to market some of 
Adams's products. Today, most of Adventure International's catalog is 
available for the Apple. 

One of the reasons for the proliferation of Adventure International's 
text adventures is the approach Adams took in designing the gaming sys- 
tem. The centerpiece of the system is the interpreter. 

"There is an interpreter at the base that translates the database for 
each adventure. So, when I write a new adventure, I only have to write a 
new database, not the whole system all over again. It isn't a hard-wired 
adventure. The databases contain the scenario for the adventure, while 
the interpreter understands the relationships between objects and rooms. 
I still write all my adventures on a TRS-80 Model I and then transfer

Last days at the old homestead. When Adventure International moves to 
larger headquarters, their distinctive geodesic dome will stay behind, split 
seams and all. 

them to other machines." 

The newest concept being worked on at Adventure International is 
that of developing a new adventuring program language. Similar in con- 
cept to Infocom's Muddle, this language is called Oil. Adams has even 
designed his own one-of-a-kind computer exclusively to operate it, and 
he's writing an emulator to translate programs to other computers. The 
new adventure structure will be called Odyssey. 

A Quartet of Successes. Adventure International has been and still is 
one of the most receptive publishing houses to budding authors. The 
very first outside program submitted to Adventure International, ac- 
cording to Adams, was from an unknown programmer in Oregon. 

"He said that he really liked my adventures and thought it would be 
really neat if we helpjed him get his product out into the market. Perhaps 
you've heard of him: Doug Carlston. The product, of course, was the 
Galactic Empire series. We still sell that series in our catalog today. The 
royalties he received from us helped Doug found Broderbund." 

In the spring of 1980, a man named Ken Williams called Adams and 
inquired about the West Coast distributor rights to Adventure Interna- 
tional's games. This brief venture proved highly profitable for WiUiams, 
but he was anxious to do his own programming. So, Williams sold the 
distributorship and founded what has mushroomed into Sierra On-line. 
The two fellows who bought the distributorship haven't suffered buyer's 
remorse; they're Bob Lefl!" and Dave Wagman. They've since built the 
business into the largest software distributorship in the industry; they call 
it Softsel. 

Pitting Pirate against Piracy. Those two jobs in the tropics heavily 
influenced Adams's writing. Several of his best adventures are set on 
tropical isles, involving pirates and buried treasures. Yet there is one kind 
of piracy that Adams has fought against for years. 

Each of Adventure International's programs has begun with the 
words: "The author has worked over a year on this program, so please 
don't copy or accept a pirated copy." Last year, when Adams reissued all 
twelve text adventures as hi-res-graphics adventures, he took the oppor- 
tunity to update his feelings graphically. Each of the games in the 
S.A.G.A. series begins with a short hi-res slide show conveying the eco- 
nomic hardship that pirating imposes on a software company. It's Scott 
Adams's "Open Letter to All Software Users." The first slide is of 
Adams himself The second picture is Scott's Adventure International's 
familiar pirate, who is in all the adventures. The rest of the brief show 
graphically explains the effect of software piracy. It closes with this plea: 



"Next time you're asked for a copy of a copyrighted program, please say, 
'Sorry, no!' " It's a sincere plea indeed; Adams's great respect for 
his customers appears on the only screen to precede the letter — the 
option to skip it altogether. 

In the S.A.G.A. series, Scott added more than graphics. He has given 
adventures a voice. Using the Votrax speech synthesizer, Adventure In- 
ternational's games now talk to the player. The games also recognize a 
lower-case adapter, include flip screens between text and graphics, and, 
for die-hard traditionalists, offer a text-only mode. Penguin's Graphics 
Magician, developed by Mark Pelczarski, brings to life the Adamses' 
rich, hi-res imaginations. 

A Call to Arms? Phone It In. Adventure International's Combat is 
the world's first two-player war game playable on microcomputers via 
modem. Recently released for the Apple, the game has some amazing 
breakthroughs in war gaming, such as small side screens that show what 
each troop sees. Each player can see only what his troops see. If the 
enemy is out of visual range, positions displayed on the master screen 
cannot be entirely trusted. Combat is played on a large grid, only a small 
part of which is seen at any one time. To increase the challenge, the game 
is played in a real-time format. If players just sit and carefully ponder 
their strategies, they'll be surrounded and annihilated. 

A brand-new division at Adventure International deals exclusively 
with business software. A retail-store cash-register program will be the 
first offering. Called C.R.I.S., for Cash Register Inventory System, the 
system was originally developed for use in the Scott Adams Computers 
retail stores. That aU divisions of Adventure International interact with 
each other is one of the main strengths of the organization. 

Adventure International's Computer Expo Division organizes local 
computer fairs. Responding to the interests of the rising wave of com- 
puter-related companies in the area, Adams has successfully produced a 
series of computer shows. 

It's hard to overlook the presence that Adventure International 
brings to computer shows; its large theme booths are always show-hall 
landmarks. Adams and company bring five thousand pieces of software 
to each major show — every product in the huge catalog. Customers can 
choose from a veritable wall of software and play or watch the games 
being played on any of many computers. 

Meanwhile, Back at the Dome. Alexis Adams works long hours 
guiding the path of the business. She oversees all facets, deftly adding her 
unique touch here and there. The result is a highly fluid and dynamic op- 
eration. The complexities of the business have grown considerably since 
she and Scott first began Adventure International. 

The staff has grown from two to forty, and the company now pub- 
lishes the programs of sixty authors. The whole catalog contains more 
than one hundred fifty programs, many available for several machines. 
The company also maintains an extensive mail order business. Every 
quarter, Adventure International mails out one hundred thousand cata- 
logs. All this Alexis coordinates while raising two daughters. The 
Adamses' third child is due in August. 

The retail division contributes more than monetary profits to the suc- 
cess of Adventure International. Alexis Adams feels that one of the rea- 
sons for the company's rapid growth has been "the contact that we con- 
tinually get from the people in the store. Most companies are totally out 
of touch with their customers — unless the customer complains. 

"I love working in the retail store, even these days. It gives me a 
chance to learn what people reaUy want, to find out what we can do to 
help the customers solve their problems. The immediate feedback has 
proven invaluable to our product development. 

"We have a network of several hundred local play-testers. When a 
new product is about to be released, these people are given copies to 
check thoroughly. They are one of the reasons our products are so well- 
known for being bug-free." 

From Emerson to Woodhead. . . . Scott Adams is a voracious read- 
er. Despite his heavy schedule, he usually reads a book a day fi-om his ex- 
tensive library. Science fiction accounts for 80 percent of the library's vol- 
umes; the remaining volumes are classics and mysteries. In Adams's of- 
fice are two large bookcases filled mostly with noncomputer-related 
books, including the collected works of Ralph Waldo Emerson and 
Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

□ The IBM COMPUTER SAT" 
r ] The Educator's Edition Package (n S395.00 ea. 



Adams also keeps an eye on new releases in the microcomputer in- 
dustry. His favorite game, apart from those of his own company? Adams 
exclaims, "I love Wizardry\ I took an Apple home for a week just to play 
the game." 

The Adamses' home reflects its owners' personalities. Completely de- 
signed and built by Scott and Alexis, the house resembles a modern me- 
dieval castle, complete with running moat and fixed drawbridge leading 
to the front door. The door is set in a three-story turret, from which the 
house extends like wings sweeping back in two sections. High on the wall 
above the front door are two stained-glass windows; one features a large 
dragon, the other a rose. The sun streaming through those windows pro- 
jects their images on the main floor of the house. Now, that is the ulti- 
mate in fantasy role-playing. 

Adventure International soon outgrew the space it shared with the 
retail operation. A small house sufficed then until corporate headquarters 
were moved to the geodesic dome. The three floors of the dome circle 
around a center stairway. With desks located along the curving walls, 
communications among employees are friendly and face to face. 

The top floor is furnished with an unbroken ring of computers. De- 
velopmental work, debugging, and play-testing keep dozens of machines 
running continuously. The noise from the games creates a polytonal 
symphony of sound. 

But the dome can hold no more. By summer, corporate headquar- 
ters will move into a new building in a nearby industrial park. The empty 
dome will welcome the overflow from the company's manufacturing and 
shipping facilities. 

Meanwhile, the retail store division isn't sitting still. Soon, there'll be 
three stores in the area, with four opening later in the year. 

It Was a Dark and Stormy Night. Not everything has gone smoothly 
at Adventure International. Scott relates the story of how he single-hand- 
edly destroyed half the company's computer equipment in an evening he 
calls "The Massacre at Adventure International Computer Center." 

It seems Adams hooked up a new Qume Sprint-5 printer to his TRS- 
80 Model II, and the printer began churning out garbage. He discon- 
nected the Qume and hooked up an Anadex 9501 instead. The Anadex 
began printing garbage also. To test the Anadex, Scott hooked it up to 
an Atari computer; the printer did not work at all. At this point, he con- 
nected a Centronics Quick printer to the Model II. You guessed it, 
nothing printed. 

In half an hour, Adams had unwittingly destroyed two computers 
and three printers. It was discovered, when all the smoke had cleared the 
next morning, that the Qume had been incorrectly plugged into the 
Model II's line filter. This burned out the Qume. The Qume retaliated by 
shorting the printer port on the Model II. When the Anadex was hooked 
up, it fried. The connecting of the Anadex to the Atari did in the Atari. 
Naturally, connecting the Centronics printer to the shorted-out Model II 
printer port was no more successful than trying the Anadex. The only 
computer left standing after the holocaust was the Apple. 

A Novel Future. Scott believes firmly in the future of computer 
novels. Among the first efforts in this field were Adventure Interna- 
tional's Interactive Fiction Novels, written by Marin Computer Center. 
Today, several companies are developing software that brings the user 
into the program as a participant. "Have you played any good books 
today?" may become a common phrase in the next ten years. Adams 
believes Adventure International is in the vanguard of that movement. 

"People are no longer scared of these machines," says Adams. 
"Many children are working with computers in some level of their 
s,chooling. I foresee that, in the next ten years, every house will have two 
cars, five televisions, and two computers. One of the computers will be an 
old one, bought in the mid-eighties and now relegated to the children's 
rooms. The other will be some real souped-up computer of the nineties 
that puts the world at the fingertips of the user. Our software will be run- 
ning on that machine." 

Given the accomplishments of Adventure International over its first 
five years, it's easy to see the Adamses and their organization remaining 
a major factor in the microcomputer industry through the nineties. 

Powerful dreamers shape the dreams of the world. For the Adams 
family, the future lights up at the flick of a switch.

A.t the rate we're going, 
we'll have these pages 
filled by 2083. And by 
2084, people will be 
clamoring for the next 
[nfocom creation. 

We hate to disappoint our 
public. So we keep you waiting. 
Because while the software facto- 
ries are cranking out arcade game 
after arcade game, pulpy adven- 
ture after trite fantasy, we're 
writing and rewriting, honing and 
perfecting. Before a single person 
enters one of Infocom's worlds, 
it must be crafted into a living, 
riveting, definitive experience. 



WE CAN! 

Judging from the public's reac- 
tion, it's worth the wait. For 
instance. Creative Computing 
welcomed DEADLINE™ as 
"thoroughly engrossing and real- 
istic," while a Softalk readers' 
poll recently voted ZORK™ I and 
ZORK II the most popular adven- 
tures of 1981. 

And now, for the moment, your 
wait is over. ZORK III, your final 



step in the underground 
trilogy, and STARCROSS,™ 
an exploration of a new 
dimension in science fiction, 
are ready for you. 

Look at them up there, 
the little worlds of Infocom. As 
our universe expands, compan- 
ions will come to help fill that vast 
expanse of white space. Till 
then, they'll continue to stand 
alone as the best of all possible 
worlds.

THE BASIC 



MARCH 1983 




o ution 

By Wm. V R. Smith 



Database management programs are a ma- 
jor component of today's computerized office. 
By replacing overflowing desk drawers, bulky 
filing cabinets, numerous phone lists, and "lit- 
tle black books," they can make information 
storage and retrieval flexible and quick. 

This month, and in the next two Basic So- 
lutions, we'll be designing and creating a sim- 
ple database program. Though ours will be 
limited to storing name, address, and phone 
number files, it will serve as an introduction to 



the principles of database management. You 
may find it will come in handy as a small-scale 
home database as well. 

Although we'll be presenting the program in 
three parts, it is constructed in a modular way, 
enabling you to use the functions of this 
month's part as soon as you finish keying them 
in. This section will allow you to enter and edit 
one folder containing a single name, address, 
and phone number. Next month we'U create the 
disk I/O routines. Then you'll be able to type in 



many folders, saving them to a text file on disk 
and getting them back any time you like. The 
third and final section of the program, coming 
two months from now, will contain the rou- 
tines necessary for printing out your list or vari- 
ous folders within it. 

There are two ways that data can be han- 
dled by a database program. One is RAM- 
based, meaning that all the data is loaded from 
disk at the beginning of a work session, manip- 
ulated within the computer's RAM memory, 
and saved back to disk at the end of the ses- 
sion. The other method, by default, is disk- 
based. This doesn't mean that the data never en- 
ters the computer's memory any more than 
RAM-based means that it is never saved to 
disk. Rather, the data is saved on disk one fold- 
er at a time, as it is entered. To read or edit a 
particular piece of data, the user calls it up and 
the computer takes just that data off the disk, 
manipulates it, and then puts it back. 

Both methods have their advantages. The 
RAM-based system is much faster in searching 
and sorting operations, or anything involving 
mass manipulation of data, because it doesn't 
have to go to the disk to get the data before it 
can deal with it. The size of the files it can deal 
with is limited, however, by the amount of 
memory available in the computer. With a 48K 
Apple — accounting for the amount of space 
taken up by DOS, the database program, and 
other sundry memory usage — this leaves you 
with maybe 25K for data. 

The disk-based system, on the other hand, is 
limited in memory only by the amount of space 
on the disk. If you use a whole disk for the data, 
you can get about 1 43K of memory in a single i 
database. A more sophisticated program could i 
potentially allow two disks for data storage, but i 
that would require a two-drive system and more (: 
overhead for indexing. 

For our database we'll use the disk storage 
method. This will slow down sorting but allow i 
much more data to be manipulated. Like al- 1 
most any programming decision, this is a trade- i 
off If you require greater speed and don't need 
to store as much data, it will be possible to con- 
vert the program to the other method. 

This month's part of the program is de- 
signed to store five fields or pieces of informa- 
tion. Because we'll be using random-access text 
files for storage, we have to decide right now 
what the maximum size field will be. It has to be 
long enough to be able to fit most circum- 
stances but short enough that it doesn't eat disk 
space unnecessarily. Forty characters is a good 
middle-ground figure for our purposes. Each 
field will have a name used as a prompt for in- 
put as well as a data identifier. The five field 
names (or headers) we'll use are name, address, 
city St zip, phone number, and misc. 

You can change the names or even the num- 
ber of headers used by changing the data in lines 
1210 through 1230. The 5 in 1210 is the number 
of headers and must equal the number of pieces 
of data in lines 1220 and 1230, which, of course, 
are the headers themselves. The only limitation

One Apple 
and %550 
can make a lot of pies. 

And charts. And grains. 



Introducing the New Personal 
Computer Plotter from 
Hewlett-Packard 

Now you can use your Apple® com- 
puter to generate your own presentation 
charts, graphs, and pie charts. How? 
Simply add on the new high 
quality, low cost HP 7470A 
Personal Computer 
Plotter. 

The 7470A helps you 
save time, save money, and, 
lets you communicate quickly, accu 
rately and effectively. 

The eye is faster. 

Data, when visualized graphically, becomes informa- 
tion fast. Charts and bar graphs can make any presenta- 
tion clearer and more readily understood. But asking your 
staff to produce the graphics 
for your next presentation 
doesn't ensure accuracy or 
artistic talent. And going to 
outside suppliers can be 
costly. Combined with your 
Apple® computer, the new 
HP 7470A plotter does the 
communicating for you. 
Quickly. Logically. And with 
off-the-shelf software. 

Fast and pretty. 

The 747 OA gives you high plotting speed with excellent 
line quality. . .faster than any competitive small plotter. 
On top of all that, it comes in an attractive design 
package that looks nice on your desk. And it does it 
for only $1,550. (U.S.A. domestic suggested retail price.) 





Count on it. 

The 7470A is built the Hewlett- 
Packard way. To last. Designed and 
engineered with only a few parts, none 
of which require adjustment. And with 
customized integrated circuits 
that ensure reliability. 

Pen Pals. 

The HP 7470A has 
two single -pen stables 
that output multi-color plots in 
your choice of ten coordinated colors. Pens 
are automatically capped and stored. 

An option you'll want, too. 

For only $95, you can also get a 17057 Overhead 
Transparency Kit that turns your plots into transpar- 
encies for overhead projectors. For "1 need it tomorrow 
at 9:00 A.M.'" meetings, it's a necessity. 

Start plotting your next presentation today. 
Clip and mail the coupon below. Now. 

Mail the coupon below and we'll send you — absolutely 
free — a sample plot, a more detailed brochure, and a 
sample overhead transparency. 

Then ... stop in at your nearest Hewlett-Packard 
Dealer. See the HP 7470A in action. Once you see it 
demonstrated you'll find a hundred ways to make your 
own Apple* pies. And charts. And graphs.

on changing the parameters of the program is 
that you have to make the decision before you 
store the first piece of information to disk. That 
gives you a month to think about it. 

Enter the program as it is listed here. The 
sections that come in the next two months will 
fill in the vacant line number regions at the end 
of the listing. You can run the program to test 
the sections already provided as soon as you 
type it in. Lines 2910 through 2930 prevent it 
from bombing out with an error message if you 
select an option that isn't implemented yet. 

Good luck with the program. Next month 
you'll be able to use it to save your data to disk, 
so stay tuned.

OF THUNDERCLOCK PLUS 7 




If you want to put 
your Apple® to work — around the 
clock — Thunderclock Plus is the solution. Just plug it 
in and your programs can read the month, date, day of 
week and time — down to the second — in any of Apple's 
languages. So your Apple can do any number of tasks 
for you automatically. In the office, the lab or at home. 

Most good software packages for business, data base 
management, communications and time management 
are made to read Thunderclock Plus. (It's compatible 
with DB Master,* Micro- Courier** and VisiDex^, to 
name a few). So no matter how you use your Apple now, 
Thunderclock Plus can make it a more versatile 
and efficient tool. 

For example, with business or communi- 
cations software, your Apple can auto- 
matically access a data base or send elec- 
tronic mail when the rates are lowest. 

In addition, Thunderclock Plus can 
organize your disk files. Our optional 
DOS-DATER™ software upgrades the 
regular DOS on your disks. So every 
time a program is saved or a file is modi- 
fied, the time and date, to the minute, 
are stored in the CATALOG with the file 
name. Now you can instantly know 
exactly when your files were last updated. 



Thunderclock Plus 
can even give you a sense of 
security. Or just make your life a little easier. With our 
X-10 interface option and a BSR X-10* Home Control 
System, your Apple can turn on your lights, water your 
lawn . . .whatever you desire, according to schedules you 
create. It comes with our menu-driven SCHEDULER 
software. So it's easy to design and modify schedules 
that can run in the "background" while you have 
"hands-on" use of your Apple. 

Thunderclock Plus comes with a one-year warranty. 
Powered by on-board batteries, it runs accurately for up 
to four years without battery replacement. 
So now that you've heard of Thunderclock Plus, isn't 

it time you put your Apple to work — 

around the clock? See your dealer 
for a demonstration or contact us.

About/ ^ 






LyDougCarlston 



Last month we designed a program that stores and retrieves address- 
es on disk using text files. This month we'll continue work on that pro- 
gram. In particular, we'll examine the print and editing routines and add 
a sorting capability. We will also take a close look at what we did last 
time and make some changes to improve the program. 

As you may remember, the general format of the program was like 
this: 

I. Subroutines 

A. Get input line 

B. Pause 

C. Write list to disk 

D. Read list from disk 
II. Main Menu 

III. Input Data 

IV. Print List 

V. Look/ Edit File 

A. Edit routine 

B. Delete a file 
VI. Sort File 

VII. Create New File 

We looked at sections I through III last time. Before we continue by 
examining section IV, let's review the first three parts. Look particularly 
carefully at the lines marked with arrows. These have been changed from 
the listing in last month's column. The reasons for the changes follow the 
listing:

We have really made only two changes. In lines 130 and 235 we've re- 
placed the # symbol with the % symbol as a substitute for the comma, 
since we had found ourselves using the # in addresses to indicate apart- 
ment numbers and the like. 

The second change is more complicated. Previously, when we wrote 



MARCH 1983 



U ) P T A L k

out the file to disk or read it in from disk, we simply dumped the entire 
array out, starting with the first record and writing the records out one at 
a time until reaching the last one. However, since our array can hold 200 
names and addresses, this system was not particularly efficient. It re- 
quired that all 200 names and addresses be written out to disk every time 
we wanted to quit, even if we had added only two names to our mailing 
list at that point. 

Since your author is an impatient, impetuous sort, he decided to 
speed up the process by testing each record as it was written to see if it 
was the last one in the file (by looking at the record's pointer to see if the 
word end appeared there). If so, the program immediately concluded 
that its work was done, closed up the file, and wandered down to Pad- 
dy's Pub for its evening pint. 

Trouble is, the word end sometimes appears at points other than the 
end of the file. For example, as we shall soon see, if an address is deleted 
from the list, the pointer for that record is reset to end so that the pro- 
gram knows it's okay to write a new address in that space if the occasion 
arises. The old program, thinking that end meant exactly that, would 
stop reading or writing, and half the mailing list could get lost. 

To remedy this problem, we've changed the read and write roufines 
so that they follow the pointers and read or write in the same order in 
which the list would be printed. Now, when we hit a pointer labeled end, 
we know we are truly at the end. 

This is another example of how fuzzy thinking can get one in trou- 
ble. Programming is jogging for the brain — and we weekend joggers 
sometimes overreach ourselves. 

Enough philosophizing. Let's move right on to secfion IV: Print List. 
For those who didn't memorize last month's column, section IV looked 
like this: 

2000 REM * 

2010 REM * PRINT LIST 

2020 REM 



2025 HOME : VTAB 5:P = 0:KT = 0: IF FILES = THEN 7000 

2026 PRINT "OUTPUT TO:": PRINT 

2030 PRINT TAB{ 8)"S(CREEN": PRINT : PRINT TAB( 8) 

"P(RINTER": PRINT : PRINT : PRINT TAB( 8);: GET A$: 
PRINT : IF A$ = "S" THEN 2050 

2040 IF A$ < > "P" THEN 2025 

2045 PRINT D$"PR#1":P = 1 

2050 K = 1 

2060 FOR Z = 1 TO 4:A$ = A$(Z,K) 

2065 PRINT A$: NEXT : IF A$(0,K) = "END" THEN 2100 

2070 K = VAL (A$(0,K)): PRINT : IF NOT P AND KT > 0 AND 

KT / 3 = INT (KT / 3) THEN GOSUB 90 
2080 KT = KT + 1: GOTO 2060 

2100 PRINT D$"PR#0": PRINT : IF NOT P THEN GOSUB 90 
2110 GOTO 500 

There are a few small changes in lines 2060 through 2080 that im- 
prove the format of the output. 

Let's examine this section. Line 2025 makes sure we have loaded a 
file into memory. Assuming that we have, the next three lines ask us 
whether we want the output to go to the screen or to a printer. If output 
is to be to a printer, then line 2045 turns the printer on and sets the vari- 
able P, used here as a printer flag, equal to one (the reason for this flag 
will be apparent in a moment). 

Lines 2050 through 2080 form a loop that prints the entire list, pull- 
ing each address out of the array by following the chain of pointers (K is 
set to point to the next address each time through the loop). 

KT is used as a counter to group the output into groups of three ad- 
dresses. Line 2070 checks the flag P to see whether or not output is di- 
rected to the screen. If it is, the program jumps to the pause subroutine 
after each group of three addresses. If it doesn't, they scroll by you so 
quickly that you can't read them at all. (We skip this routine when out- 
put is going to the printer in order to prevent the pause message from 
printing out after each set of three names.) When you're all done, line 
2100 turns off the printer and returns you to the main menu.

If you write a lot of letters, you may want to work on this section 
awhile to create an output format that will fit on labels. Preprinted la- 
bels are a wonderful way to give your personal correspondence that de- 
personalized touch. 

The next section is a combined search /edit routine. You can use it to 
look for a specific name and address and then edit or delete it if you like.

If all we want to do is look at the record, we return to the main menu. 
On the other hand, if we want to modify the record, it's time to continue 
to the edit section. Line 4225 sorts this out:

Line 4070 incorporates one of the oldest tricks in the book, but it is 
still one of the nicest things you can do with your computer. We have 
used it in this column several times before (most recently in January's 
So/talk). Using the MID$ statement, we can check each name in our 
mailing list against the string we input. Entering Fred will give us the ad- 
dress of every Fred we know. Entering Gold will give us Goldberg, 
Goldstein, Golden, and Goldilocks. 

If there is a match, line 4080 prints it out and asks us if this is the one 
we want. If it isn't, line 41(X) looks at the pointer and checks to see if there 
are still more names in the file. If not, it tells us so and returns to the 
main menu. If there are, line 4110 sets the new pointer value and once 
again loops back to the scan routine. 



The only complicated part of the edit routine is the delete portion. To 
understand how a record is deleted, you have to keep in mind how the 
pointers work: 



Record #:2 
A$(0,n) 
A$(1,n)

the middle name. In other words, these three names are hnked together 
through pointers indicating which record is the next one in the sequence. 
The pointers are stored in exactly the same manner as a line in the ad- 
dress. Names get assigned to a record when they are first entered. How- 
ever, the pointers are rearranged whenever the list is sorted (in this case 
alphabetically), which is why they often appear to be out of order. 

Now imagine that we want to delete David Smith from our file. To 
do this, we need to do two things. First, we need to change Don Jones's 
pointer so that it points to Tom Tom's address. In other words, we need 
to change the value of A$(0,n) from 4 to 3. We also need to change Da- 
vid Smith's pointer to read end, so that the program knows that his space 
in our file is now vacant and can be used for new addresses (it isn't nec- 
essary to zero out the record, since nothing is pointing to it and, there- 
fore, it will be ignored). Once we make these changes, the records should 
read:

Record #:2

A$(1,n) :Don Jones 



A$(0,K)

The next section of the program will sort our file either by last name 
or by zip code. There are many kinds of sorts; the one we are going to 
use, called a bubble sort, is by no means the fastest, but it has the advan- 
tage of being fairly easy to understand. 

A bubble sort works like this. Imagine that you have a list of ten 
numbers you want to put in numerical order. 

3824905617 

A bubble sorter pairs off the first two numbers and compares them: 
is 3 less than 8? If the answer is yes, they are in the correct order, and the 
sorter goes on to the next pair: is 8 less than 2? 

If the answer is no, as in this case, the sorter swaps the two numbers 
and turns on a flag: 

3284905617 flag 

It then continues with the next pair (8 and 4) and so on until it reaches 
the end of the list. 

At the end of the list, the routine checks to see if the flag has been 
turned on. If it has, it is turned off and the routine is repeated until it runs 
from the beginning of the list to the end without making a single swap 
(which means the flag stays off). The list is then sorted. 

The bubble sort can be used to sort things alphabetically as well as 
numerically. Your Apple knows that A is less than B and B is less than C. 
In fact, your Apple even knows that albatross comes before Albuquer- 
que. So let's take a look at the code for our sort:

IT'S A JUNGLE 
IN THERE. 




There's an untamedjungleinsideyourApple II, lurking 
behind the facade of familiar Applesoft Basic. A place 
populated by unfriendly natives lil<e carry flags, binary 
numbers, and indirect addressing modes. Where the 
only laws are the complex and mysterious ways of 
the 6502 microprocessor. 

For years Apple owners trying to learn 6502 machine 
language had a tough time in this jungle, forced to 
hack their way through one slippery new concept after 
another. 

Now there's an easier path through the machine lan- 
guage jungle. A path that anyone comfortable with 
Basic can follow. 

The Visible Computer: 6502 is a unique new program 
that teaches machine language programming. It com- 
bines a hi-res 6502 simulation with an extensive 
user manual/tutorial to provide the easiest way 
yet to come up to speed on machine language. 

The Visible Computer is like a microscope that lets 
you see inside a 6502 as it executes programs. 

You'll watch the registers change as instructions are 
performed. You'll see how instructions are executed ~ 
not just their results. You control how fast or 
slow TVC runs. And it can't crash, no matter what. 

Once you've earned your stripes as a machine lan- 
guage programmer, you can use TVC as a powerful 
debugging tool, with features veteran programmers 
appreciate, like: On-line 4 function calculator; 
single step and 6502 modes; disassembler; flexi- 
ble register and memory display. 

Requires 48K Apple II Plus with one drive:

6195 VTAB 20: CALL - 868; PRINT "SWITCHING "B$(0)" AND " 
B$(1) 

6200 X = XI: GOTO 6090 

Now let's examine this section closely. Line 6030 checks to make sure 
that we have identified our mailing list. Line 6040 permits us to select a 
last name or zip code as the appropriate sort field. (Our answer, Z for zip 
or L for last name, is stored in the string variable CHS, for choice. Line 
6050 then sets the flag to zero and loads X with the pointer in the first 
record.) Line 6090 checks to see if we are at the end of the list. If so, line 
6100 checks to see if the flag was tripped, in which case we'd go back and 
do it again, starting at line 6050. If it wasn't tripped, line 6110 would send 
us back to the main menu. 

If we aren't at the end of the list, we arrive at line 6120, which asks if 
we want to sort by zip code. If we do, it loads the zips from the fourth 
address fields of two records into the variables B$(0) and B$(l), and 
mails them to line 6160 for testing. However, if we want to sort by last 
name, we have to wade through that whole mess from line 6130 to line 
6150 first. These lines may look familiar — we did something similar sev- 
eral months ago. Line 6130 determines what part of A$(1,X) is the last 
name, and line 6140 figures out what part of A$(1,X1) is the last name. 
In order to make it more entertaining, we added a couple of instructions 
at the beginning of 6140 and 6150 to make the whole process visible (not 
really necessary, and it slows the whole thing down, but it's sort of cute). 

Once we've determined what the last names are, we load them into 
B$(0) and B$(l) and drop down to line 6160 for testing. If the names or 
zips are in the proper order, they will pass the test at line 6160 and skip 
down to line 6200. However, if they fail the test, they'll have to be 
switched. What this really means is that the pointers have to be switched 
so that X 1 comes before X. Line 6170 tries to determine which name has 
a pointer that points to X. When the line finds that name, control drops 
to line 6180, where the big switch is made. The name that once pointed to 
X now points to XI. X, which used to point to XI, now points to what- 
ever XI pointed to. And XI now points at X. Like this: 



Before: Y 
After: Y 



-> X 
-> XI 



> XI -> ? 

> X -> ? 



Line 6190 also handles the special situation when one of the items be- 
ing switched is the first item in the list (in which event your search for the 
unknown Y will fail). 

Line 6195 is included just to keep you informed. 

The final section of the program is used for creating new lists. Again, 
in order to work properly with the delete routine, a number of changes 
had to be made:

Left to right from the top: the information to be graphed is entered on the Data 
Editor. In order to ailow labels of more than eight characters, the labels for 
this set of pie charts are entered in two columns of the editor. 

The Pie Cliart program's format selection screen allows the user to set six 
parameters that will determine what data will be graphed and how the chart 
will finally appear. 

The Pie Charf program can only graph one column of data from the Data

user whose system can't display or print color charts. The slices of the pie 
are outlined in white and given a letter to tie them in with the labels in the key. 

The next chart shows a horizontal chart in color. Because the Apple only 
has five solid colors (not including black) to plot with, slices after the fifth 
one are done in black and white. Sorting the data by value beforehand ar- 
ranges for the five largest slices to be in color. 

The last chart shown is a black-and-white chart printed out. 



The pie chart is, by its nature, a democratic animal. A pie chart can 
be used to tell the shareholders of a billion-dollar corporation where their 
profits are coming from. A pie of the same size can tell you where your 
money is going. 

Pie charts have long been a tool reserved for the rich and powerful. 
With the advent of the personal computer, the balance is changing. Now 
anyone can create accurate, professional-looking pie charts without even 
being able to draw a good circle, much less figure out what portion of it 
represents nontaxable income. 

Instant Replay. If you're reading SoftGraph for the first time, go 
back and read the first two installments. You may find some interesting 
tidbits in this article, but you won't be able to use this month's pie chart 
program without having the programs that went before. 

Graphs require labels, and January's SoftGraph presented a shape 
table character set and a subroutine (listing 3 in that article) for putting 
the shapes in that table onto the hi-res screen. 

Last month we developed, among other things, a Data Editor for our 
graphing system. Instead of storing data in a variable array, the Data 
Editor pokes it directly into memory. This enables us to save our data 
more easily (using the bsave command) and ensures that the data won't 
go away when we load and run a new program. The Pie Chart program 
requires a special subroutine to read the data, however, and that subrou- 
tine is the one in lines 2500 through 2600 of the Data Editor. To avoid 
having to type the routine again, you can get it from the Data Editor and 
merge it with the hi-res print routine. 

If you're not familiar with the Renumber program on your DOS Sys- 
tem Master, this is a good time to get acquainted. What we want to do 
here is merge lines 2500 through 2600 of the Data Editor with listing 3 
(lines 9000 through 9190) from January. In addition to its enumerating 
talents. Renumber has the ability to merge two Applesoft programs. 

First, load the Data Editor. Isolate the read routine by deleting every- 
thing else. Type: 

DEL 10,2400 
DEL 2700,2750 
SAVE READ ROUTINE 

Now you're ready to use Renumber. Put the System Master in your 
disk drive and type run Renumber. When the fireworks are over, type 
&I0 to make sure it's in right. If everything is working properly, the 
screen should display: "Error— inaement = 0." If something else hap- 
pens, reboot and try again. 

With Renumber in, load the hi-res print routine. Remember, we want 
only lines 9000 through 9190, listing 3 from January. List the routine to 
make sure that only those lines are there, then type &H. List again. 
Don't worry when the routine seems to be missing; &H is Renumber' s 
hold command. The code is still in memory. Now type load Read Rou- 
tine to get the read routine back. Finally, type &M, Renumber' s merge 
command, to put the two routines together.

Renumber can also renumber programs, a very useful function. The 
curious may want to run Renumber Instructions to find out how this 
works; the indifferent may also want to do this, but with far less 
urgency. 

The Play by Play. The rest of the program can now be added to 
what we have. Let's type it in, one routine at a time. 

Among other things, the first part of the program dimensions some 
variables, sets some parameters, defines some functions, and reads the 
legends from the section of memory where the Data Editor puts them.

130 NEXT HF 

Line 30 will be of some interest to the trigonometrically inclined. FN 
X(C) and FN Y(C) are the functions used to determine points on the 
edge of a circle that has its center at XC,YC and a radius of RA. The var- 
iable C is the value of the point expressed in radians. 

The points determined by this function define a mathematically cor- 
rect circle, but when you run the program the circle displayed on your 
screen may look somewhat elliptical because every monitor is different. 
To get properly circular results, you'll have to make a little change in line 
30. If your circle is taller than it is wide, multiply the radius of FN Y(C) 
by .9, making the second statement in line 30 read def FN Y(C) = RA * 
.9 * COS(C) + YC. If the circle is wider than it is tall, however, make the 
same change to FN X(C) instead. You may have to experiment with the 
value of the multiplicand to get the best results on your monitor. Print- 
ers can also distort your graphics printouts; so if you plan to print out 
your charts, you may want to adjust the circle functions to suit your 
printer rather than your monitor. 

The next section sets up the input screen for your format options.

This section prints the parameter selection screen. There are six pa- 
rameters that determine what data is to be graphed and how the final 



graph will look. Each parameter has an automatic default. 

The Personal Pie. The first parameter determines how many col- 
umns to read as labels. The Data Editor only allows column widths of 
eight characters. If you want your pie charts to have longer labels, put 
the labels in the first two columns of the data screen and enter 2 for the 
value of this parameter. Then you can have labels as long as sixteen 
characters. 

The second parameter determines which column to graph. Pie charts 
are one-dimensional, so you can only graph one of the four data col- 
umns at a time. If you put legends at the tops of the columns, they will 
appear at the top of the parameter screen to remind you which columns 
you used for what. 

The third option determines whether, and how, you want the data 
sorted. Sorting it by value produces nice, orderly-looking pie charts. 
Sorting alphabetically by label may also be appealing. If you choose not 
to sort, the data will be charted and labeled in the order you entered it. 

The fourth choice is whether to create the chart in color or black and 
.white. If you have a color monitor, a color pie chart looks much nicer 
than a black-and-white one. If you have a black-and-white monitor, a 
color pie chart doesn't look like much at all. The same holds true for 
black-and-white or color printers. 

Style, for want of a better word, determines whether you want a chart 
plotted upright or on its side. If you plot it upright, it will appear on- 
screen with the pie on the left, the labels on the right, and the legend at 
the top. 

If you put a chart on its side, the pie will still be on the left and the la- 
bels on the right, but the labels will run from the bottom of the screen to 
the top and the legend will run up the left-hand side. This looks strange 
on the monitor and it probably isn't a good idea to put the monitor on its 
side to make it look right, but if you print the chart you can turn it up- 
right and get a chart with the labels on the bottom. 

Finally, rotation determines where on the circle the plotting starts. 
This option is included mostly for color charts, as some colors don't go 
well next to each other. Rotating the pie can sometimes alleviate the 
problem. Most of the time you can ignore this parameter. 

This routine allows you to select from among the six parameters and 
enter new values.

The vtab in line 300 is designed to place the pointer, a flashing ar- 
row, next to one of the six options printed in lines 200 through 250. The 
value of P determines which question is indicated. 

When you're running the program, you'll use the arrow keys to move 
the pointer from one question to another. Line 330 then erases the 
pointer. Lines 380 through 420 determine the new pointer location and 
go back to line 300, where a new pointer is printed. 

Lines 340 through 360 accept three other keys as commands. Con- 
trol-Q sends the program to the routine at line 2400, where it quits and 
goes to the Menu program. The space bar selects the parameter indi- 
cated by the flashing pointer and the program goes to the next routine to 
input a new value for that parameter. Control-P tells it to go ahead and 
process the chart. 

This is the routine that inputs the new value for the selected 
parameter. 

A flashing pointer, placed in line 300, indicates one of the six param- 
eters. To move the pointer around, use the arrow keys. Press the space 
bar to select a parameter to change. 

When you've selected a parameter, this next routine prompts you to

540 PRINT CHR$ (8);" ";: GOTO 450 

The input routine uses the get command. The routine is similar to the 
one we used in the Data Editor, although this one only allows four char- 
acters of input and ignores all characters except for the numbers and the 
minus sign (line 490). When you run the program, the reason for these 
limitations will become apparent. Pressing control-P will move you from 
parameter-setting to this next section.

In this routine the program makes sure the values of the parameters 
are legal. This is accomplished in lines 550 through 650. If the checker en- 
counters an illegal value it indicates that by means of a flashing pointer 
and returns you to the parameter-setting routine. 

The following section of the program reads and organizes the data 
that will be presented in the chart.

1260 PRINT : PRINT "FORMATTING CHART" 

Lines 660 through 750 read the labels in either the first data column 
or the first two columns, depending on how you set the first parameter. 
The read routine only reads up to the last nonspace character in a field. If 
you are reading two columns for labels, this routine adds spaces to the 
first field (lines 720 and 730) before concatenating it to the second. 

Lines 760 through 970 read the values in the column you have select- 
ed to graph. Line 790 calls the read routine, which returns a string vari- 
able. Line 800 uses VAL to convert the string to a numeric variable to be 
evaluated. If the values are found to be ungraphable (try to imagine 
graphing a negative number in a pie chart), the program warns you and 
continues. If it finds no graphable fields, it teUs you so and sends you 
back to the parameter screen. If it finds that some fields can be graphed 
and some can't, it asks whether you want to continue. 

Arranging the Data. Line 980 begins the sorting routine. If you tell it 
not to sort, it moves on. Otherwise it goes into the least efficient sorting 
routine ever conceived. Don't ever use this routine if you have to sort a 
lot of material. Given that we only have to sort eighteen fields here, the 
routine works just fine. 

The virtue of this routine is that it is easy to understand, as sort rou- 
tines go. Line 1020 selects the appropriate comparison statement, either 
line 1050 or 1070, depending on whether you told it to sort values or la- 
bels. The values are stored in a numerical array, VI , and the labels are 
stored in a string array, LIS. 

When the program sorts labels, it wants to put the list in alphabetical 
order. It looks for the string with the lowest ASCII value and puts this 
value first. This is how Applesoft interprets "if L1$(GF) < L1$(CF)" in 
line 1050. 

When the program sorts the list by values, it is looking for the field 
with the highest value — the biggest slice of the pie — to put first. 

The search loop (lines 1030 through 1080) finds the data element to 
put first on the list, whether that is the first label alphabetically or the 
greatest value numerically. Line 1090 copies the selected data element 
onto another list (the L$ and V arrays) and then sets the label in the LIS 
array to a high ASCII value, CHRS(95), and sets the value in the VI ar- 
ray to a low numerical value, zero, ensuring that neither of them will be 
selected again. 

The outer loop (lines 1010 through 1110) repeats this process until all 
the data has been copied from one list to the other in the correct order. 
At the same time it counts the total value of all the data into the vari- 
able TV. 

If the list was not sorted, lines 1130 through 1170 copy the list from 
the LIS and VI arrays to the L$ and V arrays in the original order, also

to determine which portion of the whole pie each slice represents. 

Lines 1230 through 1260 print some pertinent information that you 
aren't likely to see because the screen switches to graphics soon after- 
ward. These lines are included as a debugging tool. If the computer 
seems to be scrambling data, add 1255 stop to the program to find out

Once everything is read and sorted, lines 1270 through 2440 do the 
artual graphing. Line 1280 sets the values of D and F, flags for the hi-res 
print routine, based on whether you said you wanted the chart sideways 
or upright. The style parameter also determines which of two formatting 
routines the program uses. 

If the chart is to be upright, the labels will be printed beside it. Line 
1320 determines the radius based on the length of the longest label (LL). 
If the chart is to be on its side, the labels will be below it (that is, on the 
right on your screen, but at the bottom when you print the chart). The 
radius is determined in line 1360, based on the number of labels. The idea 
is to fill the space available by varying the size of the circle. 

Other considerations based on the style parameter are the location of 
the center of the circle (XC,YC), the rotation of the character shapes, 
and the location of the labels (XW,YW). 

After the format of the chart is determined, the program turns on hi- 
res page two, draws a box around the edges, draws a circle (lines 1410 
and 1420), and begins the actual graphing. 

The Plot Thickens. Lines 1440 through 1480 loop through the valid 
data fields, each of which becomes one slice of the pie. Line 1460 calls ei- 
ther the color slice routine or the black-and-white slice routine. Then 



lines 1500 and 1510 put the label on the top of the chart (whether the 
"top" happens to be the actual top of the screen or the side). Lines 1520 
through 1600 give you your options at this point, which are pretty self- 
explanatory. 

Lines 2400 through 2420 comprise a routine to return you to the 
Mem program covered last month. Running Menu replaces Pie Chart in 
memory; so you might want to replace this routine with a simple end 
statement until you have Pie Chart debugged and saved. 

This next section is the routine that is called to write labels. It deter- 
mines where the labels go and in what direction, depending on the style 



parameter.

Color Coordination. The color slice routine draws a slice of the pie in 
color by drawing lines of that color from the center to closely spaced 
points on the edge. Line 2970 draws lines around the slice in the white 
(hcolor is set to 3 or 7) that won't clash with the slice color. 

The color slice routine uses only five colors. If there are more than 
five elements of data, the rest of the slices are drawn by the black-and 
white slice routine. This is one reason you might want to sort the data by 
value, so that in a color chart the largest slices will be the ones in color. 

Of course, if you selected a black-and-white chart, the program will 
use this next routine to create all of the slices. The black-and-white slice 
routine is both simpler and quicker than the color slice routine. It merely 
draws the leading edge of each slice and puts an identifying letter in the 
center of the slice.

BRIDGE? 

Remember the bridge players in college? The ones who dropped their 
classes unofficially and spent their days in the student union scrutinizing 
pasteboards and calling out incomprehensible bids? Now think of your 
neighborhood hacker, the prodigy who is more turned on by control 
codes than by the opposite sex. See how much he has in common with 
bridge addicts — relatively high intelligence, for instance, a fascination 
with abstract things, a love of problem-solving for its own sake, and a 
willingness to live mostly in his head? That kid will spend hours reading 
symbols his parents can't decipher, occasionally cackling or emitting 
other nutty noises. 

By the way, those bridge addicts pored over pages of peculiar sym- 
bols, too — the only books they read in college (after conversion from 
Protestantism to bridge) were manuals on abstruse bidding methods, or 
exotic styles of trump coup. 

A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Goren. ... So these 
two sorts of people have lots in common (except that bridge players are 
generally social creatures, hackers usually not). Then what could be more 
logical than computer bridge games, or computer bridge tutors? And 
why don't we have more bridge programs, and better ones than sit be- 
side my disk drive at the moment? All that a bridge book can do, a com- 
puter teacher can do better and faster. 

Just make sure the computer teacher knows how to defend against a 
dam clever finesse after school.

Your Apple circumvents lots of little nuisances of bridge playing. It 
deals hands much faster than you can deal them manually — and its 
hands are truly random. You can save hands for later study or for com- 
parison with how your friends do in the same circumstances. In addi- 
tion, you never get stuck being short a fourth player. Nor a third, nor a 
second. 

The Apple's main advantage, though, is that it provides you the op- 
portunity to practice. Suppose you want to learn tactics for any of the 
dozens of bridge situations that crop up continually. For instance, when 
you have eight spades, including the ace, king, and jack, and your oppo- 
nents have five, including the queen and ten, how do you keep them to a 
minimum of tricks? A bridge book can only give you rules of thumb and 
a couple of printed illustrations. Your Apple can give you dozens or hun- 
dreds of real-life situations to try yourself against, situations that would 
take years to duplicate with manual dealing. Where a book can basically 
just tell you what happens when you try a particular approach, a com- 
puter can let you actually see repeatedly what happens. 

Suppose you're a relative novice who just needs practice trying to 
make bids in gamelike situations. You can't practice alone effectively be- 
cause you have to see your opponents' cards to play for them. But your 
computer can make a good opponent, as good at playing bridge as the 
person who writes the program. 

A Blackwood Bid to Programmers. Consider how inconvenient the 
books on bridge are, with their diagrams of hands, their pat examples, 
and their dense paragraphs of exposition. Then consider how splendidly 
they have sold over the years, even with their handicaps. It ought to in- 
spire someone to move into that limited but dependable market, starting 
with computer versions of classic books like Watson's The Play of the 
Hand and a popular bridge practice game like Auto Bridge. 

Unfortunately, three of the four bridge programs written for the Ap- 
ple don't take advantage of the possibilities of the computer. The pub- 
lisher of the fourth declined to have it reviewed for this article — or at all. 

The best of the three is probably the least ambitious: Bridge Partner. 
Boot the program and it immediately gives you several options — getting

ranges that you choose, setting up your own deal, or loading deals 
from disk. 

After you choose, the screen displays your hand and your partner's 
and asks you to name a contract. When you've done that, it plays against 
you as you try to make good. The big problem is that it doesn't play good 
defense — at a nickel a point, you should be so lucky as to get its 
opening leads. 

Still, you get to practice making your contracts — slams, games, or 
partials. You can replay them if you like; better yet, you can shuffle only 
the defensive hands and play again. 

Setting up your own deal can be intriguing if, say, you want to try 
again on a hand that got the best of you the night before. But the best 
strategy seems to be to try to make contracts with hands selected for the 
high-card points you choose — an hour, say, of trying to make partials, or 
half an afternoon practicing slams. 

A useful and entertaining program, but not a tough enough 
opponent. 

Down Three, Vulnerable. The more ambitious programs. Bridge Tu- 
tor and Bridge Tutor with Precision and Scientific Bidding, promise more 
than they deliver. They're sound enough in bridge theory and technique, 
but woeful as teaching devices. 

Instead of integrating dictum and example, theory and experience, 
the designer separated them on two disks. Volume one is essentially a 
long lecture divided into subjects. Volume two offers randomly gen- 
erated hands for practicing opening bids, responses, elemental plays, and 
others. Unfortunately, the precepts offered in volume one come too 
thick and fast for absorption and mostly without examples or any op- 
portunity to participate. Volume two lets you practice and lets you know 
whether you're right or wrong — but provides no reason as to why you're 
mistaken, nor any explanation of the correct play. This reticence can be 



annoying, especially when the program seems to be violating the guide- 
lines it set down. 

The version with precision and scientific bidding is identical to the 
basic version, except that it offers two extra files in each volume. But be- 
cause theory is so removed from experience and because the teaching 
seems so rule-oriented and unwilling to explain, most players will find 
this exposition of precision and scientific bidding too forbidding. 

The final disappointment: neither Bridge Tutor nor Bridge Tutor with 

^ V ^ 

Precision and Scientific Bidding includes an opportunity to play a com- 
plete hand. 

Looking for a Grand Slam. None of these three programs is easy to 
find. No one picked up Bridge Partner'?, contract when it feU victim to 
VisiCorp's layoff of all its game software a year or so ago; and the Bridge 
Tutor?, seem to have faded from sight along with Apple's Special Deliv- 
ery line of software, although theoretically they're still available through 
Apple. 

But even when they were new and eminently buyable, these pro- 
grams made few inroads into a market that seems ideal: bridge attracts 
people capable of monomaniacal passions, just as computers do; buffs 
are generally brighter and more affluent than average — the sort of peo- 
ple who buy personal computers; and the computer is spectacularly ca- 
pable of speaking to their needs. 

We'll be waiting, programmers. Dl

o r TA I 1/ 



MARCH 1983 




□ When Fortune publishes its next index to the 
five hundred largest companies in the nation, 
Apple Computer (Cupertino, CA) will be one of 
them. The upstart company with the unbusi- 
nesslike name took on the many times larger 
Tandy Corporation and barely flinched when 
mammoth International Business Machines de- 
cided to vie for its territory; it has now become 
the youngest company ever to join Fortune's 
elite. No one else has progressed so far in five 
years. 

Just wondering ... if the company had been 
called Jobs/Wozniak Computers, Inc., and the 
product we all know and love had come out as 
the JW-6500I, would we be writing this now? Of 
course, if the Steves had been the kind of peo- 
ple who'd choose such names, it's questionable 
whether the Apple would have been the com- 
puter it is. 

It's no news that Apple revealed the He and 
Lisa at its annual shareholders' meeting Jan- 
uary 19; what was less ballyhooed is that a real 
meeting took place, too. Therein it was re- 
vealed that Apple lis in users' hands now num- 
ber somewhere around seven hundred fifty 
thousand, that there are now nearly sixty mil- 
lion shares of Apple stock spread among nearly 
forty-four thousand people, and that Decem- 
ber's Apple sales of more than eighty-eight mil- 
lion dollars made Apple the first billion-dollar 
company in the field of personal computer 
products. That's extrapolating, of course; no 
calendar year's sales have reached the Big 
Billion yet. 

Apple's shareholders confirmed the current 
board of directors for another term; 99 percent 
of the 79.7 percent of shareholders voting rati- 
fied board members Steve Jobs, Mike Mark- 
kula, Peter Crisp, Philip Schlein, Henry Sin- 
gleton, and Arthur Rock. That's one heck of a 
vote of confidence. Even greater confidence fell 
to Arthur Young and Company, which re- 
ceived only a handful less than 100 percent of 
the vote in favor of its continuing as Apple's ac- 
countants. 

Shareholders also agreed to a three and a 
half million share increase in the stock avail- 
able to Apple's employees as stock options. 

Steve Jobs attributed the failure of the bill to 
allow tax breaks for computer donations to 
schools to Kansas's Senator Robert Dole, a 
member of the Senate Finance Committee — 
which is where the bill broke down after pass- 
ing handily in the House of Representatives. 
Former California governor Jerry Brown came 
to the rescue as best he could, however, with a 
state bill giving just such a break for donations 
to California schools. As a result, every ele- 
mentary and secondary school in the state of 
California will have an Apple lie, compliments 



of Apple. That's ten thousand schools. 

Apple's willing to do it for the rest of the 
country; naysayers prevent it often with the 
argument, "So what? They'll only do it to get 
the tax break." So what again. No company 
could give out so much product free of charge 
and survive without some break, and even if the 
company profited from the gifts — wouldn't the 
kids too? If you're for the bill, get behind it. 
Write to Dole, your congresspersons, the presi- 
dent, the dogcatcher — whoever you think might 
help in this cause. And if you're not for it, voice 
your opinion too — but for goodness sake find a 
better reason than holier-than-thou altruism. 

Perhaps the lightest note of the meeting was 
struck when an attendee wanted to know 
whether you could use directly all of Lisa's 
thirty-two bits instead of only sixteen, and, if 
not, when you'd be able to? Steve Jobs an- 
swered three times with increasing detail, but 
the questioner wouldn't be satisfied. Finally, 
Jobs set the issue at rest, quipping, "You can 
use the thirty-two-bit architecture right now, 
once you get inside the chip — as long as you're 
an electron." 

□ Tourists beware: it is against the law to 
bring an Apple look-alike computer into the 
country. The U.S. Customs Service is cracking 
down on the importation of the cheap Apple 
copies — coming primarily from Taiwan — seiz- 
ing fake Apples and software at points of entry 
all along the West Coast and in Honolulu. 

□ 3Com (Mountain View, CA) has signed a 
multimillion-dollar contract with Apple to pro- 
vide Ethernet local networking products for 
Apples. "When you add high-speed local com- 
munication between personal computers, you 
add an entirely new dimension to their capa- 
bilities," says 3Com president Bill Krause. The 
Apple user can share peripherals and a data- 
base of common information, as well as take 
advantage of personal electronic communica- 
tions facilities. Under the terms of the current 
agreement, Apple will immediately integrate 
Ethernet hardware and software products into 
its product offerings, including Lisa. Shipments 
from 3Com to Apple will continue through 
June 1986. 

□ E. Floyd Kvamme, formerly president of 
National Semiconductor's computer manufac- 
turing subsidiary, has been hired by Apple to fill 
the new post of vice president in charge of mar- 
keting and sales. The position was temporarily 
filled last year by Apple chief executive A. C. 
Markkula, Jr. 

□ Penguin Software (Geneva, IL) continues 
to blaze trails in redefining the term "user 
friendly." Having last year removed the copy 
protection from its graphics utilities, the plucky 
company is now cutting its game software 



prices. Effective March 1, all Penguin games 
will cost $19.95. 

"A lot of people are going to question our 
sanity again," says Penguin prexy Mark Pel- 
czarski. "We're going to try it for six months as 
an experiment, and if we're right we'll contin- 
ue." Penguin wants it known that this is a mar- 
keting decision and will not affect software de- 
velopment policies — they will still sell no game 
before its time. 

The company will not be able to make 
retroactive adjustments for dealers, distribu- 
tors, or consumers who bought a Penguin game 
for $30 or $35 at, say, midnight on February 28. 
Any purchasers who should find themselves in 
such a position are encouraged to look on the 
price change as a savings on future purchases. 
Dealers and distributors should contact Pen- 
guin at (312) 232-1984 about current inventory. 

□ CompuVision, creator of a computerized 
software demonstration system for retailers, has 
relocated to a new facility, doubling its office 
space. Formerly of San Jose, the company's 
West Coast sales and customer service depart- 
ments are now at 3140 De La Cruz Boulevard, 
Suite 101, Santa Clara, CA 95050. Two region- 
al customer service representatives serving the 
northern California and New York areas have 
been added, and two more are planned for Dal- 
las and Chicago. The CompuVision system 
works like a jukebox of videotaped presenta- 
tions on selected software programs, and con- 
sists of a nineteen-inch color monitor, video 
player, and custom-designed interface system 
housed in a floor-standing system. 

□ Epyx/ Automated Simulations (Sunnyvale, 
CA) has elected its board of directors. Sam 
Bernstein is an independent marketing consult- 
ant in Cupertino, California; Joseph Horowitz 
is a venture capital investor and associate at 
U.S. Ventures in Menlo Park, California; and 
William P. Lanphear IV is a venture capital in- 
vestor and partner in the Early Stages partner- 
ship of San Francisco. In his address to share- 
holders, president James Connelley an- 
nounced that the sales rate of Epyx strategy 
games for fiscal 1982 was "three times that of 
the previous year, and is forecast to grow by a 
factor of five by the end of fiscal 1983." 

□ The latest companies to enter into distribu- 
tion agreements with Softsel (Inglewood, CA) 
are PromptDoc (Colorado Springs, CO) and 
Innovative Computer Products (Tarzana, CA). 
The Inglewood distributor will carry the 
PromptDoc Manual Maker, an aid to docu- 
mentation writing, and Innovative's line of Per- 
fectData computer care products. 

□ Spinnaker Software (Cambridge, MA), a 
publisher of educational game programs, has 
completed second-round financing of $1.5 mil-

lion with four investment firms: New Enter- 
prise Associates of San Francisco, Harvard 
Management of Boston, Alex Brown and Sons 
of Baltimore, and L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, 
Towbin of New York. Chairman William Bow- 
man reported that the company took orders for 
forty-five thousand copies of its first four edu- 
cational games between September 1 and De- 
cember 10 of last year, exceeding its forecast fig- 
ures by 400 percent. 

□ Software Dimensions (Citrus Heights, CA) 
has expanded its distribution network. Soft- 
ware Distributors and Micro D will act as na- 
tional distributors; CompuServe will cover the 
Western Canada region; and Zainax Systems 
will serve the mid-Atlantic. Internationally, 
Arabian Computer serves Saudi Arabia and the 
Middle East, and Mediatech distributes to the 
United Kingdom. The company has intro- 
duced new packaging for its line of accounting 
software and has rewritten all documentation to 
improve ease of use. It has also developed a 
training program for retailers, consisting of a 
videotape, a training manual, a quarterly news- 
letter, and a toll-free support line: (800) 824- 
1212; in CaHfornia, (800) 822-3303. 

□ You've heard, no doubt, about the com- 
puter revolution. If you're like most people in 
the world, you ask: How much of this "revolu- 
tion" is genuine, positive social change and how 
much is pure hype? What are the goals of this 
revolution — the Fortune 500 or the betterment 
of humankind? 

What would Orwell say if he were alive to- 
day? You'll hear that question a lot in the next 
two years. Are personal computers spreading 
totalitarianism? Or are they the key to ending 
tyranny forever? 

It all comes down to who is using a 
computer for what purpose. 

On January 15, the overwhelmingly posi- 
tive aspects of the computer revolution were 
demonstrated in a group home for the educa- 
tionally retarded in Palo Alto, California. More 
than half a dozen employees of Silicon Valley 
Systems donated their time, software, and com- 



puters to the admirable task of introducing the 
technology to some of those less fortunate than 
most of us. 

Silicon Valley's president, Nathan Schul- 
hof, personally took charge of making the ar- 
rangements with Joe Eller, director of the Palo 
Alto group home. Six young people live in the 
home learning basic survival skills that, Eller 
says, "most of us have assimilated in the course 
of growing up and take for granted." 

While the Silicon Valley folks set up several 
Apples and an Atari, a mime known as Rain- 
bow (the one in Silicon Valley's Word Handler 
advertisements) entertained the residents of the 
home. He was a big hit and almost upstaged the 
true stars of the day. But when the computers 
were up and running the enthusiastic young 
adults took to them with vigor. 

Silicon Valley employees demonstrated a 
variety of software that included educational 
programs, games, and word processing. The 
games got the best reponse; the bright smiles 
and laughter in the house were evidence that the 
affair was a success. 

The presentation was short, but its legacy 
will live on. Silicon Valley donated a computer 
to the group home, as well as a number of soft- 
ware packages. They believed the group home 
residents could benefit from the incorporation 
of microcomputers into the learning process. 
Although it's not an academic situation, the 
group home emphasizes independent living 
skills and self-sufficiency. Personal computers, 
on a one-to-one basis with an educationally 
handicapped person, are well-suited to these 
kinds of goals. 

Silicon Valley Systems plans to make these 
presentations once a month to similar groups 
that wouldn't normally have the opportunity, 
usually for economic reasons, for contact with 
computer technology. In February, the com- 
pany visited the Children's Hospital at Stan- 
ford University. 

So, amid all those integrated circuits and in- 
dustrial parks that are evident throughout Sili- 
con Valley, there is a heart. Rather than spread- 



ing tyranny and enslaving the masses, the com- 
puter revolution is opening doors. What's on 
the other side is what we all want it to be. The 
future that is ours is that of the residents of Joe 
Eller's group home as well. 

We are all equal in the eyes of the com- 
puter. 

□ Jim Harris, former marketing manager of 
Intel's software distribution and support opera- 
tions, has been appointed general manager of 
the OEM group at Microsoft (Bellevue, WA). 
He will be responsible for the management and 
direction of the domestic OEM organization, its 
language offerings, operating systems, and pro- 
ductivity software. 

□ Fourteen distributors have been signed to 
carry the educational game programs produced 
by the Learning Company (Portola Valley, 
CA). Micro D and Softsel are their major com- 
mercial American distributors, with Bell & 
Howell largely serving the educational market. 
Others are Software Distribution Services, East- 
em Software Distributors, Micro Distributors, 
First Software, Mobilsoft, Soft Center Distrib- 
utors, and Hayloft Distributing. 

□ WIDL Video (Chicago, IL) has filed suit 
against Advanced Software Technology (Kan-

□ Mind Games (Beverly Hills, CA) is the lat- 
est game software house to appear on the scene. 
Founded by Greg Segall and Gil Beyda, the 
company has debuted with The Desecration, the 
first of a planned line of "Adventurecade" 
games, in which several arcade game sequences 
are integrated into the plot of a graphic 
adventure. 

□ Don Williams, former sales support man- 
ager for Apple Computer and author of Desk- 
top Plan, has cofounded Desktop Computer 
Software (Santa Cruz, CA) with his son, Mi- 
chael. In announcing the new company, Wil- 
liams stated that his intent was to "establish a 
publishing house geared toward the independ- 
ent author and low-cost 'commodity' soft- 
ware programs in the decision-support area. As 
the author of the first financial modeling pro- 
gram for microcomputers, I've seen the micro 
software industry come out of nowhere and be- 
come a several-hundred-million-dollar busi- 
ness. In the race to secure early market share 
and control of distribution, many of the origi- 
nal software publishers have turned away from 
the independent author. Instead, these publish- 
ers have turned to in-house development. Yet, 
without those early software development en- 
trepreneurs and their innovative products like 
VisiCalc, none of these publishers would likely 
exist today." 

Williams, after managing IBM's senior 
executive computer education program, wrote 
Desktop Plan as director of dealer development 
at PolyMorphic Systems in September 1978, 



turning it over to VisiCorp when he joined Ap- 
ple. His goal is to produce a new generation of 
executive software products that emulate user 
thought processes and can be learned by the 
novice user in a few minutes. 
D Ultra Magnetics (Watsonville, CA), manu- 
facturer of flexible disks, has appointed Jim 
Brashers director of quality assurance. He was 
formerly with Pragma Data Systems as man- 
ager of quality activities and was previously in- 
volved in quality control for Amdahl, Verba- 
tim, and Memorex. 

□ Speaking of which: Verbatim (Sunnyvale, 
CA) has announced the promotion of three 
executives to the level of senior vice president. 
Hal Acuff is senior vice president, software, and 
president of Da kin 5, Verbatim's software sub- 
sidiary in Denver. Dr. Geoffrey Bate has been 
named senior vice president of research and de- 
velopment, and Marshall Hart is now senior 
vice president, quality. 

Q CompuShop (Richardson, TX), a national 
computer retail chain, has gained three cor- 
porate officers. Company controller Nancy 
Ross is now also vice president, as are manager 
of operations Charles Huff and director of mer- 
chandising Joe Harmon. President Jim Shuster 
expressed confidence in the management team 
in implementing CompuShop's expansion 
plans, which call for thirty-six stores open by 
October 1983. 

D VisiCorp (San Jose, CA) has added three 
people to its marketing division. (No one does 
anything by twos anymore.) David Spencer, 
late of Clorox, is director of marketing com- 
munications. A. W. Pirtle, director of market- 
ing for large accounts such as IBM, Apple, 
Tandy, and DEC, brings data processing sales 
management experience from ITT Courier, 
where he was vice president of marketing for in- 
ternational product support. Peter Schireson, 
sales education manager, is in charge of 
VisiCorp's education and training programs.

In the beginning, the Apple II was considered primarily a game com- 
puter. In fact, that's what Steve Wozniak intended it to be. 

But Wozniak chewed more than he bit off, and the result was a ma- 
chine that suited the needs of business, education, science — -just about 
everyone found a good use for the Apple. 

Given its purpose in the beginning and given the fact that that begin- 
ning took place nearly six years ago, the Apple was way above every- 
thing else available at the time. Even its keyboard was the best avail- 
able — far superior to the Pet with its calculatorlike keys and the TRS-80 
with its barely debounced console. 

Now that the Apple II, mostly in its Plus configuration, has proven 
itself a popular and capable business machine, its keyboard is a major 
shortcoming. After all, built-in lower-case capability is almost a must for 
word processing, and financial work cries out for the convenience of a 
numeric keypad. No Apple II prior to the He — meaning almost all the 
Apples already in circulation — has had either, and even the He lacks the 
keypad, although it does have a port for an outside one. But, in the same 
spirit that has produced more than 90 percent of all Apple-related prod- 
ucts, third-party manufacturers have come to the rescue. 

Before we look at the new hardware that has become available, a 
brief history of the Apple keyboard is in order. In the beginning, there 
was that "really nice keyboard" — the one with the power light that 
looked like one of the keys. (Can anyone honestly deny thinking that it 
was also the power switch at first?) This keyboard went through several 
phases, but, generally speaking, it was a single board unit that attached 
directly to the motherboard via a short ribbon cable. 

One annoying problem with the old keyboard in its various incarna- 
tions was its lack of a true N-key rollover. Rollover is the ability of a key- 
board to recognize a keypress even if one or more keys hit previously are 
still being held down. Rollover is especially important if you're a fast 
typist, since you may strike the next key before fully releasing the pre- 
vious one. Thus, with a true N-key (or infinite) rollover keyboard, press- 
ing and holding down the keys A, B, and C in order produces the same 
results as if each key had been struck and released individually. 

The old keyboard had such rollover but it was often limited to two 
keys, depending on the specific characters pressed. Thus, pressing more 
than two keys in too close a succession had the potential of giving false 
results. This same kind of thing may occur when you type run. If you 
haven't released the R key by the time you press the N key, you may get 
runh. The extra B is a result of the R, U, and N keys being pressed si- 
multaneously. Since run is a common command, even hunt-and-p»eck 
typists can find themselves typing this too quickly (those who use more 
than two fingers, that is). 

Although the older keyboards have not been used on Apples for sev- 
eral years, the keyboard description and schematic contained on pages 
100 through 102 of the Apple II Reference Manual refer to the old 
boards. Even the latest revision of the addendum to the reference man- 
ual makes no mention of the changes made to the keyboard. 

In 1980, however, during the Revision 6 motherboards, Apple Com- 
puter introduced the new-style keyboard with a separate piggyback key- 
board encoder board. The major reason for the change was that the spe- 
cial keyboard encoder IC used by the old keyboards was no longer be- 
ing manufactured. By now, the power light had become a square piece of 
plastic fiush with the case, and a spring had been added to the reset key 
so it would be a little harder to press it accidentally. 



The new encoder board now had provisions for requiring a control- 
reset operation. And, with a simple modification, the shift keys could be 
made to function (more on this later). Although missing the connector, 
this board was also designed to accept an external numeric keypad. 

The current Apple II Plus keyboards still use this same encoder. The 
styling of the keys has changed a little. They now have a "sculptured" 
shape that not everyone considers an improvement. One advantage is 
that the keys are not as shiny as the old ones, which means that there is 
less glare in a harshly lit room. The new keyboard still has only two-key 
rollover, but the switch matrix is different. As a result, quick typing of of- 
ten-used commands such as run and list (and most other common com- 
binations of keystrokes) doesn't generate any extraneous characters. 

To rival the state-of-the-art keyboards, several enhancements need to 
be made to the Apple keyboard. For starters, the keyboard must allow 
the entry of lower-case letters by means of functioning shift keys. Some 
form of a shift-lock should also be provided. It would also be nice to re- 
gain the missing ASCII characters such as the curly brackets and the 
square brackets. Since there aren't any extra keys on the Apple, this will 
probably have to be accomplished using various combinations of the 
shift and control keys. A ten-key or full financial keypad to facilitate fast 
numeric entry would also be a nice improvement. Of course, it would 
have to be external. 

With all these enhancements, we might also want a FIFO (First-In- 
First-Out) keyboard buffer to allow keyboard input even when the com- 
puter is busy (for example, when it is accessing a disk). Finally, there are 
times when it might be desirable to redefine certain keys or allow one 
keystroke to represent an entire string of characters (that is, to create a 
keyboard macro). All of these things are possible with the products we're 
going to talk about now. 

Shift Key Modification. The simplest way to gain lower-case entry 
capability for the newer keyboards is through the encoder board itself. 
Just to the right of the reset control switch are several holes. If a switch is 
mounted here, the shift keys can be made to function normally. (Shift 
key modification gives you lower-case entry capability only. If you want 
to display lower case on the screen, some form of lower-case adapter or 
eighty-column board will, of course, be needed.) 

To add the switch, start by removing the encoder board from the 
keyboard. This is accomplished with the aid of a small pair of pliers to 
free the plastic spacers holding the boards together. By squeezing the tips 
of each spacer, you can gently rock the encoder board back and forth 
until it is free. 

After removing the encoder, examine the area where the switch will 
be mounted. There will probably be an outline of the switch and the des- 
ignation S2. Note that there are two shorting pads (those bow-tie-shaped 
traces) in this area. These must be cut with a razor or sharp knife. Then 
add a DPDT (double pole, double throw) switch (C & K type 7201 is 
perfect), soldering to the existing holes. Check your work and then re- 
place the encoder board back under the keyboard. 

The added switch now selects one of two modes. When the switch is 
toward the left, the Apple keyboard operates as before; this is also the 
shift-lock mode. Moving the switch to the right puts the keyboard in the 
lower-case mode and enables the shift keys. This mode can be used for 
word processing, for telecommunications, or for when you're working in 
Pascal or CP/M. Since Apple's Basic and DOS don't recognize lower- j 
case commands, however, the lack of an external shift-lock key be-

comes rather cumbersome. 

Repeaterrrr. The Repeaterrrr is an auto-repeat adapter from High 
Order Micro Electronics. It's easy to install this device on any Revision 6 
or above Apple that has the separate encoder board under the key- 
board. The Repeaterrrr has an adjustable delay and also uses the Ap- 
ple's repeat key to double the repeat rate. Furthermore, this board offers 
a convenient place to attach the common "one-wire" shift key modifica- 
tion without the need for soldering. 

Installation of the Repeaterrrr requires removal of the encoder 
board. A small tool that simplifies this operation is included. After 
you've separated the twenty-five-pin connector from the keyboard prop- 
er, position the Repeaterrrr over the encoder board. If you give it a gen- 
tle push, it will slide over all twenty-five pins. In addition to making the 
necessary electrical connections, these pins also serve to hold the Re- 
peaterrrr firmly in place. Next you must connect a small jumper wire to 
one of the components on the encoder board via a simple push-on con- 
nector. Finally, the entire assembly must be mated back with the key- 
board; this completes the installation procedure. 

Initially, the delay before repeating is set at 0.6 seconds. This can be 
adjusted, however, to be between 0.3 and 1.3 seconds, or it can be disabled 
completely. This is sometimes necessary for playing games that use key- 
board control. If you have to turn off the unit, it's a good idea to mark 
the control setting before moving it. Then you can return to your previ- 
ous delay setting after the game. 

The Repeaterrrr works with the newer Apple keyboard and provides 
auto-repeat capability. 

Vista Model 150 Type-Ahead Buffer. For a very modest price, the 
Model 150 from Vista Computer Company adds forty characters of 
type-ahead buffering to any Apple II keyboard, including the older-style 
keyboard. Installation of the tiny board is quite simple but will probably 
require removing the case from your computer. There's no provision for 
clearing the buffer, so the control-C interrupt function and many games 
may not always work. 

The Vista Model 150 type-ahead buffer is compatible with all Apple 
II keyboards. 

ABT Keypad. Advanced Business Technology makes two versions of 
its numeric keypad — one for use with the older one-piece keyboards and 
one for the newer type of keyboard. The Type A keypad for older key- 
boards connects through the keyboard socket on the motherboard. We 
tested the Type B unit, which connects directly into the encoder board. 
This connection is made through a nine-pin D-connector that the en- 
coder board is designed to accept. Since the mating connector is not sup- 
plied by Apple, you'll have to remove the encoder board and install a 
connector that comes with the keypad. This is quite simple but does re- 
quire some soldering. 

After you've put the modified encoder board back in place, you can 
plug in the keypad and place it on either side of the computer. You can 
also remove the keypad any time you need to. 

A wooden stand for the keypad is also available. Called PadLegs, this 
stand raises the keypad to the same height and slope as the Apple key- 
board. 

Apple Numeric Keypad. Apple Computer's numeric keypad con- 
tains twenty-four keys for expanded calculator functions and easy Visi- 
Calc operation. In addition to the numeric keys, there are six math keys 
(plus sign, minus sign, times sign, division sign, and open and closed 
parentheses). These keys can be used with the duplicate print (actually 
"?") and return keys to enter complex calculations from the immediate 
mode of Applesoft. This makes the Apple easier to use as a desk 
calculator. 

Simplifying data entry even further, there are the decimal point and 
"double zero" keys. The double zero key enters two zeros each time you 
press it — very useful when you're working with financial data. For faster 
cursor moves and data entry using VisiCalc, there are also keys that 
duplicate the escape, space, and left and right arrows of the Apple's key- 
board. The arrow keys feature auto-repeat. 

To install the Apple keypad, you add a small interface board in se- 
ries with the keyboard cable. After removing the Apple's case, discon- 
nect the keyboard from the motherboard. Then plug the interface board 
into the empty socket and the keyboard cable to the interface board. This 



board is attached to the keypad by means of another cable. In order for 
the computer to operate, this keypad must remain connected. If it must 
be disconnected for some reason, the interface board must also be 
removed. 

The Apple keypad (formerly available from the Keyboard Compa- 
ny) is a numeric keypad that works with all Apple II keyboards. It offers 
auto-repeat on the arrow keys only. 

Lazer Keyboard -(-Plus. The Keyboard -I- Plus works with old and 
new keyboards. It adds lower-case entry with shift-lock, generates the 
complete ASCII character set, and has a 128 character type-ahead buffer. 
Installation involves mounting the small circuit board on the inside wall 
of the computer and connecting three cables. One of these cables con- 
nects to the Apple motherboard after the keyboard cable has been 
moved to a socket on the Keyboard -fPlus. Another cable connects to a 
small socket adapter, requiring the removal of one IC from the mother- 
board. The final cable goes to the keyboard itself to pick up the control 
and shift key connections. This requires a brief session with the solder- 
ing iron. 

After you've successfully installed the Keyboard -I- Plus, the Apple 
should power up in a normal fashion. The only noticeable change is that 
hitting reset by itself will no longer reset the computer (assuming that it 
used to). A hardware reset can be achieved by holding down the control 
key and pressing reset. Hitting the reset key by itself toggles the shift-lock 
mode off and on. All of the extra ASCII characters are made available 
through pressing the control key in conjunction with various numeric or 
punctuation keys. 

A type-ahead buffer stores up to 128 keystrokes while the computer 
is busy. A special clear buffer command is provided to wipe out pending 
keyboard input. This is accomplished by pressing shift-reset. There are 
also instructions for adding a switch to disable the buffer for game play- 
ing and other pursuits. 

The Keyboard -I- Plus from Lazer MicroSystems is compatible with 
all Apple II keyboards. It provides lower-case entry capability by means

ahead buffer. 

Videx Enhancer II. The Enhancer II is probably one of the most so- 
phisticated attachments available for the Apple keyboard. It consists of a 
completely new encoder board that replaces the existing one (and there- 
fore only works with newer keyboards). It also includes a character gen- 
erator ROM for lower-case display (also known as a lower-case adapter). 

The Enhancer II contains its own microprocessor, complete with 
EPROM and RAM; this accounts for the simplicity and extreme versa- 
tility of the unit. Among the functions provided are lower-case keyboard 
entry (actually, the full 128 character ASCII set), auto and fast repeat, 
keyboard redefinition and macros, and type-ahead buffer. 

Installation of the Enhancer II is comprised of three phases and re- 
quires some disassembly of the computer. First, the lower-case character 
generator ROM must be installed. If you already have one, or if your 
Apple motherboard is a Revision 6 or earlier, this step is not required. 
The next step is to remove the keyboard encoder board and replace it 
with the Enhancer II. The final step is optional but necessary if you want 
to realize all of the new features. It involves adding two wires to the 
motherboard. The instructions provided with the Enhancer II explain in 
detail how to do this. The process consists of removing a couple of ICs, 
inserting the jumper wires into the appropriate holes of the IC sockets, 
and then replacing the ICs. The procedure just outlined is not at all hard; 
if you're adept at soldering and not too squeamish about taking an iron 
to your computer, a neater looking job can be accomphshed by adding 
the wires to the underside of the motherboard. 

Since there are no spare keys on the Apple keyboard to control such 
functions as shift-lock, the Enhancer II calls upon the control, shift, and 
reset keys to perform double duty as command keys. For example, hit- 
ting reset places the keyboard into the caps-lock mode. This mode is 
similar to the standard Apple keyboard operation. 

Pressing shift-reset turns off the caps-lock mode and allows normal 
lower-case entry. In this mode, the keyboard acts like a standard type- 
writer in that all letter keys produce lower case unless the shift key is 



pressed simultaneously. Those keys that used to have a shifted function 
(the at sign as a shift-P, for example) will produce the correct upper-case 
letters as ^propriate. To regain those lost characters, as well as ths rest of 
the ASCII set normally unavailable from the Apple keyboard, various 
combinations of control and control-shift of the number keys are used. 
For example, pressing control-2 yields the~(tilde) character while con- 
trol-shift-8 acts as the left curly bracket key. Pressing the control key by 
itself engages a shift-lock mode whereby all subsequent keystrokes act as 
if the shift key were bang held down. Unlike in the caps-lock mode, wdiidi 
only shifts alphabetic keys, pressing the 4 key in the shift-lock mode gives 
the dollar sign character (shift-4) as expected. The shift-lock mode is easi- 
ly cancelled by pressing either shift key. 

Since the Enhancer II has assigned additional functions to the reset 
key, it would be awkward if the computer executed a hardware reset each 
time this button was pressed. Therefore, with the Enhancer II installed, 
you're required to press control-reset to perform this function (many 
Apples are configured this way to prevent accidental resets). A small 
jumper is provided, however, to restore reset-only operation or to dis- 
able the hardware reset function completely from the keyboard. 

Another feature of the Enhancer II is auto-repeat on all keys and 
fast-repeat using the repeat key. Holding a key down for more than 
three-fourths of a second causes it to repeat at about fourteen times per 
second. Pressing the repeat key allows instant repetition at twice that 
rate. There's also a 128 character type-ahead buffer. 

In the event that you make a mistake or change your mind about 
some characters in the buffer, there are two ways to empty or flush the 
contents of the buffer — hitting reset or hitting control-C. The latter com- 
mand is included to avoid a possible problem with running Basic pro- 
grams. While a program is running, it is usually scanning the keyboard at 
regular intervals to see if a control-C has been pressed. If so, the program 
halts and returns to the immediate, or command, mode. 

With the type-ahead buffer, however, it's possible to enter characters 
while a program is running. But until they're specifically asked for by the 
program (via an input statement, for example), these keystrokes will re- 
main within the buffer. If you were to try typing control-C in an at- 
tempt to stop the program, this character would just sit at the end of the 
buffer and the computer would never see it. Thus the program would 
continue running until it reached an end statement or until enough 
characters were read from the buffer to allow the control-C to be passed 
on to the system. By allowing the control-C keystroke to flush the buff- 
er, the Enhancer ensures that the control-C will be sent to the program 
immediately. Like most of the other features of the Enhancer II, both the 
control-C flush and the entire type-ahead buffer can be defeated if 
you wish. 

The Enhancer II has the ability to define up to 170 single-character 
macros or one 510 character macro. Assigning macros from the key- 
board is quite simple. First, the macro definition mode is enabled by typ- 
ing control-shift-repeat. Next, the keyboard character to which the 
macro is to be assigned is typed. Any and all keys typed after this be- 
come part of the macro (including escape and return). The end of the 
macro definition is signaled by pressing the repeat key. Individual macro 
definitions can later be cleared or the entire macro list can be erased by 
typing repeat-reset. 

The best part about the Enhancer's macro facility is the speed and 
ease with which you can use it to create macros. This makes it much 
more likely that you will make frequent use of this capability. Another 
nice thing about these macros is that the definitions are stored in the En- 
hancer's private RAM. Thus they cannot be wiped out by changing 
programs, booting disks, and so on. You can even use them with 
protected software such as games and business programs. 

Macro definitions can also be loaded from disk by means of a spe- 
cial Download program. The download operation can be used to disable 
the shift-lock and to select and lock the keyboard mode. It can also be 
used to disable any of the following: the auto-repeat capability, the type- 
ahead buffer, the ability to enter and clear keyboard macros, and the 
download functions. 

The Enhancer II comes with a utility disk and a hefty user manual. 
The disk contains programs that modify Basic, the Monitor, Pascal, and 
Apple Writer to allow lower-case entry and display. Two other pro-

Volume TWO! 



T.M. 

by Bob Nacon 



The success of the original Amper-Magic program package and the 
Introduction of Its technique for attaching new commands to Applesoft 
programs has stimulated the production of Command Library" packages 
designed around a 'theme' such as Information display or output, Input, 
memory management, etc., which will enhance your Applesoft programs. They 
will give your program a professional operation and appearance by 
increasing speed, reducing size, and giving you features you never could 
have before, while still allowing you to program with the ease of BASIC. 

Ampei — Magic Command Library No. 2 Is dedicated to Information display 
and output capabilities. Read on and enjoy the new programming power 
Ampei — Magic Command Library No. 2 will give you. 

This disk contains 27 machine language routines ready to be Inserted 
quickly and painlessly into your own Applesoft programs. Included among 
them is the most powerful PRINT USING routine yet created for Applesoft, 
as wel I as some sma I I but very handy routines for control I I ng the appear- 
ance and activity on the display screen. 

In order to use these commands, you wll I need the Ampei — Magic program 
Itself which is contained on Volume One. SOME commands on this disk are: 

** Access the most powerful PRINT USING command EVER for the Apple. 
It sure does more than just line up decimal points! It works with 
strings of characters as wel I as numbers, and lets the program de- 
cide whether to make them Flash or Inverse or Normal depending on 
conditions you specify. With numbers, you can have fixed or 
floating dollar sign and/or optional commas and a variety of fill 
characters. You can embed standard phrases within your format de- 
sign. You can even print to the screen WHILE outputting to the 
printer! And generate NO GARBAGE to collect! All In all, the 
most powerful PRINT USING yet! 

** Print to the screen while a peripheral is active 

** Save and restore Instantly any text screen, no matter how complex 
with flashing, inverse, and any window settings... 

** Make your program WAIT a length of time specified In ordinary sec- 
onds (to the tenth of a second); the time may be a variable or 
expression which can be controlled by the program... 

** Print anywhere on the screen under program control, either with 
absolute movements or with relative movements... 

** Print string arrays to any device, with or without an appended 
special character, and WITHOUT A LOOP... 

** Set, clear, or toggle ANY bit or bits anywhere In RAM memory... 

** Check the keyboard when called, pause If SPACEBAR Is pressed, then 
continue If SPACE Is pressed again or GOTO a location If RETURN Is 
pressed... 

** Print the current text screen on command or from the program... 

** Send ASCII characters to peripheral devices and POKE peripheral 
card memory to set or clear bits for control purposes...

grams, Macro Editor and Download, take care of creating macro defini- 
tion and operating mode files and loading them into the Enhancer II. 

The Enhancer II documentation deserves considerable praise. It's 
very thorough (offering everything from detailed installation instruc- 
tions with photos to complete schematics and program listings), and it's 
easy to read. Many examples are given to aid the novice. And for the ad- 
vanced programmer, a wealth of technical data and information on 
related topics is contained in the appendixes. 

An optional Function Strip to work with the Enhancer is also avail- 
able. This is a thin membrane keyboard consisting of sixteen "touch" 
switches. The keyboard strip attaches to the lower lip on the Apple's 
cover, just above the keyboard. It connects via a flat cable to the exter- 
nal keypad input of the Enhancer (after the mating connector has been 
mounted there). Each of the sixteen keys can be defined in the usual 
manner to represent often-used commands. 

The Enhancer II works with the newer-style Apple II keyboard. It 
provides lower-case entry by means of the shift keys, shift-lock, auto- 
repeat, and type-ahead buffer. Keyboard macros can be used. 

EPS Detachable Keyboard. The ultimate keyboard "enhancement" 
would have to be something like the detachable keyboard from Executive 
Peripheral Systems. This is a completely separate, self-contained key- 
board that can be connected to the Apple. This unit was unavailable for 
evaluation. Here's a brief description of its features based on informa- 
tion derived from the sales brochure supplied by the manufacturer. 

The EPS keyboard starts with the full upper-case and lower-case 
alphabet and includes a separate shift-lock key. All of the common 
ASCII punctuation characters can be found among the 102 keys on this 
unit. There are six cursor movement keys, including the four direction 
keys (which are laid out in an "inverted T" configuration). Another six 
editing keys enable you to perform such functions as inserting a line, 
deleting a line, inserting a character, and so on. 

On the right side of the keyboard is a numeric data entry pad; it con- 
tains double and triple zero keys, keys for the decimal point and the

comma, and double-size enter keys. Along the top of the keyboard are 
twelve special function keys that can be assigned according to the pro- 
gram being used. 

Each key, including the cursor control and editing keys, can be de- 
fined through the use of Promware modules. These modules tailor the 
keyboard to work with such programs as VisiCalc, Apple Writer II, PFS, 
and WordStar. Each module comes with a plastic overlay strip that de- 
lineates the operation of the special function keys (each of which can 
represent a single character operation or a multiple character macro). All 
keys offer auto-repeat when held down. 

The EPS keyboard is a lightweight unit that you can place on your 
lap if you wish. It connects to the Apple motherboard (it doesn't take up 
a peripheral slot) via a six-foot coiled cable. The keyboard also has a 
storage compartment for extra Promware modules and overlay labels. 

The EPS keyboard provides lower-case entry capability by means of 
the shift keys, shift-lock, all ninety-six ASCII characters, auto-repeat, 
and a numeric keypad. Keyboard macros and function key capability are 
also available. 

Other Data Entry Devices. Not all data and control functions need 
be entered via keyboard devices. Cursor motions, for example, are much 
simpler to direct via mechanical transducers such as the joystick, track- 
ball, or mouse. 

Most people are familiar with the joystick as a gaming device. It 
transforms two-dimensional motion into signals that the computer can 
interpret. From these signals the computer is able to determine the exact 
location of the stick at any time and can cause a program to react ac- 
cordingly. 

QuikVis. Kraft Systems has just released QuikVis, a joystick cursor 
control for VisiCalc. After you've prebooted using the QuikVis disk, you 
can load VisiCalc and connect a joystick to the Apple's game I /O port to 
control the cursor. Moving the stick away from its center position 
(spring-return centering of the joystick is recommended) causes the cur- 
sor to move up, down, sideways, or diagonally. Pressing one of the but- 
tons on the joystick increases the speed of the cursor motion. Pressing the 
other button causes the cursor to "home" to the Al position. 

The Trackball. This device is somewhat similar lo a joystick. It uses 
a rotating sphere mounted in a housing so that only the top surface of the 
ball is exposed. By guiding the ball with your fingers in any direction, 
you can produce results similar to those you'd get using the joystick. Due 
to its construction, however, the trackball can offer more precise con- 
trol, especially when moving an object such as a cursor. 

The Mouse. There are basically two kinds of mice (mouses?) — opti- 
cal and mechanical. An optical mouse uses an optical sensor to detect 
two-dimensional motion over a grid-lined tablet. Mechanical mice are 
more common. If you were to shrink a trackball a little and turn it up- 
side down, the result would resemble a mechanical mouse. 

Operating a mechanical mouse is somewhat different from using the 
trackball — now the housing is moved around with the ball rolling on the 
table underneath to indicate movement. If you need to move farther in 
one direction than the cord will allow, you simply pick up the mouse, 
move it back in the opposite direction, set it down, and continue the mo- 
tion. Of course, while the mouse is off the table, it does not register any 
movement. 

At present, the mouse seems to be generating the most interest as an 
auxiliary input device. Manufacturers of many of the latest computers 
and software are considering it to be standard equipment. VisiCorp's 
VisiOn is an example of this trend. Making these kinds of devices stan- 
dard items instead of add-on options and incorporating software to util- 
ize their potential will greatly increase the acceptance of such devices. 
Other input devices that may see wider use in the future are light pens, 
bar wands, touch screens, and voice recognition units. Ji

Using a modem opens the entire world of information communica- 
tions to your Apple. To take advantage of it all, computers must find a 
common means of communicating. The means, a system of signals and 
behaviors, is called protocol. 

Protocol in computers, as in diplomacy, refers to a set of behaviors 
commonly understood by their users. The signals that a modem interprets 
as the end of an incoming transmission and sends back to acknowledge 
receipt of the signal are part of that system's protocol. Some machines re- 



quire line feeds, others don't; they use different protocols. Unless the pro- 
tocols they understand match, computers can't talk to each other. 

Some terminal programs for the Apple include routines that under- 
stand and translate some protocols that aren't native to the Apple into 
signals the Apple can understand. 

With data communications networks, however, you don't have to 
think about protocol at all.

adjust protocols at their central computer to match those of the comput- 
er calling in. 

Networks are truly shrinking the world and enlarging the universe. 
With the availability of networks now spreading to home computerists in 
addition to businesses, task and information services and huge general 
and specialized databases are available to all our homes. 

Four major networks lead the field today. Telenet, from General 
Telephone Electronics, and Tymnet, from Tymshare, share 38 percent 
of the market. Fast ascending are American Telephone & Telegraph's 
brand-new American Bell sprout. Advanced Information System/Net 1, 
and ADP's AutoNet. 

How They Work. Generally, data transmission networks attempt to 
have nodes in every metropolitan area. A node is often a minicomputer. 
When you call in through a modem on the Apple, the minicomputer sup- 
plies the correct protocol. In effect, your signal is massaged into the 
proper form to be sent long distance to the host computer of the service 
you're using. 

In some cases, the networks offer reduced-rate telephone service, 
such as incoming WATS lines, to lessen the strain on users' pocketbooks. 

Businesses and interested groups buy minimum blocks of this time at 
a set per-hour cost. Zenith, for example, buys blocks of time for its net- 
work for internal ordering from distributors. 

But the network clients that have the most significance for comput- 
er-loving homes are the information and task services. The Source, Com- 
puServe, Dow Jones News/ Retrieval Service, and many smaller infor- 
mation services operate through the big networks. They buy blocks of 
time from the networks; subscribers to the services then pay fees to the 
services to cover their network costs and the costs of their features. 

Business-oriented features are most used during the workday, par- 
ticularly late afternoon, when many companies enter electronic mail — 
and thus they provide the slowest service. Hobbyist features suffer in the 
evenings, on weekends, and on holidays. Responses that take a fraction 
of a second during less busy times can take several seconds during 
rush hours. 

Part of the delay comes from overload at the host computer; part of 
it is from the heavy workload at the local node. 

The most economical means for using data transmission networks or 
information services are terminal programs. They make it easy to sign on 
to the network, download into memory material you want (such as elec- 
tronic mail or stock quotes), and sign off. Then you can save the items in 
memory onto disk or print them out — without paying for time on the 
service while you're doing it. 

Similarly, when you're ready to reply, you may write messages, com- 
pile information, or select a program before you sign on to the network, 
then sign on and upload it in the appropriate place in the least pos- 
sible time. 

Thus, terminal programs keep your time on the network, and your 
subsequent charges, to a minimum. 

So, the data transmission networks are the means by which all vari- 
eties of computers talk to each other. Now, what will they talk about? 
Here's where the information and task services enter the picture — and 
the monitor screen. 

The Source, CompuServe, Dow Jones News/ Retrieval Service, and 
an increasing number of on-line databases provide information in detail 
(or not — remember your Apple can select if given the opportunity) on 
many general-interest subjects and in several specialized fields. Besides 
straight information, they offer opportunities for distant individuals to 
exchange letters electronically and for strangers to find other like-mind- 
ed strangers for sharing any number of interests. 

Among the services becoming more and more prevalent are those 
that enable users to investigate travel possibilities and make air, car 
rental, and lodging reservations directly. Within a few years — which may 
be an underestimation — it will be possible to use such services to pur- 
chase groceries. 

Specialized databases are springing up in many fields. An opthal- 
mological service, being set up now, will offer any eye doctor with a com- 
puter the opportunity to call in symptoms for diagnostic information, to 
keep up with the most recently discovered treatments, and generally to 
follow up-to-the-minute research and progress being made in the field. 



There is even a database for horse breeders, expected to go on-line this 
spring; racehorse trainer Darrell Vienna and other forward-looking 
horse people will be able to learn the complete bloodlines of any regis- 
tered Thoroughbred merely by typing its name into the computer. 

The most widely used data communications services at present are 
the general-interest Source and CompuServe and the investment-ori- 
ented Dow Jones News/Retrieval. 

The Source. Perhaps the best known of the database services, the 
Source started small and independent; now it's large and owned by 
Reader's Digest Association, a company that puts out a mildly popular 
magazine of which you may have heard. 

Offering service at speeds of 300 or 1200 baud, the Source provides 
menus, but experienced users can bypass the menus to save time and 
money. Members in any of the 360 cities served by Tymnet or Telenet 
can use those networks for their Source calls; outside those areas, the 
Source provides a WATS line at less cost than long-distance phone rates. 

Mike Rawl, director of public relations and advertising for the 
Source, describes the services the Source offers by category 

"One category consists of travel services. You can use the Source to 
look at ail the airline schedules and figure out connecting flights. 
Through an on-line travel club, you can reserve a car and hotel room. 
You can check the weather at your destination, review the restaurants 
and hotels, even check out movies you might catch while you're there. 

"News, reference, and research comprise another category. The 
Source gives you access to the United Press International news service, 
which you can read just as it comes over the wire or which you can 
search for special interests, using as many as three keywords at a time. It 
has management news, summaries of all articles in the twenty-seven lead- 
ing business publications, and a sjDecial service called Information on De- 
mand, which is the gateway to more than one hundred fifty research-ori- 
ented databases. Source staff members search any of the databases for 
you, transferring the information you request back to you by computer." 

The third category, according to Rawl, is communicadon, including 
electronic mail, on-line bulletin boards, a Mailgram message service in 




PhotoCaster...a new feature packed system to take, 
process, store, print, send and receive color and black- 
and-wliite photos with your Apple II computer.

which messages sent by late afternoon are guaranteed next day delivery, 
and a computer conferencing service. 

Electronic mail involves more than just leaving messages in other in- 
dividuals' Source "boxes." Indeed, you can create a distribution list for 
regular mailings. For example, a business with a list of two hundred 
salespeople with access to terminals of any kind could send a single mes- 
sage to all of them. 

Sending such a message express would place it in front of all other 
messages in the receiving mailboxes, and the sender could place a re- 
quest that would keep the message recipients from moving on to other 
messages until they replied. 

Access to mainframe computers is another category of service the 
Source provides. Through your Apple and the Source, you can pro- 
gram, compute, or make financial models, storing your work on main- 
frames in languages such as Fortran, Pascal, and Info-X. 

Also from mainframes come professional investment services includ- 
ing continually updated market quotations, news and price data from all 
commodity markets, detailed analytical data about ail common stocks, 
advice from investment columnists, and the UPI business wire. 

A library of consumer services comprises yet another category of serv- 
ice: read United Media Features columns; keep hale with the help of a 
health care database; shop electronically by browsing among more than 
fifty thousand items at discounts of up to 40 percent; post your resume or 
nose through those of others. 

Finally, it's time for fun, and, appropriately, the last category is 
games. More than sixty games are open for play on the Source; they are 
strategic games or logical or mental puzzles rather than fast-action ar- 
cade games. 

But games are the frosting not on cake, but on good solid meat and 
potatoes. Says Rawl, "What we're really trying to provide for is use, 
practical use. That's what's going to make the difference between the 
Source being something people try and something they use every day." 

Still, there's a fine line between the practical and the not quite so 
practical. A recent addition to the Source's service is an electronic news- 
paper staffed by eight journalists who contribute information daily. 

"When the National Basketball Association draft was going on, we 



put it up round by round," says Rawl. "It was information you couldn't 
find anywhere else." 

CompuServe. Also offering 200 baud and 1200 baud service in more 
than three hundred cities via local telephone calls, CompuServe features 
EMAIL (an electronic mailbox), a national bulletin board, a citizens' 
band radio simulator, access to the Associated Press wire service, finan- 
cial and portfolio management programs under an umbrella called Mi- 
croQuote, use of various programming languages, and memory storage 
space. The company provides a special commercial branch for large busi- 
ness users. 

There's no way to avoid CompuServe's menus, and some users con- 
sider that its biggest drawback. Every time you turn a CompuServe page, 
which is the equivalent of going to a different feature, the entire menu 
prints on-screen. To experienced users, this procedure seems a costly fill- 
er. It's possible to jump direcdy to various pages if you know their code 
names; but you still must tolerate their menus when you get there. 

Rich Baker of CompuServe describes a unique feature of the system: 
the closed user group. A wholesaler, for example, formed such a group, 
limited to his customers, and gave each his CompuServe user number 
and a password. When the wholesaler's customers sign on, they're 
shunted to a certain workspace inside the host computer. There they find 
messages, product lists with up-to-the-minute prices and inventory con- 
ditions, and electronic order forms. The system is set up so that, when 
the forms are filled in, all the calculations, including prices, taxes, and 
discounts, are done automatically. 

Through the use of the closed group service, which costs more than 
the basic service, companies can form their own common databases. As 
they update information on the common database, all reports, surveys, 
or projections stored on the database reflect the changes instantly. 

Dow Jones News/ Retrieval Service. For years, high finance has 
been synonymous in the United States with Wall Street; and, for many of 
those years, the image of Wall Street has been the image of a stock- 
broker anxiously reading the tape of latest prices as it comes off the tick-

Ticker tape so represented the American spirit of enterprise and cour- 
age that we came to honor our heroes by raining the long white strips

upon them as they paraded among the skyscrapers of New York City. 

Tomorrow's heroes will have to parade amid the confetti of shred- 
ded printouts instead of quote-filled streamers: the personal computer is 
rapidly supplanting the stock ticker. 

Dow Jones offers a range of services for computerized investors, in- 
cluding news in more than eighty categories on more than six thousand 
companies and more than fifty industries. 

The company provides financial services; text searches, to find any 
combination of words, dates, or numbers back to June 1979; quotes 
from various stock exchanges, with a fifteen minute delay; historical 
quotes; disclosures; money market news; weather reports; and 
sports news. 

Dow Jones also offers its service at either 300 baud or 1200 baud. 

The personal computer is so efficient for investors that numerous 
programs have been published to enhance use of the Dow Jones 
News/ Retrieval Service. One of the oldest, recently updated, is Apple's 
Dow Jones News & Quotes Reporter. Giving instant access to the Dow 
Jones News/ Retrieval Service, the program enables users to select only 
the reports and articles they want to print out. 

Through the program, you can select news by category or by stock 
symbol. On the screen appear the headlines of stories from the last ninety 
days with the date and vehicle of their pubhcation. Choose the ones you 
wish to read in full and the program presents them; if you want to print 
them, it will do that too. 

Note that the News & Quotes Reporter seems to believe that all the 
news that's fit to print isn't necessarily fit to save on disk. You can't save 
anything on disk; which means you must stay expensively logged on to 
the service throughout the printing process to keep a record of anything 
you see. 

The program also calls up the stock quote service, providing current 
quotes on common and preferred stocks, bonds, mutual funds, war- 
rants, options, and Treasury issues from the New York, American, Mid- 
west, and Pacific stock exchanges. 

Dow Jones News & Quotes Reporter is a quick and simple way to 
keep an eye on Wall Street.

Also from Apple, and also old enough to b»e a candidate for venera- 
tion, is the Dow Jones Series Portfolio Evaluator. With room on disk to 
store, modify, and update a hundred portfolios of up to fifty stocks each, 
this program logs on to the Dow Jones service, graphs current quota- 
tions, tabulates the gains or losses of each portfolio instantly, and dis- 
plays the results on-screen or on a printout. It also evaluates stocks in a 
portfolio. 

Dow Jones's own Market Analyzer retrieves daily price histories and 
closing quotes and automatically puts the information on a work disk, 
tracking fifty-two stock symbols for 256 days or a double deck of sym- 
bols for six months. 

Then comes the fun. The Market Analyzer draws what it sees in col- 
or bar charts and line charts. 

Many other companies publish investment programs, and some of 
the best programs are from some of the smallest companies; so look 
around. 

Independent On-Line Databases. There are nearly as many special- 
ized databases as there are fields of interest; in the future, the popularity 
of a subject will be a determining factor not in whether it has a database 
devoted to it, but in how many such sources there are. Everything will be 
represented. 

Most of these spring from publications and organizations that have 
developed specialized pockets of interest into electronic information 
banks. From databases like this you can learn how many tons of steel 
were shipped in July 1982, what damage the Medfly did, and what chem- 
icals constituted the bug spray used against it. Lots more too, but surely 
that much knowledge will impress your friends. 

A recent issue of the Directory of On-Line Databases illustrates the 
range of information your Apple can get you. It shows three accounting 
databases; two on aeronautics; eight serving agriculture; four on aquatic 
sciences; and, skipping to the other end of the alphabet, three databases 
covering technology transfer; ten on transportation; five on urban plan- 
ning; and one on urban studies. 

On-Line databases come in two flavors: reference databases and 
source databases. Reference databases are gigantic, glorified indexes of 
the Reader's Guide variety. Their function is to send their users to other 
sources; their arguments are bibliographic citations and abstracts. 

Source databases are the ones that reference databases send you to. 
They contain the complete data on particular subjects and often offer 
original unabridged text. 

Specialized databases are not always distributed by their creators. 
For example, Lockheed Information Systems and two other database 
services distribute Oceanic Abstracts from the Cambridge Scientific Ab- 
stracts. Lockheed's system provides the offerings of more than a hun- 
dred database developers. 

Some of the specialized on-line databases are expensive; but, should 
your work or your interest compel you to seek one, you already have 
more than six hundred to choose from. 

As the popularity of computers increases and as people's awareness 
of the wealth of information and fun available through modem use 
spreads, costs will drop and breadth of subjects will increase. I]|

THE LEGENDARY FANTASY 
ROLE-PLAYING SIMULATION 

... In "Proving Grounds of the Mad' 
Overlord" you begin a challenging and 
totally absorbing journey through a 10- 
level, 3-dimensional maze. Create, then 
command, a hearty band of up to six 
adventurers who all must cooperate to 
explore a deep and mysterious maze in 
search of loot and glory. 

The mages cast spells; thieves plot 
to steal treasure; and warriers battle 
the monstrous fiends of the under- 
world. In Wizardry®, no one remains 
unchanged; each member of the party 
grows in age, experience and, you 
hope, wisdom. 

The puzzles, passageways and per- 
sonalities in "Proving Grounds" have 
already fascinated and astounded the 
computer world and created a dedi- 
^ cated following of players. Find out 
why— place yourself under the 
spell of Wizardry®. 




KNIGHT OF DIAMONDS . . . 
THE SECOND SCENARIO 

The characters with whom you 
fought through to the 10th level in 
"Proving Grounds" must now call upon 
every ounce of resourcefulness to save 
the City of Llylgamyn. In fact, they 
must have reached the 13th level of 
power merely to survive! 

The same high resolution, 3-dimen- 
sional visual effects that thrilled you in 
the first scenario are here— and more. 
"Knight of Diamonds," so eagerly antic- 
ipated by Wizardry players everywhere, 
surpasses highest expectations for 
story, action and complexity. 

If successful, you will return the 
enchanted staff of Gnilda to Llylgamyn 
and become the Knight of Diamonds, 
but formidable adversaries block you 
at every turn. To begin your quest, 
simply place yourself under the spell 
of Wizardry®

Everyone's Guide to Assembly Language, Part 30 



It's time now to examine the input system of the Apple. Many paral- 
lels can be drawn between it and the output system, discussed last time. 
Though not required, some familiarity with last month's major points 
will help you understand our current topic. 

The main demo routines in this installment involve lower-case text; 
therefore, it's strongly recommended that you acquire lower-case dis- 
play hardware, if you don't have it already. Lower-case chips for Apples 
with revision numbers greater than 7 can be set up for $20 to $30. Earlier 
Apples require more than a single chip. Apple lie doesn't require any ad- 
ditional software or hardware; the lower-case display capability is built 
in. For serious study and exploration of text input /output methods, low- 
er-case capability is essentially required. 

The Input Vector — KSW. The byte pair $38,39 constitutes the main 
input vector and is generally labeled KSW for keyboard input 
switch. Like CSW (the character output switch), KSW is used to 
switch input to Basic and the Monitor from different sources. As is evi- 
dent from the fact that an input statement will read a DOS text file and 
the action of the exec command on text files, the keyboard isn't the only 
place from which the Apple can obtain ASCII data 

When you're writing a machine language program that needs a 
single-character input from the outside world, the usual procedure is to 
do a JSR RDKEY ($FDOC) and then to use the value that is returned in 
the accumulator. 

As we did with COUT ($FDED), let's see what RDKEY does to get 
that character. To examine the routine, enter the Monitor with the usual 
call -151 and list the code at $FDOC by typing: 

FDOCL

RETURN WITH CHAR 



On entry to RDKEY the first three instructions read the character on 
the Apple screen and put it onto the stack. Remember that what you see 
on-screen is the representation of a byte stored in the memory range of 
$400— $7FF. To determine what byte corresponds to a screen position, 
you need only load the Y register with the horizontal cursor position 
(CH = $24) and add this offset to the base address for the current line. 
This base address is always stored in $28,29 (BASL,BASH). 

Once the existing character on-screen has been read and stored (so we 
can put it back on-screen after the input), the next three instructions have 
the net effect of putting a flashing character on the screen equivalent to 
the character that was on-screen in the current cursor position. 

The action of the ANDs and ORAs may not be intuitively obvious. 
Let's consider this example:

Remember that the action of the AND is to clear any bits in the ac- 
cumulator that are matched by a 0 in the mask value. Bits in the accu- 
mulator matched by Is in the mask are left unchanged, whether they are 
Os or Is. 

An ORA, on the other hand, sets to 1 any bits in the accumulator 
that are matched by a 1 in the mask value. Bits in the accumulator 
matched by Os in the mask are left unchanged. 

You might wonder at first why two instructions — the AND fol- 
lowed by the ORA — were needed. After all, in last month's column 
didn't we change control characters to inverse in just one step? Why not 
just use a different mask value to get flashing characters? The answer lies 
in the differences between the bit patterns for inverse and flashing char- 
acters. All inverse characters have the top two bits clear (bits 6 and 7). 
Flashing characters, on the other hand, have one bit clear (bit 7 = 0) and 
the other set (bit 6 = 1). 

When the cursor is on a character and the character is to be convert- 
ed to flashing temporarily, we must not only clear the high bit (at least 
for all "normal" text), but must also on occasion set bit 6. This combi- 
nation of a set and a clear requires two operations. 

Once RDKEY has thus put a flashing character on-screen to show 
the cursor's location, the character originally on the screen is retrieved 
from the stack in preparation for the jump to KEYIN (or any other in- 
put routine that will want to restore the original character if no new char- 
acter is entered). Finally, the actual indirect jump via KSW is done. 

In COUT ($FDED), the jump via CSW was made immediately. This 
extra portion in RDKEY preceding the actual jump explains the pres- 
ence of the cursor on-screen during a text file read. Although DOS is 
handling the input at that point, the call is still done via RDKEY, and 
thus the presence of the cursor is still somewhat unavoidable. 

If DOS is not active, KSW ordinarily points to KEYIN (SFDIB). 
KEYIN is the routine responsible for getting characters from the key- 
board; it thus involves the keyboard memory hardware ($C000 and 
$C010) directly. If input was from a modem or some other external de- 
vice installed in a peripheral slot, KSW would point to Cnxx, where n is 
the slot number and xx is the input routine entry point. Before consider- 
ing the unusual situations, let's see what happens most of the time, when 
KSW points to KEYIN. 

KEYIN first inaements the random number byte pair, $4E,4F. This 
is a part of the loop that will be repeated until a key is pressed. The the- 
ory is that the passage of time between keypresses is random. This byte 
pair is used primarily by Integer Basic. Applesoft has its own random 
number registers and routines. 

After incrementing the random byte pair, KEYIN2 then does the ac- 
tual keyboard check, repeating the process by going back to KEYIN if 
no key is pressed. Remember that the BIT instruction makes the test pos- 
sible by setting the sign flag of the status register equal to bit 7 of the 
character value detected at the keyboard ($C000). BPL can thus be used 
to detect (by failing) when bit 7 goes high (bit 7=1), indicating a 
keypress. 

Once a key has been pressed, the value in the accumulator is put back

into screen memory. Remember that this is the value of the old charac- 
ter presumably there, not the new character input. If the character en- 
tered is a right arrow, this signifies that we want to move the cursor over 
the displayed character without changing that character. TheLDA KBD 
is what puts the input character into the accumulator, at which point the 
strobe is cleared by accessing SCO 10 and the final return is done. The 
calling program then has the option of printing the input character to the 
screen. 

Other Input Sources. KSW does not always point to RDKEY. In 
fact, it doesn't point there when DOS is installed. With DOS booted and 
active, enter the Monitor and type in: 

38.39 AA55.AA56 

You should get: 

0036- 81 9E 
AA55- IB FD 

You'll see that KSW actually points to DOS at $9E81, which then 
eventually points to RDKEY (SFDIB) at $AA55,AA56. Like the out- 
put system, DOS is rather permanently made part of the input path. Any 
attempts to disconnect DOS by modifying KSW directiy will be undone 
by DOS if any output is done. DOS has its own internal input vector at 
$AA55,AA56. It alters this vector, not KSW, as needed to gain access to 
various slots (or to disk files, as is appropriate). 

You can install your own routine into the input path by means of a 
procedure similar to the one used last month to intercept the output 
path. Put the low and high order bytes of the destination address into 
KSW ($38,39 = 56,57 decimal) and do a call to $3EA (1002 decimal). 
This causes DOS to change its own vectors at $AA55,AA56 to the ad- 
dress specified, and then to restore KSW so that it points to DOS again, 
usuaUy $9E81. 

In Applesoft this would take the form: 

10 POKE 56,LB: POKE 57, HB: CALL 1002 



In this example, LB and HB are the low and high order bytes of the 
destination address. In machine language, it would look like this: 

LDA #LB 
STA $38 
LDA #HB 
STA $39 
JSR $3EA 

Just as output has two basic classes of routines, there are two main 
types of input routines — those that intercept incoming characters and do 
some sort of processing, and those that entirely replace the input rou- 
tines already being used. If you are doing the latter, things are fairly sim- 
ple. Once installed, your routine is entirely in charge of getting the input 
character; and when that character is "got," your routine ends with an 
RTS to pass control back to the calling program. This approach is simi- 
lar to our custom output routines from last month. 

The first class of input routines, in which incoming characters are to 
be intercepted, must be handled slightly differently than output experi- 
ments were. 

Interception Routines. When we were dealing with the output proc- 
ess, the point at which we intercepted the data flow really didn't matter. 
Because the calling program loads the accumulator with the character to 
be output, the character can be examined at any point along the way. 
With input, the character input is not available until the very end of the 
procedure, when the RTS returns control to the calling program. Fortu- 
nately, there is a relatively easy way around this limitation. 

In both the input and output systems, the links in the process are 
done by means of a series of jumps (as opposed to JSRs). You'll recall 
that in our output interception last month the final exit from the routine 
was a jump to SFDFO (or wherever) after the processing was done. 

With input, the secret is to do a JSR to KEYIN (or wherever) first 
and then do your processing, followed by an eventual RTS to the calling 
program. 

For our first experiment, we'll try writing a routine to convert all in- 
coming characters to lower case:

In theory, anything you type in now should be displayed in lower 
case. Numeric and control characters should be unaffected. The routine 
works by first calling KEYIN, which gets a character from the keyboard 
and puts it in the accumulator. At that point our routine ensures that 
we've got a capital letter, rather than a numeric or control character. If 
we don't have an alphabetic character value less than $C1, then the rou- 
tine skips to DONE. 

If what we have is an alphabetic character, the conversion to lower 
case is done by forcing bit 5 of the ASCII value to 1. The values of all 
lower-case characters are equal to the values of the corresponding up- 
per-case letters plus 32. This means, as an ASCII chart showing bit 
values reveals, that capital letters have bit 5 clear and lower-case letters 
have bit 5 set. Line 13 of our routine sets bit 5, thus converting the char- 
acter to lower case. Finally, line 14 returns us to the calling program. 

Our routine should work from within Applesoft. Try this: 

10 POKE 56,0: POKE 57,3: CALL 1002 

20 INPUT "ENTER A STRING:";I$ 

30 PRINT 1$ 

40 PRINT CHR$(4);"IN#0":REM DISCONNECT ROUTINE 

Don't be surprised if this program doesn't work. Try changing line 20 
to look like this: 



We've sot EDU-WARE® educational 
software that impresses even 
the toughest critic* 




Now run the program. The results this time should be more like you 
expected. Line 30 is used to confirm the fact that the lower-case data we 
typed in on line 20 actually made it to Applesoft. 

The question now is, why didn't the first program work? In a sense it 
did. If you like, go back and run the first program without line 40. When 
the program ends, go into the Monitor and check the DOS input vector 
at $AA55,AA56. It should indicate that our routine at $300 is 
being used. 

The problem lies in Applesoft's use of the GETLN (get line) routine 
for the input statement. This routine is used to input entire lines at a time. 
Although GETLN does use the RDKEY routine to get individual char- 
acters, it unfortunately tampers with the characters entered before it re- 
turns the data to Applesoft, DOS, or the Monitor. 

Specifically, GETLN converts any lower-case characters coming in 
to upper case. Thus, even though our routine converts the upper-case 
characters coming in through the keyboard to lower case, GETLN un- 
does everything by converting them back before they're even edioed to 
the screen. 

Another annoyance of GETLN is that it converts charactCTS that 
you copy from the screen using the right arrow. 

The reason the program works with the new version of line 20 is that 
the Applesoft get statement uses a direct call RDKEY and does not use 
GETLN. 

One way to solve the problem of the input statement not working is 
by writing your own input routine instead of using the get sequence. 
The easiest thing to do here would probably be to copy the GETLN rou- 
tine and eliminate the conversion portion starting at $FD7E. 

Instead, let's see if we can improve on the simple input routine just 
shown, making it a little more flexible, without rewriting the GETLN 
routine. 

Something More Useful. Although the routine just given illustrates 
the concept of intercepting input, it's not really that useful, since it pro- 
vides no way of switching between upper and lower-case letters at will. 
Why not create an input routine that allows us to shift between upper 
and lower-case letters as we input them? As we did for the output rou- 
tine last month, we'll first make a list of what we want the routine to do: 

1 . The routine should allow numeric and control characters to pass 
through unaltered. 

2. The routine should be set up such that pressing escape once when 
in the lower-case mode will shift only the next letter to a capital letter. 

3. Pressing escape twice when in lower-case mode should shift aU 
successive input to the upper-case mode (this is sometimes called "caps 
lock"). 

4. Pressing escape once when in the upper-case mode should return 
the system to the lower-case mode. 

The system of using escape as a shift key is somewhat standard. Be- 
fore going on to the listing, though, let's think a little more about what is 
needed to implement this system. First off, we'll need some way to re- 
member which mode (lower-case or upper-case) we're in. The most di- 
rect way of doing this is to use a flag, which we'll call CSFLG (for case 
flag). To avoid zero page conflict, we'll reserve a place for the flag at the 
end of the routine. 

In order to fulfill the requirement stated in item three on our list, we 
need to store the value of the last character input, that is, the character 
just before the one currently being input, in another storage location. 
This will allow us to tell when escape has been hit twice in a row. We'll 
call this location LSTCHR (for last character). 

The general pattern will be to do some brief tests each time a charac- 
ter is input, and, if no conversion is necessary, to pass the upper-case let- 
ter through unaltered. Only when an escape sequence is coming through 
or when we're in the lower-case mode will we ever alter the input 
character. 

Here, then, is the improved listing:

After assembling and installing this routine at $300, try the Apple- 
soft program with the altered line 20 again. This time you should be able 
to enter a string containing both upper-case and lower-case letters, with 
the escape key functioning as described in the requirements list. 

Note the use of EQU to define ESC in line 9. The label ESC is used 
as a value rather than a location. This way you can change the key used 
for shift by changing the value equated in line 9. 

A look at the source listing reveals what's going on. First, a JSR 
KEYIN is done to get a character from the keyboard. KEYIN handles 
the flashing cursor and keyboard hardware for us. Next, the input char- 
acter is -pushed on the stack so we'll be free to use the accumulator if 
necessary without losing the input character. 

Next, a test is done to see if the current character is an escape charac- 
ter. If so, a branch is done to the escape-handling routine, ESCl (line 34). 
The first thing done at ESCl is to see if the last character was an escape 
as well, in which case LOCK (line 38) sets caps lock mode by putting a 
$80 in CSFLG. If not, then CASE2 (line 48) diecks CSFLG to see if we're 
presently in lower or upper case. 

To simplify this test, we've used a value of $00 for CSFLG to signify 
the lower-case mode. A value of $80 signifies the upper-case mode in our 
example. These values were chosen to allow the use of the BIT com- 
mand. Because the BIT instruction conditions the sign flag (bit 7) of the 
status register according to bit 7 of the memory location referenced, we 



can test the status of CSFLG without actually having to load the ac- 
cumulator with anything to do the test. 

CASE2 uses the bit instruction to test bit 7 of CSFLG. If bit 7 is 
clear, we're in lower-case mode and all that needs to be done is to pass 
this first escape character through to XFER, where it will be stored in 
LSTCHR. That way the escape can be used to signify a shift to upper 
case if the next character is a letter. 

If bit 7 is set, then we're in upper case, and we need to "unlock" the 
upper-case mode. UNLOCK does this by putting a 0 value in CSFLG. 
You'll also notice that the current character is changed from an escape to 
a null. This is done so that after down-shifting, we can still press escape 
once more to capitalize the next letter. If we hadn't changed that escape 
to a null when we down-shifted, we'd be back in upper-case locked 
mode. 

For the next pass through, let's see what happens with a nonescape 
character. We'll resume tracing the routine right after ENTRY has de- 
cided that the current character is not an escape character. 

The next section is CHAR, which checks to see whether the last char- 
acter through was an escape character. If so, we need to make sure the 
current letter is capitalized, even though we're presumably in the lower- 
case mode. This is easily done, though; program flow proceeds directly to 
XFER. Remember, XFER simply stores the current input character in 
LSTCHR and then returns to the calling program. In this case, because 
all characters generated by KEYIN are always upper case (except on the 
Apple lie), we'll just leave the capital letter input "as is," and pass it 
through. 

If the last character was not an escape, program flow continues to the 
CASE section, which decides whether to convert the character coming 
through by checking to see whether we're in upper or lowCT-case mode. 

CASE uses the BIT instruction to do this test. If we're in the upper- 
case mode (bit 7 = 1, therefore BMI works), no conversion of the in- 
coming upper-case letter is needed and the program branches directly to 
the XFER routine. XFER retrieves the original input character stored 
on the stack, updates LSTCHR (since this will now be the "last charac- 
ter" on the next pass through), and then returns to the main calling pro- 
gram via the RTS. 

If the CSFLG was set to zero, line 21 would not branch, and the 
CVERT (for convert) routine would be entered. CVERT first retrieves 
the input character from the stack and then checks to see if the character 
has an ASCII value less than that of the letter A. If so, the character 
coming through is a number or a control character, and as such should 
not be converted to lower case. If such a character is detected, the rou- 
tine jumps over the conversion routine to line 27, which puts the charac- 
ter back on the stack (where XFER expects to find it) and goes through 
to the XFER section. 

If the character has an ASCII value equal to or greater than that of 
the letter A, then the ORA #$20 sets bit 5, thus converting the letter to 
lower case. At that point the new character is put on the stack for the 
XFER routine. 

Conclusions. This is definitely one of those programs that take a flow 
chart to design, so don't feel discouraged if everything's not immediately 
clear. Considering all the possible situations of escape sequences and cur- 
rent case, it may take a little time before you feel comfortable with it. 

Even if the program never makes complete sense, remember that the 
important thing here is to understand the workings of the input system in 
general, rather than this particular little routine. 

Of course, the best way to understand what's going on is to experi- 
ment with your own routines. Doing this always helps bring out the right 
and wrong assumptions about the way we think things work. You might 
want to try writing the generalized input routine suggested earlier, or per- 
haps you're one of those people who've hooked up a wire from the shift 
key to push button 2. If so, see if you can improve the input routine to 
allow yourself to use the shift key as well. Another interesting project 
would be to write your own KEYIN routine to be used by the input rou- 
tine, and see if you can generate a different kind of cursor — or solve the 
problem of the cursor not looking quite right when it's on a lower-case 
letter. 

In any event, enjoy whatever it is you do with your Apple; see you 
here next month! -m

END TAX 
TRAU 





We have the perfect way to 
breeze through the most 
dreaded task of the year. 
And you can do it on your 
computer — even if you're a 
complete novice. 

It's called The Tax 
Advantagel" It's fast and 
it's a cinch to use. 

The program takes you 
line-by-line through Form 1040 and the other most 
common tax forms. It asks you for information in plain 
English, and you type in the numbers.That's all there 
is to it. 

The Tax Advantage™ does complex operations like 
income averaging with a few simple commands. Not 
only that, but as tax laws change, you can easily update 
the tax tables for a nominal sum. 

Another terrific feature is that it automatically com- 
putes your taxes with each entry you make. So you 
know exactly how each line affects your overall tax 
picture. 

Pick up The Tax Advan- 
tage!" Simply stated, it's the 
best way to do your taxes. 

But hurry. April's almost 
here. 

The Tax Advantage™ is 
available for the Apple II and 
Atari 400/800. Price $59.95.

T^he reason you bought a 

computer 

in the first nlace. 



T 



he Agony... 

You 
expected 
your new computer 
to perform miracles 
— to bring order out 
of chaos. You lool<ed 
for it to organize and 
manage your business 
information. You lool<ed forward 
to the end of errors, the end of 
frustration . . . and the saving of 
time, effort and money. Afterall, 
that's the reason you invested in 
a computer in the first place. 
Yet, there it sits. Nothing. 

...and the ecstasy. 

Well, your computer can per- 
form all the miracles you hoped 
for. It needs just one profes- 
sional addition. The 
General Manager. 

The General Man- 
ager is what the com- 
puter industry calls a 
data base management 
program (DBM). In 
everyday words — it 
allows you to organize, 
store, file, find, save, re 
treive, interrelate, control 
and print out all orselected parts 
of your information. The result: 
your information, or data, is 
managed totally, completely, 
automatically. 

Ordinary 

The ordinary DBM system 
expects your business to con- 
form to its program design. So 
you must change your records, 
your forms, your way of having 
information cross-referenced, 
saved and . . . well, you almost 
end up with a different business! 
Certainly a more frustrating one. 

Extraordinary 

The General Manager on the 
other hand is extraordinary in 
the DBM field, because it makes 
no such demands on you. In- 
stead, it lets you make demands 
on it! The General Manager was 
designed so that your business 




The General Manager 




routines can be kept as indivi- 
dualized as you want ... so your 
data is managed and de- 
livered in the ways which 
are most useful, effi- 
cient and effective 
for you. 

It works so easily 
and so well because 
of its "hierarchial" 
structure. This sen- 
sible "family tree" 
type of design starts 
with the main subject, then 
branches out to related informa- 
tion. You enter data on "Blank 
Forms" which you may construct 
to your exact needs. The data 
may be updated, deleted or 
modified to 
your heart's 
content. To 
know The 
General Man- 
ager will be to 
love it! 

Power & 
Price 

Nothing 
near the price 
of the General 
Manager (by 
hundreds of 
dollars) gives 
you all the 
power, fea- 
tures and benefits it does! At 
$229.95, The General Manager is 
the absolute value in its field.

Consider this: it supports 1 
to 4 floppy disk drives (even 
hard-disk systems). It includes 
utility programs which others 
charge hundreds extra for. 
Upper and lower case characters 
in the data base are provided 
without need for additional 
costly hardware. If someone 
goofs, the "error message" is 
displayed in understandable 
English. There is an on- 
screen "Help" function 
available any time. It 
creates Applesoft usable 
files for your program 
needs. And many espe- 
cially useful printing 
commands are built-in 
for 

greater flexi- 
bility. When 
you consider 
all these ad- 
vantages, and 
more, we think 
your business 
sense will a- 
gree, there's 
no contest at 
any price. 

The fantasy... 

Almost 
everyone 
claims user 
friendly docu- 
mentation. The fact remains 
much of it is convoluted, com- 
plicated and defies under- 



standing. You can't afford 
that! — for a program 
without excellent 
documentation is 
frustrating and basi- 
cally useless. 

...and reality! 

At Sierra On-Line we've 
spent the time and the effort 
to create superb documentation. 
It is so good that you can have 
The General Manager up and 
running after the first two 
chapters! And after you're 
thoroughly at home with it, you 
can move on to the other 
chapters as you have need for 
the many additional functions 
and capabilities. 

The reason you bought... 

... a computer in the first 
place was, we know, twofold: 
for word processing (our Screen 
Writer program is the leader) . . . 
but mainly for information man- 
agement. The General Manager 
is your powerful 
answer . . . the 
truly outstand- 
ing value in 
DBM's, bar 
none, at only 
$229.95.

Now we get down to some of the nitty-gritty techniques used for 
creating fast animation in arcade games. We covered basic animation 
ideas using shape tables, but they are much too slow and cause too much 
flickering for really professional-looking results. Today we start creating 
some real animation. 

One of the techniques for fast, smooth movement is an invention 
called a preshifted shape. It should be noted from the outset that the term 
preshifted shape has a few different defmitions, depending on who's talk- 
ing about it. It seems that a couple of years ago, when everyone's little in- 
ventions for fast-animation techniques started fikering around, pre- 
shifted shapes was the magic phrase, although definitions didn't always 
accompany the phrase. So when people happened on techniques that 
caused fast animation, many assumed they had discovered the secrets of 
preshifted shapes, even if it wasn't the original technique. It's just as well, 
for now we have that many more approaches to work with. 

Page-flipping was, and is, another magic phrase for smooth anima- 
tion. It's simple to understand: use both hi-res graphics screens, show 
one, erase and redraw on the other, and flip pages. That way you don't 
see the flicker caused by the erase and redraw cycle. Page-flipping, to be 
fast, has to be used along with some form of preshifted shapes, or a simi- 
larly fast animation method. There are, however, ways to achieve the 
smooth results of page-flipping within the structure of preshifted shapes 
without actually flipping pages. 

The first way to think of a preshifted shape is in terms of character 
graphics. Recalling from a few months ago when we did a hi-res text gen- 
erator, a character on-screen is nothing more than a set of bytes with bits 
on or off defining the shape of the character. By putting those bytes into 
screen memory, the shape is displayed. Try typing in and running the 
program in listing 1. It uses characters on the text screen for doing ani- 
mation as we did earlier with shape tables. The same results could be 
achieved on the hi-res screen using the hi-res character generator of a few 
issues back. 

Examine the animation; it is fast, but it's also very jumpy. The char- 
acter moves by large steps rather than small ones, creating the impres- 
sion of something moving under a strobe light instead of normal light- 
ing. A very simple example explains the speed and the jumpiness of this 
type of animation. 



Suppose our shape is one dot. Throwing away the high bit in each 
byte, since it is only a color flag, we have seven bits with which to work, 
and our one-dot shape might be stored as the byte in figure 1. To move 
across the screen, however, it will have to occupy each of the positions 
shown in figure 2. (Figure 2 shows the bit that's set as a dot and those 
that aren't set as blank, which is what happens when they are displayed 
on the screen.)

Note that, when the byte is moved horizontally, our dot shape moves 
seven pixels at a time, rather than a smoother one or two. (Pixel is short 
for picture element, which is a fancy way of saying dot.) Vertical move- 
ment doesn't give us the same problem, since the bytes are only one dot 
tall when stacked on the screen. In other words, you could take figure 2 
and duplicate it immediately below itself and find the dot shapes imme- 
diately above and below each other. Our hi-res text generator would 
work better than the text screen animation in Usting 1 for vertical 
movement. 

How do you get smooth horizontal movement? Two ways. First, you 
could use the assembly language ROL and ROR commands (rotate left 
and rotate right) to put the shape in the correct column before putting 
the byte on-screen. But that isn't very workable, since any shape wider 
than one pixel can overflow across two bytes, depending on exact screen 
position. You also have to worry about keeping the high bit where it is 
when you're ROLing and RORing things around. And worse yet, all 
that takes time, which you don't want to waste when animating. That's 
why the character animation was fast: there was minimal computation 
involved — you simply found the byte and put it on the screen. 

Solution? Preshifted shapes. In other words, do the ROLing and 
RORing first, either by hand or by letting the computer help you. We'll 
do it by hand so you can follow along. Take that one-dot shape, for 
example. We want that dot to be able to appear in any of seven positions in

any byte. Hence, we store seven shapes: preshifted shapes. Take a look at 
figure 3 to see how to get them. Notice that for any dot you want set in 
figure 2, you can find one of the preshifted shapes and store that byte's 
value in screen memory to set that dot. 

Before leaving off we'll do a crude preshifted shape plotter in Basic. 
Note that the program in listing 2 has a byte counter (X) and a bit count- 
er (XB) for the X value. That's because we are interested not only in put- 
ting a byte on the screen, but also in finding the byte value with the prop- 
er bit set. We'll store our table of seven preshifted, one-dot shapes in the 
array S%, so that S%(XB) will have the proper value with the correct bit 
set for any of seven dot positions. Note that we didn't put an erase rou- 
tine into the program, so our dot shape leaves a trail — most of the time. 

The program in listing 2, and the one in listing 5 as well, uses two files 
we generated in November's Graphically Speaking, named Plot and 
Lookup. For those of you who've joined us since then, we'll rq)rint them just 
this once. Listing 3 generates the lookup table in memory. Run the 
program and save the table to disk using the command: 

BSAVE LOOKUP, A16384, L384 

Listing 4 is a quick way that anybody can type in the machine lan- 
guage plot routine. Save it to disk with the command: 

BSAVE PLOT,A24576,L23 

Next time we'll do larger animated shapes and a machine language 
routine to put them on-screen and we'll look at a tricky technique for 
eliminating the erase cycle. The really clever ones among you might find 
the secret to that trick in the way the program in listing 2 works. Or 
perhaps listing 5, a variation on listing 2, will give you a clue.

IF YOITRE CONFUSED 
PERSONAL COMPUTER, 



At this moment, there are no 
less than 50 personal computers 
on the market. And more are 
being introduced every day. 

On one hand, having all those 
options is a good thing. On the 
other, it can make picking the 
right one pretty difficult. 



f«>.fj«ifiiiiii i.iiii iiiii ,\ 




Computers come in two parts. 
You have to buy both. 



We'd like to help. So here are a 
few suggestions about how to buy 
the computer that's right for you. 
Computers come in two parts. 

One part is the "hardware," 
which is the machinery itseK. The 
other is the "software," or a pro- 
gram, as it's sometimes called. 

Software is the part that tells 
the computer what to do, the way 
a driver tells a car what to do. 

Without software, a computer 
can't do anything. 

And vice versa. 

You have to buy both. 
Buy the software first. 

Since the reason you're buying 
a computer is to get the capability 
the software gives you (remember, 
it's the software that knows how 
to get things done), it makes 
good sense to pick the 
software fEst. 



Start by making a list of the 
things you want to use the com- 
puter for. It can include almost 
anything-any kind of inventory, 
fning, accounting, graphics, 
reporting, record-keeping, 
analysis -you name it and there's 
probably a software program that 
does it. 

Next, take the list into a com- 
puter store and ask the salesper- 
son to give you a demonstration 
of the program, or programs, 
that will do the things you 
want. 

Even though you'll 
need a computer 
for the soft 
demonstTc 



tion, keep in mind the computer 
is just a vehicle. The software is 
the driver. And once you've 
decided on the software, picking 
out the rest of the computer sys- 
tem wQl be much easier. 
The simpler the better. 

Look for software that's easy to 
learn, easy to use, and that does 
the job in the simplest way 
possible. 

Good personal soft- 
ware should be, as the 
computer people say 
friendly." Meaning 
that it helps you 
do what you 
have to do 
without get- 
ting in the 
way. 





Mean- 
ing there 
are no com- 
plicated routines 
to foUow to perform 
a simple task. And no 
programming 
language to learn. 
Some people, how- 
ever, win tell you that soft- 
ware has to be compli- 
cated to be powerful. 

Nothing could be far- 
ther from the truth. 
Because in order for a 
program to appear simple 
to you on the outside, it has to 
be extremely complex on 
the mside. 



ABOUT BUYINGA 
HERE'S SOME HELR 



Good software keeps the com- 
plications in the computer, where 
they belong. And keeps the capa- 
bility at your fingertips, It's that 
simple. 

You simply have to see 
for yourself. 

You can read any number of 
interesting books and magazines 
about personal computers. You 
can ask friends who have them, 
You can look at all the sales litera- 
ture you can get your hands on. 
And you should do all those 
things before you decide to buy 

But as helpful as all that can be, 
there really is no substitute for a 
real, live demonstration. 

When you do go out shopping, 
we recommend you take a look at 
the PFS® Family of Software. 

The PFS family is designed the 
way we think all software should 
be: simple, straightforward and 
powerful. 

Currently three products 
make up the family PFS:FILE, 
PFS:REPORT and PFS;GRAPH, 
with more programs on the way 
Here's a little more about each 
of them. 

PFSiFILE. The simplest way 
to get organized. 

Basically FILE works like a 
paper filing system, without the 
paper. So you can record, file, 
retrieve and review information in 
a fraction of the time it takes with 
a conventional filing system. 

FILE lets you arrange your 
information in "forms" you design 
yourself. So you can get at and 
really use your information in ^ - <. ^ 
ways never before possible. ^ 

What's more, FILE lets you ' 
change the original form without I 
having to redo the information on it. ' 



PFS:R£PORT. Making the most 
of your information. 

REPORT summarizes the 
information on your forms so you 
can use it to analyze, plan and 
make better-informed decisions. 
With REPORT, you get presen- 
tation-quality reports- sorted, cal- 
culated, formatted and printed- 
automatically in seconds. 
PFS:GRAPH. Instant pictures. 

GRAPH gives you presentation 
quality bar charts, line graphs, 
and pie charts, in black and white 
or color, on paper or the com- 
puter screen. To get a clearer 
picture of things and spot trends 
instantly you simply enter your 
information and specify the kind 
of graph or chart you want, 
GRAPH does the rest. 

You can also mix and match 
line and bar graphs, or even stack 
or compare up to four bar graphs 
simultaneously. 

And GRAPH will work with 
PFS:FILE, VisiCalc® fHes, or data 
entered directly into the 
computer 

Best of all, compared to the 
cost of hand-drawn graphics, 
GRAPH can save you enough 
money over the course of a few 
months to pay for the computer it 
runs on.

Load a language card with Applesoft in four seconds. Load a hi-res 
graphic in three seconds. Save a sixty-six-sector Basic program in five 
seconds — a task that usually takes your Apple more than four times 
that long. 

Do it without RAM cards or hard disks. All you need is the stan- 
dard Apple DOS and some special subroutines (available in several ver- 
sions for less than $30) that get DOS to jump over candlesticks. 

In the April 1982 Softalk, Don Worth and Pieter Lechner suggested a 
way to make DOS work faster. Their method involves changing the way 
your disks are skewed. 

What's that mean? When you initialize a disk, magnetic patterns 
divide it into thirty-five circles lying inside each other (tracks). Each track 
is further broken into sixteen sectors. 

If the sectors were numbered sequentially (1, 2, 3, 4, and so on), there 
would be no skew. But if you look very closely through the oblong hole 
on one of vour disks, you will see the actual pattern is 1,9, 2, 10. . . . 

Think of it this way. In front of you is a merry-go-round with sixteen 
horses. Walk up to it and tape a 1 to your favorite. Then start walking 
around the merry-go-round, taping the numbers 2 through 8 on every 
other horse. When you're ready to mark horse 9, you will find yourself in 
front of horse 1. So skip him, and make the next horse 9. Continue on 
around until you have them all numbered. 

You now have a reasonable facsimile of a track on an Apple DOS 
disk. It is not exact, since your Apple's sectors are actually numbered 0 
through 15, in binary, backwards, with two sectors between 0 and 1 and 
between 14 and 15, but it will do for us carbon-based creatures. 

In their article. Worth and Lechner pointed out that Apple DOS 
wastes a lot of time waiting for the next sector it needs to come by. Start 
your merry-go-round spinning. We are going to load a file called 
Peanuts. When the kid on horse 1 comes by, he's going to hand you a 
bag of peanuts. Grab it. While the horse next to 1 (horse 9) goes by, put 
the bag in a cardboard box on the ground. Then reach up and grab the 
bag from the kid on horse 2. You will quickly appreciate why disks are 
skewed — it gives you time to put the peanuts in the box. 

The problem with poor Uncle DOS is that he can't move as fast as 
we can imagine. By the time he gets our peanuts into memory, the kid on 
horse 2 has already gone by. In fact. Worth and Lechner say, the kids on 



horses 3, 4, and 5 have gone by, too. Uncle DOS then has to stand and 
wait for a relatively long time (for a silicon-based creature), until the kid 
on horse 2 comes around the bend again. 

No less than eighteen kids pass Uncle DOS for each bag of peanuts 
he gets. If your disk drive is well adjusted, it spins at 300 revolutions per 
minute (about eighty sectors per second — much too fast for a merry-go- 
round, incidentally). So Uncle DOS spends 3.6 seconds just getting six- 
teen bags of peanuts off the merry-go-round. Since our good uncle is not 
really quick on his feet, either, the total time for loading or saving Pea- 
nuts is somewhat longer. 

Worth and Lechner suggest that we can get a better response time 
from our disks if we reskew them. In other words, since Uncle DOS 
spends so much time standing around waiting for the next kid he needs 
to come by, why not rearrange the way the kids sit on the merry-go- 
round? Doing this intelligently, we could fix it so that when Uncle DOS 
was ready for another bag of peanuts the very next horse to show up 
would be the one he was looking for. 

Worth and Lechner wrote a program that does this. It lifts that which 
is on each track of your disk — horses, numbers, kids, peanuts, and so 
on — rearranges it, and puts it back down. In the process, it actually re- 
initializes each track with the new sector skew. In the new arrangement, 
only nine sectors go by for each one loaded. Uncle DOS works much 
more efficiently and, in some cases, almost twice as fast. 

But the solution is not perfect. As Worth later pointed out in the 
August Softalk (Open Discussion), a problem arises when Uncle DOS is 
resaving an old file. In this case, the new skew actually lengthens the time 
it takes to save the file. If the file is a brand-new one, however, the prob- 
lem doesn't occur. 

So we want more speed from Uncle DOS and we have a lot of re- 
spect for Worth and Lechner (they are the Matthew, Mark, Luke, and 
John of this branch of human knowledge — they wrote Beneath Apple 
DOS). But we are left with having to redo all our disks (shades of 
Muffin); longer saves on preexisting files; and nagging questions about 
what old Uncle DOS is doing while all those sectors pass by. It's quite a 
long time for a silicon-based creature, after all. 

Rub-a-Dub-Dub— Three Men in a Tub. When you get old Uncle 
DOS up on the examining table and take a good look at him, you find

out (holy chips!) that he's really three separate people. 

The first of these three is the one who talks to us. We send him 
messages like catalof, and he responds with messages like syntax error. 
He doesn't have a common name in the Apple literature, but in data- 
processing circles he is known as a "command interpreter." Since many 
of us are allergic to data-processing circles, let's just call him "captain." 

Our new friend the captain is part spy. This guy actually reroutes all 
your incoming and outgoing keystrokes and messages; so he gets to see 
them first. If he detects something that looks like it's for him, he tries to 
act on it. There are a few things he can handle on his own, such as mon, 
maxfiles, pr§, and in§. But, in general, the captain doesn't do dirty work. 
In particular, he stays as far away from your disk drive as possible. 
Whenever he sees a command requiring the accessing of the disk, he fills 
out a form known as the file manager parameter list and gives the file 
manager a call. 

The file manager is the second person of the DOS trinity. He's a 
sweet old guy, kind of slow but ultraorganized. There's a good picture of 
him on page 6-9 of Beneath Apple DOS. It's the file manager who keeps 
track of what's on your disks and where. He reserves space on each disk 
that he uses to write himself messages. These remind him what he stored 
where. But not even the file manager can actually turn on your disk 
drive. What he can do is write some numbers on the input/output black- 
board (lOB) and give a call to Mr. RWTS. 

Mr. RWTS, the third part of DOS, is not really a "person." He may 
be a robot. His features are very chiplike. We humans don't even know 
how to pronounce his name correctly. What we do know is that if we fill 
out the input/output blackboard with the right numbers and call him, he 
then, through a miracle of timing loops, nibblizers, and stepper motor 
phases, can actually turn a disk drive on; move the arm inside it to the 
track we want; and read, write, or initialize sectors. Amazing. 

The input/output blackboard has spaces for several interesting and 
several rather ordinary numbers. The interesting ones are the track and 
sector that Mr. RWTS will read from or write to, and a memory ad- 
dress. This address tells Mr. RWTS where to put the bag of peanuts if he

is reading a disk, or where to get it if he is writing. An important limita- 
tion of Mr. RWTS is that he doesn't deal with single peanuts. He only 
deals with bags of peanuts, and each bag has to have exactly 256 bytes, 
er, peanuts, in it. These robots are so demanding. 

If you leave the Uncle DOS trio up on the examining table and watch 
them do their stuff, you will be amazed by how many numbers they 
move around just, for instance, to load a file called Lollipops. And if you 
watch them very closely you'll see that the file manager needs to take a 
seminar in time management and delegation. In the interests of order 
and organization, the old fool moves so many irrelevant numbers around 
that it makes your head spin. 

So what is the file manager doing while the next sector he needs (as 
well as several more) pass by? Lots of things. One of the most time-con- 
suming is moving the bags of peanuts he gets to where they belong in 
memory. The file manager always tells Mr. RWTS to put the bags in a 
box called the data buffer. Then he moves them, peanut by peanut, to 
where they belong. By the time he's finished and has filled in the 
input/output blackboard for the next sector he needs, Mr. RWTS finds 
it long gone. 

There are certain times when using the data buffer is absolutely 
necessary, such as when you're dealing with a text file, or when you 
want only part of a bag of peanuts. 

If Lollipops was only 56 bytes long, for example, and Mr. RWTS put 
its data sector directly into memory, not only would you get the 56 bytes 
you wanted, but you would also get 200 extra bytes that would over- 
write your program or data and thus destroy them. 

On the other hand, there are times when sifting everything through 
the data buffer is foolish. If you're loading a hi-res graphic, for example, 
thirty of its thirty-two sectors can be placed in their final positions in 
memory by Mr. RWTS. 

If we teach the file manager to let Mr. RWTS put the peanuts di- 
rectly into memory, astounding things happen. We catch the next sector 
when it passes! Suddenly, only two sectors are passing by for each one we 
read — not eighteen, not nine. We can read or write the sixteen sectors on 
an entire track in 0.4 seconds, not 3.6 seconds. This is nine times faster! 

Since a lot more goes on when you read or write a file than the actual 
transfer of data between the disk and memory, the total speed increase is 
less than 900 percent. But 300 to 400 percent faster is easy. Thumb-twid- 
dling, carbon-based creatures find the difference significant and very 
pleasurable. 

One of the advantages we mortals have over silcon-based creatures 
such as the file manager is that we can change their DNA easier than 
they can change ours (as of this time). Several people have figured out 
new sequences of DNA that can be spliced into the file manager. These 
fix the little man's reluctance to delegate things to Mr. RWTS. They're 
available in programs from at least five different publishers. If you like 
the excitement of typing in your own DNA sequences, look at the pro- 
gram called Oiler in Nibble, volume 3, number 5. 

These programs are similar but do have different features you will 
want to consider if you think this kind of speed is for you. Some will load 
files at high speed, but not save. Some don't work on extremely long files. 
Some copy-protect the DOS on your disks, thus making special copy 
programs necessary for backup. Some delete an automatic verify that the 
captain normally orders after each save, slightly increasing the risk of file 
tragedy. Each program scrambles the inner workings of DOS to various 
degrees; if you use programs that peek and poke standard DOS locations, 
you may find things have been moved. Each needs extra memory space; 
some get it by deleting the init command and using its territory, some by 
turning your error messages into numbers, some by using the empty 
spaces within DOS. The best program for you will depend on your 
needs. 

A final point to consider. The speed increases will apply to binary, 
Applesoft, and Integer Basic files. Text files are a breed that has to be 
handled one byte at a time. Text file bytes are passed to an input routine 
(or come from a print routine) rather than being associated with a fixed 
place in memory. This makes text files naturally slow and not applicable 
to speed-up by this technique. Jl

The Schoolhouse Apple 




What's a computer center like and what do you learn there? Young 
people who've spent some time at the Farrell Area School District's Mi- 
crocomputer Center in Farrell, Pennsylvania, can give you some idea. 
Their descriptions and comments follow. 

As Brian Clarke puts it, when you visit the computer center, you dis- 
cover "how much fun working with a computer really is." Farrell's Mi- 
crocomputer Center is managed by Donna DeBonis, computer instruc- 
tor/coordinator for the Farrell school district. Quoting from an article 
that appeared in a parent's night program, Becky Harkless explains that 
"computer awareness and programming are being taught in grades K 
through 12. The students are learning how to operate the computers and 
to use the software." 

The students seem to agree with Eric Savage's opinion of their teach- 
er "One more thing I have to tell you — Miss DeBonis is great!" "She is 
always there when we need her," adds Hattie McLean. 

Regina Caputo and others highlight the role David Joseph, the for- 
mer academic administrative coordinator, played in the origination of 
Farrell's center. It was he who was responsible for writing the proposal 
resulting in the purchase of Farrell's first computers. The computers are 
maintained by George Pedas, the audio-visual coordinator. 

Pam McKethan describes the room that houses Farrell Middle 
School's Apples. "When you walk in the room, you see four tables that 
have three or four computers on them. On the walls are nice pictures that 
give you a little advice." Lance Messett quotes the motto displayed on a 
bulletin board: "The secret of success is to look upon each problem as a 
challenge." 

Paul Samuels and others tell more about the particulars of Farrell's 
Microcomputer Center. "We have thirteen computers in the center; we 
have one in each elementary school and one in industrial arts. We also 
have four in the high school and one in each administrative office." Far- 
rell Middle School also has six printers. 

As Nicholas Scarmack explains, "The setup includes a teacher who is 
here from 7:45 to 4:30 to help anybody who wants to learn about data 
processing. The resources we use are books on how to use the comput- 
ers, magazines about different computers, and the many different soft- 
ware programs computers use." 

To begin with, you learn "how to put the disk in, how to turn on the 
machine, and how to type on the machine," explains Mary Lou Jack- 
son. And you're taught early on that you must "handle the disk with gen- 
tleness." 

Rosiland Brown likes the various experiences she's had at the cen- 
ter — "Especially when we opened the computer. Inside the computer 
were the integrated circuits, the small speaker, and the RAM and ROM 
memory." Cecilia Chapman also enjoyed the lesson: "In the center I 
have learned things about the computer I never knew. I've learned about 
the parts inside the machine — chips that run the computer, the inte- 
grated circuits known as ICs or chips. ICs store the information." 

Lenora Grande explains some of the computer's internals: "There 
are two types of computer memory, RAM and ROM. RAM stores the 
data that I enter into the computer, while ROM stores the computer's 
language." 

According to Leonae J. Evans, different groups of students "come to 
learn different subjects on the computers. The high school students come 
to the computer center mainly to write different reports and learn the 
ways of computer input." In addition, students from the high school 
come to the center to help the middle schoolers learn to operate the ma- 
chines, according to Vicki Davis and Terry Kromka. 

"The seventh-graders come to learn math on computers," continues 



Evans. "Different groups of eighth-graders come to the computer center 
for computer-awareness sessions." Michele Lee is one such eighth- 
grader. She enjoys doing word processing using a text editor and learn- 
ing how to edit. 

Dave Chec tells about students who come to the center in their free 
time to write their own programs, and about those who work on the 
school newspaper {The Inkspot), using Apple Writer and the printer. 
Dave and Ron Dorogy both mention a disk from MECC, which con- 
tains learning games such as Nomad, Sumeria, and Oregon Trail, as an 
example of the commercial programs students can enjoy when they come 
to the center after school. 

Buddy Mackin points out that "the computer center also has classes 
for older people wanting to learn about computers." As Lenora White 
explains, "Grown people learn just about the same parts of computer 
awareness as we students do." 

"Students and parents at the center work together to help each other 
become computer-literate," says Lena Mayes. In fact, reports Damon 
Avery, there's a special class for parents. Introduction to the Apple Com- 
puter; it was recently added to the Farrell Adult Continuing Education 
Program. 

"Teachers also learn to work with the computers," says Mary Anne 
Heckathorn, using them to write programs for their classes. Margo Ray 
explains how some students became teachers. "Some of the students 
were so good that they were able to teach administrators, secretaries, and 
teachers, and they weren't all from our school district. So, you can see 
that the Farrell Microcomputer Center is helpful to many different peo- 
ple in many different ways," concludes Ray. 

Alicia Hilton is enthusiastic about Farrell's center. "I like it because I 
learn something every day, mostly about things I've never seen before. 
Once you keep on going, you get the hang of it." Says Nikki Jaggers: 
"When you leave the computer center, I guarantee that you will know 
something." 

Diane Kagle expresses a common sentiment when she says, "It's just 
a shame that we don't have more computers to work with." Amy Linonis 
agrees, adding, "I think everyone should have a chance to work on a 
computer, no matter what their age. If all the schools would get a com- 
puter, the students would enjoy and benefit from coming to work on 
them — computers are the way of the future." 

Many thanks to all the Farrell Microcomputer Center correspon- 
dents who shared their experiences and perspectives. More on computer 
centers in a future column. 

There's a Contest Under Way. It's the Computer EdGame Chal- 
lenge, sponsored by Verbatim Corporation (the folks who make floppy 
disks) and administered by Conduit and MicroSIFT. Contest organizers 
are looking for "imaginative instructional software" that's nonviolent 
and fun. You'll have to work fast — the contest opened in January and 
closes on the thirty-first of March. 

The contest has three divisions — elementary, secondary, and post- 
secondary — and can be entered by students, teachers, and professionals. 
The authors of the best educational games in each of twenty subject areas 
will be awarded $500 Computerland gift certificates. Three additional 
gift certificates will be awarded for the best student entry overall in the 
elementary, secondary, and postsecondary categories. The two best en- 
tries in the elementary/secondary and postsecondary divisions will re- 
ceive IBM Personal Computers. 

Entrants receive pointers and information about how to create a 
game that is both educafional and fun. They're reminded that an educa-

edge and that, in order for this to happen, the game's scoring must be 
carefully linked to the game's "educational intent." Otherwise, it's very 
possible that players will become really good at the game without having 
mastered anything but a game strategy that enables them to rack up high 
scores. It's also recommended that entrants concern themselves with clar- 
ity of visual presentation and instructions, effective error-trapping, and 
helpful help options. Commercial software producers would do well to 
keep these guidelines in mind. 

Contest entry forms can be obtained at participating Computerlands 
or by calling 800-221-4052 (in Oregon 248-6800). You'll receive informa- 
tion about contest rules, categories, and judging criteria, as well as some 
helpful guidelines for writing game software. A special packet is available 
to teachers who'd like to make a class project out of this event. 

The games submitted become the property of the contest organizers. 
The best of them will be put on disk and distributed to educators on a 
nonprofit basis. Game authors will receive royalties. 

A Word about Software. Let's look now at a program intended to 
help young people become more knowledgeable about words. 

Word Attack! By JaniceG. Davidson, Ph.D., and Richard K. Edcert, Jr. 
At a time when too much of the drill and practice software available is of 
questionable value, Davidson and Associates's Word Attack! comes as a 
welcome surprise. This well-conceived, well-executed drill and practice 
program for building vocabulary serves as a much-needed reminder that 
the phrase drill and practice need not be synonymous with dull and 
deadly. 

The purpose of the program is to help people in grades four through 
twelve increase their vocabularies. As the authors explain at the begin- 
ning of the documentation, Word Attack! is not meant to be students' 
only vocabulary-building tool, particularly since it does not teach pro- 
nunciation or the multiple meanings of words. What the program is 
meant to do is help students learn to recognize, define, and become com- 
fortable with new words. 

The main learning process consists of three activities (each of which 
builds on the last) supplemented by a final — and fun — reinforcement ac- 
tivity. The program has nine levels of difficulty, each containing seventy- 
five words, divided into twenty-five-word groups of adjectives, nouns, 
and verbs. 

First, each word in a given list is displayed on-screen, along with a 
synonym or brief definition and a sentence in which it is used correctly. 
Users are encouraged to run through this exercise until they have the 
words and their meanings firmly in mind. 

Next comes a multiple-choice quiz that can be set up two ways. In 
normal mode, the word is given and the correct meaning must be select- 
ed; in reverse mode, a meaning is given and the correct word must be 
chosen to go with it. 

In the sentence-completion section, learners are asked to supply the 
missing word in the sentence. It will be one of the twenty-five words un- 
der study. 

When learners are convinced they know all twenty-five words in a 
list, they can test that assumption by playing Word Attack!, the enter- 
taining arcade-like game for which the package is named. Four words 
and one definition appear on the screen and the player must find and 
shoot down the correct one before time runs out. The game has three dif- 
ferent speeds and is an effective and painless way of using and reinforc- 
ing new knowledge. Some kids will want to start out here, rather than 
progress through the first three learning exercises; that's fine. It will soon 
become clear that doing really well at the game hinges on knowing the 
meanings of the words. 

The program is still useful after the words on the disk or on a given 
level have been mastered. Supplementary data disks, containing 500 
words apiece and designed for learners at various grade levels, are avail- 
able from Davidson and Associates for $19.95. In addition, teachers, 
parents, and older kids can create learning materials of their own by 
using the editor function of the program and storing the results on an ini- 
tialized data disk. 

The inclusion of the editor program does much to ensure that Word 
Attack! will continue to be used by various members of a family or stu- 
dents in a class. A clearly written chapter in the documentation provides 



a step-by-step explanation of how to use this useful tool. It also identi- 
fies the editor's limits — words can have a maximum of thirteen letters, 
meanings a maximum of thirty-six letters and spaces, and sentences a 
maximum of 120 letters and spaces. 

The program documentation is suitably brief, easy to read, and at- 
tractively presented. Alphabetized word lists and definitions for each of 
the nine levels are provided at the back of the book.

LOGO

Logo is often thought of as a graphics language for children, but it 
can be a lot more than that. It's not terribly fast, but it has a beautiful 
logic that suggests all sorts of application possibilities. Indeed, Logo's list 
processing commands can open up a whole new realm of interactive lan- 
guage arts programs.

This question and answer program is a simplistic first step toward the 
use of Apple Logo's list processing capabilities. An exercise of this type 
can be thought of as a first step toward word processing in Logo. 

In the Q&A procedure, the response to each question is taken as an 
input, A, B, C, or D. These responses are then placed within the text us- 
ing the TYPE command. TYPE differs from PRINT in that it does not 
automatically trigger a carriage return. The carriage return, CHAR 13, 
has to be inserted in the procedure. 

Another thing to note in this Q&A procedure is the fact that the quo- 
tation marks, followed by backslashes, don't appear to be performing 
any function. This combination of characters represents a space. A space 
is entered by hitting the quotation mark, followed by control-Q and two 
spaces. Without these space characters, the words would run together. 
(You'll notice, however, that if you print out this procedure the back- 
slashes won't show up.) 

Let's Argue. It's time now to explore a little further the list process- 
ing capabilities of Apple Logo. Why not follow along with the ARGUE 
procedure? 

The actual sequence of procedures is: 

ARGUE 
ARGUE1 

respond:s 
learn :word 
opposit.phrase :it 
opposit.it 

Once you've entered the procedure ARGUE, you'll be instructed to 
enter a sequence beginning with, "I like " or "I hate ." The next line 
is TYPE, followed by two spaces — in essence, a two-space tab. For ex- 
ample, if you say that you like Logo, the computer will respond, "I hate 
Logo." If you enter a word to which the computer has no response, it 
will ask for the opposite, as was the case with peaches. 

Now here's the procedure, followed by a sample screen display:

Free Enterprise 

A business management game 

You run your own company making decisions based 
on economic factors and the actions of competitors. 

It's your opportunity to sit on top and run a corporation. 
Free Enterprise, based on an IBM-developed simulation 
for training top-level managers, is as surprising and 
demanding as the real world. 

It lets you face the same on-your-toes challenges you 
would in running a real business: pricing products, 
determining budgets for advertising, production, plant 
improvement, and R&D. Even securing bank loans and 
deciding on stockholder dividends. You use computer 
generated reports to make decisions. But if you're wrong 
you could go bankrupt. Only the shrewd survive! 

Free Enterprise can be played at three competency levels 
so novices can compete with the more experienced, and 
from one to six can play. It's the perfect chance to learn 
about the free enterprise system — to practice business 
strategies — and to enjoy it — with no risks. 

Simulation components: disk, user's manual, pad of 50 
record sheets, and pad of 50 decision sheets. 

To obtain Free Enterprise, see your local dealer or 
send in the order form below.

Breakthroughs occur once in a great while, vyhen a 
product emerges that goes beyond imagination. It 
defines new territory. If that product is a computer 
simulation, it will leave the crowded field of carbon- 
copy Space Invaders far behind. 



Rendezvous ... the breakthrough is here. 
Rendezvous accuratelv simulates the orbital 

iligliLfilAjpa<;e shuttle traft. During the 
liftoff and orbital rendezvous stages, exact 
systems of ballistics and orbital mechanics 
require you to master Earth's gravitational 
force. Once you achieve orbit, the 
disorientation of a frictionless, 
zero-gravity environment 
complicates your maneuvers. 
Throughout the final stages of 
alignment and docking, you will 
view the rotating, 3-dimensional 
space station as it would 
appear in a space craft's 
anterior window. 



From liftoff to docking. Rendezvous tests the limits 
of your technical understanding, mathematical 
judgment, and raw perceptual skill. 

Today. Rendezvous is an Interactive Simulation . . . 

tomorrow it will be reality .

Rendezvous is the brainchild of Wes 
Huntress, author of Sub Logic's Saturn

Let's take a tour of the procedure itself. When you enter ARGUE, 
the instructions are listed, a line is skipped, and the cursor indents two 
spaces. When you enter a response, the computer reads the response and 
calls the RESPOND procedure— RESPOND RL (ReadList). 

The first line of the RESPOND procedure inquires as to whether or 
not the predicate "S" is empty. If it's not, the next line instructs you to ig- 
nore the first two words and make the third one "S." 

There's no designation for second, third, fourth, or other elements of 
a list. You can, however, get the procedure to skip over objects by speci- 
fying BUTFIRST. In this case, when you enter, "I like Logo," the sec- 
ond line of the procedure goes to work. First the procedure reads the en- 
tire line except for (BUT) the FIRST word, /. It then reads the sentence 
again, all BUT what is now the FIRST word, like. 

The conditional statements in the next two lines set up the response. 
Ulike is the FIRST word after all BUT the FIRST word is printed, or if 
like is the second word in the sentence, then the sentence is printed. IT 
has already been established as the variable "S." 

The next line calls up the LEARN procedure. If the name of the 
word is already stored away, then LEARN stops and reverts back to 
RESPOND. If not, it proceeds on. The next three lines ask for the op- 
posite of the word input in RESPOND. This is then filed away. 

Now comes the challenging part. 

You've had a taste of list processing; now can you follow the rest of 
the procedure? What happens in OPPOSIT.PHRASE :L and 
OPPOSIT :IT? 

Put this article in front of you and enter the complete ARGUE pro- 
cedure into the Apple. Try working through it one procedure at a time, 
reading the error messages and attempting to interpret their impact on 
the final procedure. You'll probably also want to try variations of the 
procedure; that's one way of discovering for yourself the power of list 
processing with Logo.

ross Llues: 
The unique word 
challenge game. 

It offers intellectual stimulation arcade games can't 
match . . . with all the excitement. 

Fast-action fun isn't just for mystery or arcade games any 
more. Cross Clues is a word game that tests more than 
mere reflexes. It's the mind-challenging evolution of the 
crossword puzzle, with beat-the-clock excitement. The 
playing tempo is lively, but you decide how fast you want 
to go. The computer "umpires" while you compete with 
another player for hidden words, coaxing clues from the 
computer. Since a clue helps your opponent too, suspense 
builds till the end, when the best combination of skill, 
intellect, timing and luck wins. 

If you're ready for an even greater challenge, try 
Concentration Crosswords™ a game that offers 3 levels 
of difficulty and 3 ways to play — for even the most 
demanding word whiz. Again, you compete against the 
clock to uncover hidden words. But once discovered, they 
disappear, to test your memory. Here, a combination of 
word skills, intellect, memoi"v and luck determine the 
winner. 

Both games offer 50 mind-boggling puzzles that appeal 
to young teens through adults. Tiy them both! You may 
find you've matched wits with monsters and space critters 
long enough.

It finally happened. 

Meet the Apple He, an 
impressive new version of a 
most impressive machine. 

The "e" means enhanced. 
Which means a bundle of new 
features: 

A standard memory of 64K 
(versus 48K) that's easily 



expandable. So you can create 
fatter files and crunch larger 
numbers of numbers. 

A new, improved keyboard, 
with a complete set of ASCII 
standard characters. Plus full 
cursor controls, programmable 
function keys, and a rapid 
auto-repeat feature built into 
every key on the board. 

Both upper and lower case 



characters. (And if you want 
to see more of them on the 
screen at one time, a low cost 
80-column text card is available.) 

Improved peripheral ports. 
Which make it a lot easier to 
connect and disconnect game 
controllers, printers and all 
those other wonderful things 
that go with an Apple Personal 
Computer. 



Except for the font,

Self-diagnostics. That's a 
special feature that makes it 
easy to give your computer a 
thorough check-up. 

Plus an even more reliable 
design. Achieved by reducing 
the number of components— 
which is to say, the number of 
things that could go wrong. 



And bear in mind, the lie 
still has all those other virtues 
that made the Apple 11 so very

Above: Saul Bernstein poses with a portion of the opening credits to his Emmy and West award-winning educational 
television show Needlecraft. Right: Einstein assumes his place among the other wonders of the universe. 





BV HOWARD A. SHORE 

The striking imagery of computer art is changing the way we look at 
the world by presenting us with detailed pictures of things only imagined. 

At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, graphic 
simulations of spacecraft in flight give us fantastic visions of things never 
before seen. 

The motion picture Tron features a fantasy world in a computer peo- 
pled by anthropomorphized programs, a world where three-dimen- 
sional solids may mutate at will and massive multistoried conveyances 
defy gravity effortlessly. It is a magical world, created primarily by the 
computer artist. 

But are these imaginings, these visions, truly art forms? Or are they, 
as .some say, merely visual manifestations of our technological abilities, 
like the photographs taken while using an electron microscope? 



From Computer Mozart to the Tube. Saul Bernstein is one of the 
leading authorities on microcomputer painting and computer/video 
interfacing. Famous in computer circles for his Einstein, Chaplin, and 
Mozart computer paintings on the Apple, Bernstein has earned even 
greater acclaim in the vast world of television, winning the prodigious 
West award for excellence in educational broadcasting as well as the 
coveted Emmy. 

A professor of classical art at California State University at North- 
ridge for the past twenty-two years, Bernstein seems eminently qualified 
to determine whether computer art is art — or the work of deranged com- 
puter programmers whose brains have mutated from overexposure to 
videowaves. 

In his large ranch home nestled in the hills of rural Thousand Oaks, 
California, Bernstein has an assortment of tables, desks, and non- 
descript surfaces covered with photographic and electronic equipment, 
video cameras and recorders, monitors, printers, plotters, and graphics 
tablets. 



Pictures, papers, printouts, slides, and other transparencies cover 
every surface, arranged in organized chaos. Huge bookcases filled with 
hundreds of record albums, tapes, and books decorate the opposite wall. 
Monitors are attached to a studio-quality three-quarter-inch Sony video 
recorder, as well as to an InteUigence Graphics System computer and an 
Apple III. The newest arrival, a Hewlett-Packard 2700 model computer, 
still sits in its box, awaiting a place amid the wires and equipment. 

Relegated to the far end of the studio, tucked away in organizing 
bins, is a generous assortment of oil paints and supplies. Along the near 
wall hang ribbons and awards for Bernstein's oil paintings, none of 
which is in sight. It's obvious that he is as comfortable with twentieth- 
century technology as he is with seventeenth-century classical art. 

"I've always loved art. I can remember as a child coloring used paper 
bags or anything I could get my hands on," Bernstein recounts. 

"Cecil B. DeMille inspired me when I was young. If I had had the 
money to buy a movie camera at the time, I might have ended up mak- 
ing motion pictures. Painting was my way of answering him." 



It wasn't until Christmas of 1978, when Bernstein first caught sight of 
the color bars on the Apple II, that he decided he had to own one. He 
landed his first computer job the following March, when Datasoft asked 
him to do the illustrations for Micro Painter. 

His computer illustrations attracted the attention of programmer 
Rod Mansfield, who helped teach Bernstein some basic programming 
techniques. 

"It took me nearly three months on my own just to learn how to load 
and save files," he recalls. "I couldn't learn from the manuals." Bern- 
stein pauses, gazing comfortably about the studio full of his work and 
work tools. "None of this would have been possible without the support 
and belief of the people at Apple. They were brilliant. Mike Markkula 
took a chance and bent over backwards to help me. He invited me to the 
National Computer Convention and used my Einstein illustration to 
help advertise Apple graphics. Bruce Hodge and Charlie Kellner, both 
highly skilled Apple programmers, helped develop much of the graphics 
software I needed." 





A Human Test Station. During the ensuing four years, Bernstein be- 
came a test station of sorts for software and hardware packages. "I've 
had an awflil lot of fun. People send me programs from all over the 
world. I've traded my work for some of theirs." 

Speaking of some of the other programmers who have helped him in 
his work, Bernstein cites Vern Bauman, who developed the software for 
an educational game for him, and Eric Popejoy, who designed much of 
the excellent special effects software, the dissolves and wipes, for 
Bernstein. 

Bernstein has set up the Sony 
with a videotape of some of his 
work. Flames of color leap across 
the screen. "Watch this fill pro- 
gram. Bob Bishop did it. It's an ero- 
sion program; it finds out its own 
color and erodes the picture. Bob 
Bishop's probably the best pro- 
grammer I've ever met." 

The screen metamorphoses to 
reveal a computer illustration of a 
car. The picture on the screen ap- 
pears to fold itself out like a spring. 
Bernstein grins, "This capability re- 
places the Qantel, which is about a 
five-hundred-thousand-dollar ma- 
chine." 

Dissolves that pour a picture 
onto the screen, texturing, anima- 
tions, metamorphoses of all types 
reveal themselves on his videotape. 




The subtle use of textures and shape highlights Bernstein's computer 
painting of David Bowie. 



Pictures become paintings, paintings become backgrounds for live 
action shots. 

"All this was done in real-time on an Apple." The tape winds down 
and Bernstein reaches for another. "I even use the Apple to help teach 
my classes. It's especially effective when we're investigating the classics." 
The new tape is a teacher. Bernstein speaks its accompaniment. 
"Using computer technology," Bernstein's taped voice begins, "I 
trace the S curve along Eve's arm in this painting of Adam and Eve, by 
Peter Paul Rubens, and start the computer searching for other instances 

of that form. 

"Students are inclined to think 
that the old masters are irrelevant 
because they were realistic and are 
now old hat, so to speak." 

Even as he says this, the com- 
puter belies the students, outlining S 
curves as it finds them throughout 
the famous painting, proving the 
depth of meaning and abstraction in 
the artist of old. "The whole paint- 
ing is composed of that one shape. 
The computer scans the painting 
and does a better job of finding the 
theme forms than I could. Since the 
computer does all the manipula- 
tions, I'm left free from any argu- 
ment. I didn't do it; let them go 
argue with the computer. Well, it 
ends up that it's a terrific abstrac- 
tion, relevant to their needs.

The Apple assumes a new role in an old classic. Here it can be seen tracing out an abstract S shape 
wherever it is encountered in this painting of Adam and Eve by Rubens. The abstractions Bernstein finds 
as he examines the classics are relevant to today's artistic needs. 



"It leaves the student in a quandary, doesn't it?" Bernstein chuckles. 
"In other words, I say, 'Here's the tape, take a look at it,' and then I just 
get out of their way." 

Unimagined Forms. A self-portrait by Rembrandt replaces the 
Rubens on the screen. The painting shows a full-face Rembrandt, but the 
computer sees more. Superimposed outlines bring out unimagined forms 
and devices.

posed with a three-quarter view. Not only did Rembrandt do this sort of 
thing, but Caravaggio before him, and Michelangelo before Caravaggio. 
Rubens, soon after Michelangelo, did it, too. In our own time, consider 
Pablo Picasso and George Brock." 

Now the screen shows a computer-drawn silhouette entirely derived 
from lines found in the original face-on painting. 

"The students have seen something and they're provoked. Now they 
either say, 'Well, the hell with it, I'm going to disregard it,' which is going 
to hurt their education, or they have to go for it — which means they have 
to study the old masters. Therefore, I win," he laughs. "It's very devious. 
I'm using twenty-first-century technology to explain seventeenth or eigh- 
teenth century painting." 

From the time Bernstein was eight years old until he was twenty-six, 
the city of Los Angeles was responsible for his education: from public 
school during the day to scholarships at night and in the summer. "The 
state was terrific to me," he says. "Teaching is my way of paying society 
back." 

Society's investment in Bernstein has been well returned to his stu- 
dents. "Back in the late sixties, during those campus protests, I remem- 
ber seeing a girl carrying a sign that said, 'Make our education more rele- 
vant.' Best thing that could have happened to me. It was a turning point 
in my career." 

Electronic Teacher. Searching for better ways to reach his students, 
Bernstein turned toward the most prevalent visual art form of today — 
television. "Before I used television, sometimes I felt like I was teaching 
seventeenth-century art like a seventeenth-century teacher," he recalls. 

"Although the content of television is usually very bad, as a docu- 
mentary tool it's terrific. It lets us remember the first step on the moon 
and the Kennedy assassinations. That's why the Super Bowl is so popu- 
lar, because it's an event, and television does a terrific job with events," 
Bernstein explains. "What's a more eventful moment than an education? 
So I went ahead and built a TV studio." 

Using an early black-and-white portable videotaping system, a 
simple special effects generator for titles, and a switcher for fades and 
wipes, Bernstein turned out 125 thirty-minute videotaped lectures com- 
posed of interviews and examples of art, which he used to supplement his 
courses. 

"Of course, my earlier work didn't look as smooth as a CBS produc- 
tion, but the content was really super. And I did manage to quadruple 
my enrollment," he adds with pride. The administrators always man- 
aged to find the money he needed for supplies, shades, and video 
equipment. 

Even when he's working with television, the educator in Bernstein

the Emmy and the West awards in 1981. Now the Sony comes to life 
with his tape of the show. "Needlecraft was almost all done with the 
computer," he says over the musical opening. His pictures form and dis- 
solve on the screen, counterpointing the music. "All the transitions, the 
wipes, dissolves, everything, were done on the Apple II." 

Because the Apple's output video signal is not directly recordable, 
Bernstein used the prototype video interface board, the VB-1, from 
Video Associated Labs of Austin, Texas. Now using the newer VB-3 
board, Bernstein praises its capabilities as "dynamite. You can knock out 
the color, blur the effects, superimpose, adjust the color intensity, do all 
kinds of crazy things. Sometimes, as with the Intelligence Graphics Sys- 
tem, I can't record the signal directly for the output, so I just videotape 
the images with a camera directly off the screen." 

On the tape, a narrator describes several types of stitches while the 
computer draws them on the screen, demonstrating the various stitches, 
weaves, colors, and textures. "That's the old Venetian blind game," ex- 
plains Bernstein. "The normal Apple transition, used just for the effect." 

Speaking about computers, Bernstein says, "Sometimes I'm glad I 
don't know their limitations. I keep trying to push the machines; some- 
times I get results that surprise even their creators." 

Sometimes the results surprise even Bernstein himself. "I only 
let out of the studio about 20 percent of everything I do — not that I'm 
ashamed of the other 80 percent. But when I get done with a project and 
look at it, I say, 'Goddamn it, it could be better.' The client may not even 
know, but I'll have done his job again and again until it's exactly what 
I want. 

"That may be the artist in me," he says. Bernstein identifies with an 
old shoemaker "I want to make every nail count; I want to make the 
whole shoe." 

Luck has little to do with art, says Bernstein. "I believe art is a com- 
bination of talent, training, and hard work. Play is important too, if it's 
disciplined play; it helps get the creativity going." 

Convinced that failure is often a better teacher than success, Bern- 
stein explains, "When you have a success, you're so goddamn busy doing 
it that you really don't have time to think. But when you have a failure 
and the hurt has passed, you sit down and analyze exactly what went 
wrong, and what in your mode of operations enabled it to go wrong. If 
you learn those reasons, before long you replace them with things that 
might lead to success." 

It's a lesson some people choose to ignore. "You hear people bitch- 
ing about their failures: 'Why didn't I go to school?' or 'Why didn't I buy 
a computer?' They prey upon that and, looking for a scapegoat, they 
blame society."

Saul Bernstein paints Leonard Bernstein on an Apple III. Aside from ttieir 
great love of the fine arts, the Bernsteins bear no relation. As Saul 
Bernstein predicts, "Someday the Picasso of the computer medium will 
come around. I thinl< it's that important." 




Bernstein believes that societies are remembered for their major con- 
tributions to world history. "The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel," Bern- 
stein says, "was a large billboard selling God." He adds that this could 
only bear relevance in a monotheistic society. 

"Here we have a melting pot. If I did a picture of what I thought God 
looked like, I'd have fifteen cults and thirty-two religions down on my 
neck in a minute. I wouldn't be communicating at all. Religion is not 
really where we are as a society.

"Ours is a technological, communicative society," he says. And as he 
considers where in fact we are, Bernstein's excitement approaches a 
benevolent zeal that may well be called religious. "We have landed on the 
moon, and we had the great ability to send the first pictures back to the 
whole world." 

Although the money is good and seeing a project finished is great, 
Bernstein considers his biggest reward to be meeting with "bright people 
who feel I have something to contribute." Winning an Emmy is certain- 
ly an acknowledgment from the television industry, to which he has al- 
ready contributed greatly. "I'll never forget my mother's and mother-in- 
law's reactions when I won the Emmy. That was worth the whole shot." 

Paintings versus Computer Images. The Sony's screen is dark, its 
reels still. Late afternoon sunshine glints off a window jamb, and it's time 
to call the question. 

Bernstein begins with the artist's relationship to and interaction with 
society. 

"If you're well trained and you spend a lot of time at your craft, you 
owe it to society to expose your ideas. The better you are, the more you 
are obligated. It's only through that kind of interaction that you grow." 

His pictures have the texture of paintings rather than computer 
images, says Bernstein. "My goal as an artist is fine art, whether on can- 
vas or on a video screen, and whether an image gets on paper using a 
brush or a printer." 

Imagine how Leonardo da Vinci's inspired work on human anat- 
omy might have profited by the gift of today's modern technology. The 
use of X-rays, sonar, and infrared would certainly have had profound 
effects on the fifteenth-century artist. 

Bernstein believes artists of the past have always been influenced by 
technology. The great masters were not only great artists, but engineers 
and scientists as well. Da Vinci was an architect and an inventor. El 
Greco was found to have kept a large collection of books on optics. 
Rembrandt was known to have studied the newly emerging field of etch- 
ing called aquatint. Goya left his home to study the new field of lithog- 
raphy, a field subsequently furthered by Toulouse-Lautrec. Degas was 
certainly influenced by the advent of the camera. And all painters of the 
time benefited by the discovery that paint could be mass-produced and 
marketed in tubes; with the portability this brought, the whole world be- 
came the artist's studio. 

"I'm convinced that someone, maybe not me, who is dealing with 
computer artwork will be remembered. I think it's that important. Some- 
day, maybe the Picasso of the computer medium will come around and 
maybe I'll become a footnote. 

"Well, if that's the way it is, that's the way it is." IM 



scene from Tom Porett's performance piece Softlands. More scenes are in this month's Fastalk. 



Thomas Porett has an impressive background in the visual 
arts, beginning with the master's degree from the Illinois Institute 
of Technology's Institute of Design. He has worked extensively in 
photography, electronic music, and computer art. 

Currently an associate professor with tenure at the Philadel- 
phia College of Art, Porett has recently created an impressive col- 
lection of artworks that Apple owners will soon be able to enjoy in 
their own homes. The package is called Softlands and comes com- 
plete with forty-eight color and black-and-white prints, two disks 
containing four performance programs, and a cassette of elec- 
tronic music. 

The process by which Porett created the images in Softlands is 
not overly complicated; indeed, the simplicity of the method en- 
sures maximum quality for the finished product. Porett has taken 
35mm slides and digitized them, storing the image on disk. He 
then takes the image and modifies it, as he sees fit, with a graphics 
tablet and mostly off-the-shelf software. 

Three of the prints from Softlands have been purchased by the 
Center for Creative Photography in Tucson, Arizona, for its 
permanent collection. The prints are conventional dot-matrix 
printouts from an Epson MX-80 using Pkaso, an intelligent 
printer interface card from Interactive Structures. 

This is high praise, and Porett is very pleased that "mere" 
printouts have been accepted for permanent display. Tucson is a 
long way from his current residence in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, 
but Porett wouldn't care if it was Nepal. 

The complete Softlands package is a change of pace for the in- 
dustry. You don't just admire a word processing program or 
game; you write or play. Softlands allows you to sit back and let 
the Apple entertain you. 

One program is called Softland and is roughly equivalent to 
the title track of a record album. For Softland, Porett constructed 
a databank of shapes, with shifting colors, that continuously com- 
bine and recombine into landscapes and scenes. Theoretically, the 
program could run forever; a copy ran for two weeks straight at a 
gallery. 

"It's like a live painting," says Porett, "though it's possible to 
stop the program and save a screen." 

The three other programs on the two disks are VisiDig (as in 
VisiDigitizer), Masks, and Animal Dreams. They are "slides-cum- 
movie," says Porett, and vary in length from two to seven min- 



utes. They're meant to run in synchronization with the 
soundtrack. 

Porett interfaced an Arp 2600 analog synthesizer with his Ap- 
ple to create the soundtrack for Softlands. "I used the Apple as a 
digital echo chamber and digital sequencer, with the help of an In- 
teractive Structures card, to create the electronic music." 

A minor inconvenience is having to synchronize the starting of 
the soundtrack and the tape manually. It's possible to interface a 
tape player and the Apple, but that requires a solenoid configura- 
tion and interface that is not normally part of an Apple's 
equipment. 

The twenty-two color prints included with Softlands are pho- 
tographs of RGB screens using twenty-two colors in the printing 
process. The black-and-white prints are photocopies of Epson- 
generated printouts. 

Porett first discovered the Apple about three and a half years 
ago through his good friend Joe Wilson, president of Interactive 
Structures. At the time, Porett was only interested in interfacing 
the Apple with the Arp synthesizer and only later realized its 
graphics potential. Now he can't get enough of it and declares that 
the Apple will continue to be the medium for his art in the fore- 
seeable future. 

"I saw a company at the San Francisco Applefest last No- 
vember that was offering a board with terrifically high resolution. 
I also want to explore the double-density graphics of the Apple 
He. Now that is very interesting. It could be a whole new level." 

Porett is currently writing a program he refers to as an "inter- 
active image fiction." He's also investigating mural-size blow-ups 
of some of the images he generated for Softlands . 

A prolific individual, Porett also copublishes a magazine on 
the Source called Muses. And at the Philadelphia College of Art, 
Porett teaches in the photography and film department. "We're 
edging toward the computer era," he says. 

Computer artists are just now acquiring wide recognition for 
their work. A hundred years from now they may be the only kind 
of artists we have. So hail the pioneers! Porett, Saul Bernstein, and 
a host of others deserve encouragement and praise. To them, 
graphic computers are more than just windows to arcade games 
and pie charts. 

To them, microcomputers are windows allowing an infinite 
number of ways to look at our world. — David Hunter

Caverns of Freitag. By David Shapiro. In this game, Friday's child is 
long, green, and scaly and breathes fire. Freitag (whose name means Fri- 
day in German, a fact of no apparent significance to the game) is a 
dragon who lives in the caves of the Enchanted Isles, awaiting the arrival 
of foolhardy adventurers to chow down. Perversely enough, Freitag 
seems to enjoy only tough adversaries, for he subjects the would-be 
heroes to an array of monsters and undesirables fit only for nightmares. 

In short. Caverns of Freitag is a sword-and-sorcery fantasy. In this 
case, the game is long on the sword part and rather skimpy on the 
sorcery. As a Thechu warrior, out to free the Enchanted Isles from the 
reign of terror imposed by the evil Freitag, you know but one spell: the 
"Charm of Sir Robin." This spell turns you into a long-legged bird, pos- 
sibly the offspring of an ostrich and a dodo, that can run twice as fast as 
anything in pursuit. However, this spell has definite drawbacks. As a 
bird, the adventurer tires quickly and must stand still to rest when the 
spell wears off, which allows the pursuer to overtake and pummel its 
hapless prey. Nevertheless, the "Charm of Sir Robin" comes in quite 
handy sometimes. 

The hardy warrior is expected to rely heavily upon weapons, the sword 
and the bow, amid the abundance and viciousness of the caverns' 
denizens. The monsters include electric moths, serpents, flamebats, 
burbleblorts, invisoids, offensive (in all senses of the word) wizards, grif- 
fins, and the deceptive mimics. This gang has a tendency to home in on 
the hero with reckless abandon. Often the monsters stand in line in a nar- 
row corridor patiently waiting their turn to trounce the warrior. 

The game begins at an inn at the western edge of a vast labyrinth of 
tunnels. The hero, a lowly stable boy, is equipped with sword, shield, 
bow, and twelve arrows. Within moments of his stepping away from the 
inn, sometimes even while he's still lodged at the inn, the monsters begin 
to converge. Game controls allow the player to select the amount of time 
used in each move, but even at the slowest speed the action is quite fast. 
In each turn the hero and the monsters are allowed one action or move; 
should the player be torn by indecision and let time pass while trying to 
figure out what to do, the monsters will move anyway. Being fast on 
your feet is just one of the necessities in playing this game. 

The game controls, keyboard only, take but a few minutes to mas- 
ter — although owners of Apples with type- ahead buffers or repeating 
keys face a challenge all their own. As you get worked up, the tendency 
to pound the keys furiously can result in a warrior literally pounding his 
head against a wall while the surrounding monsters chew him to pieces. 

Two controls we've come to know and love are missing: there's no 
save-game or pause feature. This means that, once the game begins, 
there's no turning back and no room for interruptions. Since the mon- 
sters will move even if you don't, you'd better forget about quick trips to 
the fridge. Certainly, only the hardiest of adventurers will be able to fin- 
ish the game. And this is undoubtedly just what author David Shapiro had 
in mind. Perhaps Caverns of Freitag should be advertised as a test of 
stamina and endurance. 

Nevertheless, the game is a whole lot of fun. Because of the forced 
moves, the pace of the game is quite fast and the play very intense. Inci- 
dentally, slaying the dragon doesn't end the game. The weary adventur- 
er must now fight all the way back to the inn — with every monster in the 
dungeon engaged in a personal vendetta against him. 

Caverns of Freitag is Muse's first major game since Castle Wolfen- 



stein, and it's a worthy successor. The hi-res graphics are delightful, the 
game quick-paced. Freitag could easily prove another blockbuster for 
them, every day of the week. DA

Metatrak II. By Scott Gibbs. When I was growing up and learning to play 
the piano, my parents ceremoniously marched me to the recording studio 
once every six months or so. Once there, I was placed at a monstrous con- 
cert grand. The engineer came in to adjust the microphone, then disap- 
peared to put a virgin black disk on the cutting lathe. When the light went 
from green (standby) to red ( record), every sound that came out of the piano 
(wrong notes, sloppy timing, and uneven dynamics included) went into the 
disk for all of posterity to hear. For a musician of my caliber, then, it was a 
no-win situation, guaranteed to yield nothing but frustration and 
embarrassment. 

No more! Nowadays, recording studios are equipped with multi- 
track tape recorders. With these recorders, musicians can conveniently 
record one track or more at a time, while correcting mistakes in individ- 
ual tracks by "punching in." Then they can mix the corrected tracks into 
a final piece of music. 

This method is standard procedure with producers of music for al- 
bum, film, and TV. It enables small groups of creative musicians to build 
complex sounds in the same way that a painter "builds" a painting, one 
"color" at a time, until the desired effect is achieved. In fact, multitrack 
recording has become so popular that many top recording artists now 
have their own private multitrack recording studios. Semiprofessional 
multitrack recorders, costing one-tenth as much as their fully profession- 
al cousins, are now available in musical-instrument stores throughout the 
world. 

The Syntauri people have created the Metatrak software to bring the 
basic concepts of multitrack recording to their famous AlphaSyntauri 
digital synthesizer. The AlphaPlus operating system sets up three main 
types of files, defining a sound's wave form; the overall shape, or enve- 
lope, of a sound; and patterns of pitches and loudness. All these are con- 
trolled by the manner in which the musician plays the Alpha keyboard. 

Metatrak uses much of the AlphaPlus system to produce tone colors 
and keyboard performances. It arranges and manipulates tone colors so 
that as many as ten colors are available at any one time. A musician may 
build a piece of music one track at a time, assigning any of the tone col- 
ors to any of sixteen tracks. 

Metatrak's commands actually closely parallel the control labels and 
functions of a conventional multitrack tape recorder: record, play back, 
erase, fast forward, and punch in/punch out. Here is how a typical "ses- 
sion" works: 

The musician selects a preset master (a group of ten tone colors) or 
develops one with AlphaPlus. This step is analogous to hiring session mu- 
sicians in a conventional recording studio. Then the track master dis- 
play is used to assign tone colors, loudness values, and vibrato param- 
eters to each of the sixteen tracks. This is similar to setting up micro- 
phones and adjusting levels. 

One of the tracks is put into record mode. The musician starts the re- 
cording by playing on the music keyboard. He can hear what he's play- 
ing at the same time. The musician then puts a second track into record 
mode. He hears what is on the first track, as well as what he is now 
playing. 

The process continues until the entire piece of music is recorded or all 
of the channels are filled up. At any time, the musician may edit a track 
by placing it in record, exercising the punch-in command at the begin- 
ning of the section needing additional work, playing over that portion, 
then punching out. As tracks are completed, they may be stored on disk.

MARCH 1983 



Finally, the musician adjusts the tone colors, volumes, and other mu- 
sical parameters of the individual tracks until they sound right togeth- 
er — the "mixdown" of the complete piece of music. 

From the user's point of view, Metairak moves easily and briskly 
through its functions. Tone-color selection is virtually instantaneous, sin- 
gle control characters set the recorder modes, and data entry on the 
track master and other displays is effortless. Metatrak is loaded with 
bells and whistles, features that are potent resources, handy facilities, or 
just fun to use. These features include a built-in programmable met- 
ronome, microtonal tuning, and programmable keyboard splitting that 
enables the user to play more than one tone color at a time. The new 
Metatrak 11 has the added feature of synching the output of the system to 
reel-to-reel tape recorders and to drum synthesizers. 

There's a bottom line for evaluating any music system: when you 
work with it, does it feel good and enable you to do what you want, or 
does it get in the way and create frustrations? Metatrak is definitely a sat- 
isfying musical resource. Its range of tone colors and accuracy of record- 
ing make it useful for serious production of recorded electronic music. 
The well-written manual and carefully thought-out software routines 
make using Metatrak a rewarding activity. RH

Sherwood Forest. By Dav Holle and Dale Johnson. If it seems Softalk is 
telling you almost every month that some new adventure has the best 
graphics yet, you're reading correctly. Adventure graphics are making 
such rapid strides that three adventures, released nearly three months in a 
row, have indeed topped each other and everyone else with the quality of 
their pictures. 

First there was Transylvania, from Penguin, that broke no particu- 
larly new ground; it simply had very well-done, attractive graphics. Then 
Mask of the Sun, from Ultrasoft, broke so much ground that it dug a 
huge crater. It lets you see where you're going as you move from place to 
place; the colors never fill in on-screen; and characters, icons, even doors 



are animated at times. And the general graphics are almost as good as 

Transylvania's. 

Now, comes Sherwood Forest. Having chosen a cartoon style of 
graphics, Phoenix has executed them with a sharp, clean, professional 
quality that appears to have been done on a drawing board rather than a 
computer. The colors are bright and clean and look as though they were 
all available as is. Round objects are smoothly round; nothing melts into 
anything else. Does the picture refill on-screen? Yes, but if you blink 
you'll miss it. And there's animation — not a whole lot, but what there is 
is realistic and beautifully done. 

So, despite repetition, Sherwood Forest has the best graphics yet in a 
graphic adventure. 

The adventure is fun to play, too. If you're bored unless you get to 
kill something, don't play. In Sherwood Forest, the player gets to be 
Robin Hood — only he's been away and none of his friends recog- 
nize him. 

As Robin, you have to reestablish yourself with your friends and win 
the heart of Maid Marian, marry her, and outwit the disagreeable Sheriff 
of Nottingham to take your rightful place in the castle. Castle? Oh, well, 
nobody said it had to be perfectly true to the legend. 

The puzzles are fun and mostly logical; some are pretty difficult and 
others pretty easy. Almost all of them require that you keep your eyes 
open and read all the descriptions carefully. The story hasn't great depth; 
but it's light, humorous, and enjoyable to play. 

There's warm, refreshing sunshine streaming through the trees of 
Sherwood Forest. tiCT

Cdex Training for VisiCalc. By Steven C. Brandt. Imagine you own a 
company with a number of people who could profitably use VisiCalc for 
various simple tasks. How do you train them to use it without wasting as 
much time training as they'll spend using the program? 

Cdex Training for VisiCalc is one way of doing just that, a way that 
uses the strength of the Apple itself. Just put the first disk into the drive 
and boot the machine. What unfolds is a graphic, interactive explana- 
tion of VisiCalc' s most basic commands. As such, Cdex does a good job. 

The three-disk set earmarks two disks for basic training, the third re- 
served for refresher use. Disk 1 teaches how to use the program, key 
terms, moving the cursor, labeling columns and rows, entering values 
and formulas, and working with functions. The second disk continues 
with using VisiCalc commands, saving and retrieving, printing, and repli- 
cating. The reference disk covers components, labels, values, formulas, 
functions, and commands. 

The manual has references to the various commands, some exam- 
ples to be entered into the Apple, and some exercises to be typed in. 

As far as it goes, this is a good way to learn VisiCalc's main strengths. 
It's the temporary-help approach: within a very short time, the trainee 
can perform beginning jobs. It doesn't give in-depth coverage. Explana- 
tions about the special functions of VisiCalc, such as ©SUM, are not 
given. Also omitted are templates, DIF, and the other, more exotic ele- 
ments that combine to give VisiCalc its strength. 

Nevertheless, for a time-short individual who wishes to learn or teach 
VisiCalc's basics in a hurry, quickly and painlessly, this is a good ap- 
proach, well executed. DRA

Dawn Patrol. By TSR Hobbies. Is it a flight simulator or a shoot-'em- 
down dogfight? As a real-time hi-res simulation of plane-to-plane dog- 
fights in World War I, Dawn Patrol leans to the fight. Choosing any of 
twelve World War I-era planes, the pilot must outmaneuver and destroy 
enemy aircraft. 

On the slight chance that you're a novice at flying circa 1915 planes. 
Dawn Patrol's training mode lets you practice in safety. There in the 
training mode, where enemy planes are merely dummies placed in your 
field of vision as reference points, you can learn to accelerate by hand via 
throttle, steer by foot with rudder pedals, and pull yourself out of acci- 
dental rolls and untimely dives with the all-powerful control stick. Once 
you've got her nose-down and stabilized, you can check your gun and 
look around.

What you'll see is everything where the plane isn't. Where the plane 
mostly is (you did pull out of that roll, didn't you?) is beneath you, so 
you can't see that dear old solid ground. You can see in five other direc- 
tions — up, forward, behind (those sneaky devils), and to either side. Bits 
of some of those views will be blocked, too, depending on which plane 
you're flying. 

Okay, now you're an expert — aren't you? And if you don't get out of 
training and start the game soon, you'll probably miss the whole war. 

Talk about white knuckles! Magic Mountain has nothing on this. 
And there's no way those dummies could prepare you for the real thing. 
These guys mean business. Will you return from battle an ace or a statis-

Dungeon. By Bruce Nesmith and Keith Enge. The original fantasy role- 
playing company, TSR, makes its. first foray into computer gaming with 
Dungeon. TSR is best known as the company that introduced Dungeons 
and Dragons to millions of game players. Dungeon is an exact adaptation 
of TSR's bestselling board game of the same name. 

The setting is an eerie, six-level dungeon. Monsters lurk in every 
room, guarding valuable treasures and magic weapons, and fierce cham- 
ber monsters roam the passageways. In the depths of the dungeon, the 
monsters get stronger and the value of the treasure becomes greater. 
There are traps to avoid, and parts of the dungeon are accessible only 
through secret doors, which players must discover. 

Up to eight players can play at one time, each person playing indi- 
vidually. Players choose their persona: elf, hero, superhero, or wizard. 
Elves are the weakest of the characters, but they excel at finding secret 
doors. Only wizards can cast magic spells. 

People who are trying fantasy role-playing for the first time needn't 
feel intimidated by Dungeon. There are three levels of difficulty avail-

able; they vary in danger, capacity (only elves and heroes can venture in 
level 1 ), and potential success (the rewards are greater and more is need- 
ed to win on successive levels). 

The dungeon is laid out two-dimensionally. All six levels are shown 
on one plane, with each level accessible from a neighboring level. The hi- 
res map duplicates the board of the board game. 

What doesn't duplicate the board game is the hi-res representation of 
characters and monsters. When a character enters a room, the screen 
zooms in on that room, with pictures of the room's occupants. If they're 
monsters, combat ensues, resolved by the computer. If the player is vic- 
torious, the screen shows a picture of the treasure. Although these images 
aren't generally animated, they encourage the feeling of being in the dun- 
geon much more than playing with miniatures. 

Where animation does occur, it's done excellently. The wizards' 
spells, throwing fireballs and hurling lightning bolts, are animated. Fire- 
balls burst from wizards' hands, growing larger as they fly aaoss the 
screen to blast monsters. The illusion is exceptional; you can ahnost feel 
the heat of the fireballs. 

Besides vast amounts of gold and silver, there are special treasures 
and magical items to be found. A secret door map discloses the location 
of all the secret doors. Magical swords add to the power of their owners. 
ESP medallions give the adventurer the ability to peer into a room be- 
fore entering — very useful if the monster in the room is a red dragon! 
And rare crystal balls enable their possessors to gaze about an entire level 
and spy the treasures held by the monsters. 

Dungeon is a good game for learning about the universe of fantasy 
role-playing. For kids and adult beginners in the genre, it's a fine, enjoy- 
able training ground. Now if the people at TSR could just figure out how 
to improve the graphics and add full animation, they could bring living 
D&D to the Apple. What an experience that would be! RRA

Beamscope II. Electronic Games raved about it. Video swooned. Com- 
puter Gaming World ignored it. And actually, the Beamscope is pretty 
good. In fact, after several years of life it has undergone some technical 
improvements and it's now very good. 

For those of you not in the know, the concept we are dealing with 
here is that of enlarging the screen area of your economy-size televi- 
sion/monitor without laying out a thousand bucks for a console televi- 
sion or a Sony Profeel. 

The Beamscope is a rectangular acrylic Fresnel lens in an aluminum 
frame, which, when placed in front of your television or monitor, pro- 
duces a much-magnified picture. It comes in several sizes. A model TS-25 
in front of a twelve-inch diagonal screen results in a twenty-five-inch 
diagonal picture; a TS-30 produces a thirty-inch picture from a seven- 
teen-inch screen; and a TS-41, flagship of the line, turns a nineteen or 
twenty-five-inch set into a big screen television. 

Anyone who plays games on an Apple or spends a lot of time squint- 
ing at eighty-column display on a twelve-inch black-and-white CRT can 
see the potential here, yes? So the only question is, does it really work? 

Yes. And it works better than some big screen systems you could 
name. The picture is not washed out, faded, or distorted. But if you have 
a small television and you buy a Beamscope, you will have a poor-qual- 
ity big-screen picture. By the same token, however, if you play Choplifter 
on an RGB color monitor, you will think you've died and gone to ar- 
cade heaven. 

A drawback to this product in the primary video market for which 
it's intended is its lack of peripheral viewing. That is to say, this is not 
something the whole family can enjoy, at least not simultaneously, at 
least not without everyone sitting on each other's lap. Computing, a 
largely solitary occupation, presents no such drawback. But no matter 
what the application, a darkened room is recommended. Lights that re- 
flect minimally off of a video screen reflect a great deal more off of a 
magnifying lens. 

A drawback for computing that is not one for boob-tubing is the fact 
that the Beamscope's picture is a function of distance. Optimally, the lens 
must be a certain distance from the screen and you must be a certain dis- 
tance from the lens. 

Alas, if you have your Apple hooked up to a nineteen-inch-or-larger

tire lens area and the picture will have a rather extreme Cinerama effect; 
it can look better than that.)

Labyrinth of Crete. By Cliff Johnson and Allen Pinero. Labyrinth of 
Crete represents two steps forward and one step backward for adven- 
ture gaming. Rather than going all the way with a graphics adventure, 
Adventure International has contrived the graphics-enhanced adven- 
ture. That is, the adventure is played in a text-only mode; full-screen 
graphics crop up from time to time to make things more interesting. For 
devotees of hi-res adventures, the graphics are perhaps rather humdrum, 
and altogether too sparse. That's the step backward. Next comes the 
good part, and it's very good. 

Here's what will make the adventurer forget any failings on the 
graphics side: you control two characters who not only can but some- 
times must act indef)endently of each other during the adventure. Until 
now it wasn't possible for the adventurer to control multiple characters 
who might need to act simultaneously in different parts of the dungeon. 

The setting is ancient Greece; the adventurer controls both Hercules 
and Jason, legendary heroes of the Greek mythos. The mission is to re- 
cover the golden fleece from the heart of the labyrinth, which is laid out 
as a three-level maze: the Labyrinth, Hades, and the Final Labyrinth. In 
the process, the heroes must face obstacles and characters from Greek 
mythology, such as multiheaded hydras, shifty titans, misbehaving gods 
and goddesses, and a three-headed puppy by the name of Cerberus. 

The authors have tried to maintain some true connection to the 
myths from which the game is derived; prior knowledge of Greek myth- 
ology helps to solve this one. An unusual feature: maps of each level of 
the labyrinth come with the package. 

The command sequence provides a precedence system (who's on 
first!) that allows manipulation of both heroes simultaneously or inde- 
pendently with great ease. When the two are together, any action that 
both can perform will be done by both at a single command. Should you 
wish one character to carry out a task that both could, merely specify the 
character you want to take action. When the characters are in different 
locations, you can control either with similar ease. 

The ability to use the two characters independently is integral to solv- 
ing the fairly tough puzzles in Labyrinth of Crete; it adds tremendous 
depth to the game. DA

Lovers or Strangers. By Stanley Crane. The ad shows a photograph of a 
young couple staring into each other's eyes before a sunset. But the pho- 
tograph's torn in half 

Hmm. . . . Apparently something went askew. Perhaps they should 
have spent some time with Lovers or Strangers. Perhaps they already 
have. 

It's a compatibility test that consists of thirty questions drawn ran- 
domly from a bank of sixty; that way, you get a different test each time. 
You sit side by side, using keys on opposite sides of the keyboard in such 
a way that you can't see each other's input. Each question is a multiple- 
choice with five choices. 

The questions cover areas such as communication, love and ro- 
mance, values, sex, spirituality, and play. 

Both participants choose the best answer to each question as it re- 
lates to them. 

As soon as both have selected their choices to a question, it's guess- 
ing time. Before moving on, you must guess how your partner answered 
the present question (this shows how well you know the other person). 

Now, let's see how we did. Once the test is finished, your results in 
each area (communication, romance, and so on . . .) are displayed on a 
linear graph based on a one-hundred-point rating system; the higher the 
number, the more you have in common in that area. Next, you're given 



the results of how well you guessed each other's answers. Finally, you get 
to see your overall compatibility score. 

If, for some reason, you want to keep a more permanent record of 
the test, you can print a hard copy of your test results. Still not con- 
vinced? Then take a look at how each of you answered each question and 
at how you predicted each other's answers. 

Lovers or Strangers is more than just an exercise in seeing how often 
you pick the same answers. Each question has fifteen different scoring 
possibilities. Even if you pick dissimilar answers (John likes musicals; 
Martha likes comedies), you may get a higher score than if you picked 
totally opposite answers (John likes musicals; Martha hates all art 
forms). 

The questions and scoring were designed by Dr. Al Byers and Dr. 
Annette Long, directors of Associates for Psychotherapy and Educa- 
tion. They stress that "tests don't determine how well people get along; 
people do." Further, Lovers or Strangers encourages you to talk about 
your similarities and differences after discovering what they are. 

It's unlikely that playing Lovers or Strangers "will keep you up 
nights," as they claim. 

It might, however, make the nights more interesting. HTV

Space Vikings. By Mitchell Robbins. After being badly beaten during a 
raid on one of the rebel colony star systems, Alpha Centauri, a Federa- 
tion starship is hobbling back to its home planet in the star system Sol. 
The Colonial Cruisers have made its task of supplying the Federation 
with equipment and supplies anything but easy. Maybe next time things 
will be different. 

The player/commander's duty is to bring peace to the galaxy by 
winning the war, which means securing twenty star systems. Success wins 
not only the war, of course, but the games, as well. 

Space Vikings is a three-dimensional combat simulation. It contains 
much of the real-time excitement and the visual effect of an arcade game 
combined with the detail and tactical considerations of a war game simu- 
lation. The galaxy and the spaceships are illustrated in 3-D graphics that 
surpass all previous SubLogic entries. 

Planets in this strange 3-D world must be conquered one by one. The 
Federation forces must overcome each planet's air defense ships, then 
launch a massive ground assault. Conquered planets remain under Fed- 
eration care and protection for the rest of the game. You can build bases 
on them and trade with them. 

There are many decisions that must be made before undertaking the 
task of conquering a planet. From maximizing crew morale to supervis- 
ing ship repairs, the decisions are crucial; only after many fruitless mis- 
sions will the Federation begin to realize its goals. 

The starship computer handles hyperspace travel between star sys- 
tems automatically. Within star systems, the player/commander must 
guide the starship manually. And here appear the game's flaws. The con- 
trol of the spaceship is slow and ponderous. The hi-res screens refresh 
themselves at an excruciatingly slow pace. After the outer defense bat- 
tles, the descent to the planet drags on for a long while. The ascent from 
the planet is equally slow. The ship feels like it is flying through taffy. The 
program is very ambitious in its scope; perhaps a faster language should 
have been used to achieve its ambitions more fully. 

Overall, Space Vikings is a well-done space adventure simulation, but 
it calls for the persistence and patience of the war gamer to master its 
many variables. Despite its problems, it establishes a new, promising 
genre, which is an applause-worthy victory in itself DAD

The Filer. Simple and snappy. The Filer offers some handy tools for 
home use — and it works with drives of thirty-five, forty, or even seventy 

tracks. 

The Filer's four utilities perform tasks easily and quickly. The file util- 
ity facilitates locking, unlocking, deleting, and copying standard files. It 
also contains an option to alter disks' boot programs. 

Two disk-drive-related utilities perform less accessible tasks. A diag- 
nostic program investigates the health of your disk drive and disks, dieck- 
ing the read/write heads of the disk drive, verifying that the write-pro- 
tect switch is functioning, and certifying and verifying disks. A disk speed

test displays the disk drive speed in milliseconds, against a norm of 
200 ms. Instructions are provided for adjusting your disk drive speed if 
necessary. 

Perhaps the most useful utility is the Fast Copy. This is one of the 
fastest straight copy programs available, swiftly reproducing the content 
of any unprotected Apple-compatible disk in DOS, CP/M, or Pascal. 
With two drives. The Filer copies a standard disk in less than forty sec- 
onds. CopyA, on the System Master disk, takes almost that long to for- 
I mat a disk before it starts copying.

: at hand. That's certainly a refreshing marketing approach. R'RA

Epidemic! By Steven Faber. This appears to be the year of the medical 
game. Robert Clardy voyaged fantastically with medicine in Synergis- 
tic's Microbe, Sirius is offering a similarly themed game for brand X ma- 

\ chines, and here comes SSI with another contender. As Groucho might 
say, "Take two doctor games and call me in the morning." 

Sirius's entrant is a shoot-'em-up; Synergistic's is a blend; Epidemic! 

I is, of course, strategic. 

Earth, it seems, has entered the path of a swarm of meteorites that 
are infested with a deadly virus. The map of the world is s^mented into 

I fourteen areas. Wherever one of these areas is hit by a meteorite, an epi- 
demic begins. 

As director of the Center for Disease Control, the player controls the 
I forces battling the spread of this virulent disease. The arsenal of curative 
methods available includes interferon, vaccine. X-ray treatments, and 
various other remedies for the early stages of infection. You can even im- 
i pose martial law. When the virus reaches its second, pneumonic stage, 
you have access to weapons such as cloud-seeding and killer satellites. 

Epidemics may travel across borders. The Soviet Union has boun- 
daries with five other geographic regions; South America has only one. 
Nuclear strike on a r^on is a last resort. This eradicates the qjidemic by 
eradicating the populace. Because your score is dependent on succeed- 
ing with the least possible number of casualties, this option is one to 
avoid gamewise, too. 

Each of the cures has a certain duration of activity. Each day it's 
active, a cure reduces the epidemic a certain percentage in its target area. 

The mapboard shows the stages of infection in each affected region. 
A daily status display for each region describes the effectiveness of the 
current choices of remedies. A radar screen shows the meteorites enter- 
ing the atmosphere and tracking paths. 

The program's documentation skimps when describing how the cures 
differ from each other in effectiveness, which makes it somewhat diffi- 
cult to choose the best cures with confidence. Nevertheless, Epidemic! is 
an absorbing game, quite different from the rest of the Strategic Simula- 
tions line. t)A

Amperware. By storing data in compressed binary blocks, Amperware 
reads text files twenty times faster than conventional Applesoft does. 
This compressed form of storage saves disk space and allows for the stor- 
age of commas, colons, quotes, and control characters in text files. 

In Amperware's process of creating disk files (either random or 
sequential), print and input statements are exchanged for &READ and 
&WRITE. The length of a single text file is limited only by Applesoft line 
lengths and may be sent with a single &WRITE command. In fact, 
whole arrays may be stored with the statement &WRITE B%. 

Clearing out arrays from memory without setting all other vari- 
ables to zero is no easy task in Applesoft. With Amperware, a simple 
&CLEAR— Q$ does the job. Sorting arrays, another tedious chore in 
Applesoft, is now turned from task to trick. To sort a list, you tell Am- 
perware which list to sort (K), where to begin (0), and where to end 
(N=65). An array R with dimension 64 can be sorted completely with 
the statement &SRT-K=R(0), N=65. 

The elaborate scheme of pokes and calls used for setting text win- 
dows in Applesoft is dispensed with. By defining top, bottom, left, and 
right, you may create a text window of any size. Of course, being able to 
set a text window also requires a positionable cursor. This, too, is easily 



163 

accomplished by means of the &MOVE command, a handy combina- 
tion of htab and vtab. 

Like the &READ and &WRITE commands for data files, Amper- 
ware provides fast and flexible input routines. Commas, colons, ques- 
tion marks, control characters, upper-case and lower-case characters, 
string length, alphanumeric checks, and default values are all handled 
easily by &INPUT. The command &INPUT-L=5, R=S$ limits the 
user input to a length of five characters and defines the response as alpha 
code. To establish a default input (that is, a return = none), simply add 
to the program's code the line if R$= then R$="none". 

Many programmers who learned their Basic in school or on larger 
computers were disappointed that the print using command doesn't exist 
in Applesoft. Here, the command &PRINT WITH allows you to put a 
place holder in your program, producing output that will always 
be displayed with the decimals aligned, rounded to two places, and pre- 
ceded by a plus or minus sign. 

Programmers who have experienced the awe and mystery of assem- 
bly language programming may have noticed that the commands JSR 
and JMP will execute with either an address or a label in their operand, 
whereas Applesoft's gosub and goto commands require a line number. 
Amperware allows you to assign the value of a line number to a variable 
to execute the commands — a trick that would net you an "undefined 
statement error" if you were using Applesoft alone. 

Amperware has many other simple and useful subroutines, such as 
&HOME, which will do the job on an eighty-column screen. &CLEAR 
PAGE and &CLEAR LINE both perform exactly the same way as call 
-958 and call -868. 

Special characters and convenience features are also provided with 
this utility. Typing control-K allows you to input the elusive left bracket, 
backslash, underscore, and several other special characters. Both control- 
D and control-I act for the user exactly as PLE does for the program- 
mer, deleting or inserting the characters under the cursor and shifting the 
following characters accordingly.

Checkers. By David Slate. It's not a hard game to learn how to play. 
Most of us learned the rules at an early age. But few have truly learned 
the game. 

If you're looking for a few quick games to pass the time, go dig out 
the checkerboard from the hall closet and the checkers from that old 
shoebox. Set 'em up, and you're ready to go. 

But if you're looking for a way to learn the ins, outs, hows, and 
wherefores of the game, Odesta's Checkers can provide you with volu- 
minous help and insights that grandpa and Uncle Ed couldn't even 
challenge. 

Checkers is not just a game. It's a textbook tutorial on a disk that in- 
cludes games as a way to try out what you've learned from the manual. 
And there's much to learn. 

The manual starts you off by teaching the most basic rules of check- 
ers: how squares are numbered, what moves and jumps are legal, how to 
king, and how to control and move your pieces. Next, it explains how to 
read the move display. The move display lets you know the status of the 
game in progress. From it, you're able to see each move that's taken 
place, how far ahead the computer is looking when figuring out its strat- 
egy, and the skill level of each player. 

Perhaps the strongest point of Checkers is its selection of more than 
twenty commands, all of which you can choose during the game. One of 
the most popular features is the advice command, which tells you what is 
probably your best move at the time. Extensive use of the command 
doesn't, however, guarantee your winning the game. But the computer 
won't try to trick you into making a bad move. It'll merely point you 
toward what it thinks is your best option. 

Another helpful feature if you're learning the game is a command by 



which you can set the skill levels for yourself and for your opponent. The 
higher the skill level selected, the more "look-ahead" the computer pro- 
vides. In other words, at level zero the computer moves its pieces ran- 
domly and quickly; at each higher level it plans further and ftirther 
ahead, taking as long as several hours to make its move at its highest 
level, fifteen. 

For those who like to know just where they stand during a game, the 
evaluation command lets you know which side is winning and by 
how much. 

Other convenient options let you take back moves (so you can cor- 
rect an error— not so you can cheat), play against another person and not 
the computer, see the board from the other side, and change the pa- 
rameters of the game for everything from the scoring scheme and game 
penalties to the responsiveness of the game paddles. 

The graphics of the game aren't fancy. Checkerboard squares and 
round pieces don't lend themselves to much fancy artwork. The real 
strength of Checkers lies in the manual, about a third of which consists of 
appendixes. Useful appendixes. 

One useful appendix explains in depth about the program's fifty-eight 
modifiable parameters and how to change them. The second is a short 
tutorial that skims over the basic principles of checker strategy. 

If any microcomputer software publisher produces examples of arti- 
ficial intelligence, it's Odesta. If any of its programs serves as a primer on 
artificial intelligence, it's Checkers. Though Odesta's Chess and Odin are 
also based on artificial intelligence. Checkers offers an introduction to 
the same concept through a more simplistic game. 

Don't expect to win often when playing against the computer. What 
Checkers helps you do is learn the strategies of the game, not get used to 
winning. 

If winning is all you want, there's always Uncle Ed. HTV

Know Your Apple. Finally, a software publisher has come to the aid of 
the many new Apple users. Usually neophite Apple owners spend hours 
wading through the two large Apple manuals, and some still end up 
thoroughly confused. 

This program takes much of the mystique from the workings of the 
Apple. Every step of the program presumes that the person has a com- 
puter literacy quotient of zero. In crystal-clear hi-res pictures of the dif- 
ferent parts of the Apple, the area under discussion flashes for easy 
recognition. 

There's a thorough description of the keyboard and all its functions, 
then explanations of the back connectors and the workings of the Moni- 
tor. The best two sections of Know Your Apple deal with the inside of the 
Apple and the ofwration of the disk drives. 

Every major aspect of the interior of the computer is highlighted and 
clearly explained. Most people are terrified to take the covers off their 
new computers, much less start inserting items. The program explains the 
proper placement of different boards, how to plug in the paddles or joy- 
stick, and even precisely where to put a lower-case adapter. 

Disk drives and the disks themselves remain a major mystery to many 
longtime Apple owners. Know Your Apple not only provides a clear ex- 
planation of the operation of the drives, but also explains how a disk is 
formatted and how data is recorded. 

The Monitor section shows the lo-res and hi-res colors and explains 
what pixels are. Then a single picture is shown, first in lo-res, then in hi- 
res, making clear the difference between the two modes of graphics. 
There's also a demonstration of the way the speaker pwrforms. 

The packaging of Know Your Apple is unique: the box takes the 
shape of a miniature Apple II Plus. The brief manual is simple and clear- 
cut. Written in large type for easy reading, the manual contains a five- 
step photo outline for initial setup of all your hardware. 

For new users of the Apple, Know Your Apple is an outstandingly 
worthwhile program. People leam much more easily with visual instruc- 
tion than by trudging through weighty manuals. RRA

Pandemonium. By Norman J. Wazaney, Jr. In the entertainment software 
world of flashy graphics and lightning reflexes, a game relying on neither 
faces quite a marketing challenge. Pandemonium accepts the challenge 
and succeeds in being a well-executed, solid, thinking game. 

A hybrid of Scrabble and various forms of Boggle, Pandemonium 
challenges you to form words horizontally, vertically, and from top to 
bottom on the two diagonals of a five-box-by-five-box grid. Letters vary 
in point value, and bonus points are awarded for making words of three, 
four, or five letters. Certain squares on the grid double or triple the scor- 
ing value of a letter within a valid word. 

There are four variations of this basic game contained in Pandemon- 
ium. Each variation brings different analytical skills into play. Basically, 
the computer generates random letters one by one that you must place in 
the grid, forming as many words as possible. Variafions allow you to by- 
pass five letters and move the letters around after you have them all. 

The game comes with a five-thousand-word dictionary that is loaded 
into RAM when the game begins. The dictionary isn't all-inclusive, but 
it's quite thorough.

Knowledge Bowl. Yes, learning can be fun. Somehow, the anxiety gen- 
erated in an academic testing situation becomes intellectual excitement 
when the context is transferred to a CRT. 

Knowledge Bowl is a high-caliber educational program for those fif- 
teen and up and is capable of doing double duty as an entertaining trivia 
contest. 

The entire series covers virtually every academic discipline, broken 



down into specific subjects. The questions — all two hundred thousand of 
them — range from the terrifically obscure to the immediately topical 
("Who was the Israeli defense minister during the occupation of West 
Beirut?") 

A single disk contains four hundred questions plus a quiz and com- 
petition mode for two players. In the quiz mode, the user selects a topic 
from among several categories and specifies the number of questions to 
be presented. The user types in his name; then the computer-resident 
"Great Auk" offers a multiple choice, true-false, short answer, or fill-in. 

Mind you, Auk is no dummy! The questions are a definite challenge. 
The user types in an answer and Auk immediately checks the response 
and maintains a running score throughout the game. However, Auk only 
knows when your answer is wrong on the multiple choice questions. On 
all spell-out answers, if you don't type in the precise answer Auk wants, 
he displays the answer he knows and asks you to tell him whether you 
were right or wrong. You're on your honor to be honest and, after all, 
Auk's pretty nice to give you the opportunity to take credit for Charlie 
Chaplin when he expected Charles Chaplin, or for deoxyribonucleic acid 
when he was primed for DNA. 

After each correct answer Auk gives you a little boost by printing 
such exclamations as "Outstanding," "Hubba hubba," and "Kowa- 
bunga." (These also serve to make you feel darn guilty if you've been 
cheating.) On the other hand, if your score is very poor. Auk lets you 
know that also. But don't worry; you have the option of repeating the 
questions you missed. 

In the competition mode, two players can vie against each other and 
Auk. Players are assigned keys on opposite sides of the keyboard. After 
the players agree upon a category and the number of questions to be 
asked, Auk throws a question on the screen. The first player to press her 
game key has four seconds to begin her answer. Her opponent has a 
chance to offer an alternate answer or pass. If both players are stumped, 
they can give up. Then, or if both players give wrong answers, Auk wins 
the round. 

The competition mode is an excellent school learning tool. Classes 
can divide into teams for some healthy competition. 

A special utility disk available for faculty features question modifica- 
tion and printout programs. The Knowledge Bowl generator prints out 
rounds for oral competition. 

Knowledge Bowl is also a great tool for adults wanting to review 
old skills or increase their knowledge of literature or the social and physi- 
cal sciences. What's more, it's fun. 

Academic Hallmarks offers a preview disk with representative sam- 
plings on a variety of subjects. You can purchase the sampler for $5, or 
you can submit a blank disk to the publisher and the preview material 
will be copied free of charge. A heck of a bargain for a couple of eve- 
nings' fun. RR

Frontline. By Terry Eagan. This is a fast-moving game of wits and strat- 
egy. It combines many of the intricacies of chess with the moments of 
sheer terror integral to some of the meaner arcade games. In short, it's a 
lot like real war. 

The battle is fought on three fronts. You face your opponent — the 
computer or another android Hke yourself — across a pencil-thin front 
line. You have airplanes, infantry, and anti-aircraft to assign to each 
front. The lessons of war dictate that you try to be "the firstest with the 
mostest." But if you pile all your infantry on the left, how will you keep 
your enemy from penetrating on the right? 

Each game consists of five battle rounds, with a pause between 
rounds to get your thoughts together (and possibly walk around the 
block just to psych out your opponent). At the beginning of each round, 
each side of each front is defended by three infantry and four anti-air- 
craft units. You have an offensive air-strike force consisting of two 
planes on each front. And you also have a reserve force of fifteen infan- 
try and six anti-aircraft at your disposal. You decide when the planes 
attack and where the reserves are to be assigned. 

Once you start, you can just sit there and wait, but if you do your op- 
ponent may begin without you. Your orders will be executed one at a 
time, but you can stack up commands so there will be no hesitation in 
implementing them. Here is where your skill is called upon. If you hesi-

tate too long in bringing up reserves, you will lose to a faster opponent. If 
you stack up commands as fast as you can press the Apple's keys, you 
may end up sending too many men to one front (where they will wait 
unused in the rear line) or attempting to dispatch nonexistent reserves. 
Frontline is a test of reflexes, of brains, and, if played against a hu- 
man opponent, of generalship — the combination of audacity and bluff 
that can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. PC

Micro Barmate. By Brian Skiba. Have you ever wanted to impress your 
boss, your friends, or perhaps your enemies with your dazzling skill at 
mixing drinks, but ended up serving martinis so wet you could swim in 
them? If making a scotch and soda is totally beyond your comprehen- 
sion, then Micro Barmate is the ideal solution. This unique program 
steps through the entire preparation of more than two hundred twenty 
popular and diverse drinks. 

The drinks are indexed by name and classification. Once you choose 
your poison, a list of its ingredients appears. Detailed instructions for its 
preparation come next. Even a picture of one of the eight glass styles is 
shown to make sure you don't blow the show by serving that perfect 
Manhattan in a brandy snifter. 

There is room on the disk for 255 drinks, meaning you can add your 
personal favorites to the roster. Also, the recipes that come on the disk 
may be modified to reflect preferences, and you can add disks for a truly 
huge library of innkeeping. 

And this is only the beginning of the program. The flourishes add to 
the fun. When you have a limited bar — and how many home bars stock 
all the fill-ups possible?— give Micro Barmate a list of the ingredients you 
have available and the program will search out and list all the drinks you 
can make with what you have. Imagine how impressive you'll be as you 
rattle off twenty-one exotic drinks made with rum or eleven sophisti- 
cated scotch drinks to your guests. 

Another feature of Micro Barmate provides considerable back- 
ground knowledge on alcohol-related subjects; it can even help in plan- 
ning a party. There are hints on bartending, suggestions for stocking 
your home bar, recipes for making your own liquors (yes, it is legal), and 
even a calorie chart. A unique alcohol limit guide shows graphically what 
the safe drinking levels are for individuals, based on their weight, to stay 
under the one-tenth of a percent blood alcohol content. Who can argue 
when the computer says you've had too much to drink to drive safely? 

All the recipes can be printed out, as can a handy shopping list of in- 
gredients needed for a party. The program even provides a selection of 
printer interfaces for the most popular printers. 

Micro Barmate is one of those specialized programs that are time- 
less. It can keep you impressing those significant others for years to 
come. Now then, what was the "pouring order" for correctly creating a 
layered zombie? RI^A

Bomb Alley. By Gary Grigsby and Joel Billings. By the summer of 1942, 
German Field Marshal Rommel was rampaging across North Africa 
toward Egypt and the vital Suez Canal. One obstacle stood in his 
way: Malta. British air and naval forces based on the ancient island fort- 
ress had begun to sink an appalling number of Axis ships, threatening 
the very existence of the Afrika Korps. British General Montgomery had 
reason for his ruthlessness. The fate of the Suez Canal and, hence, of the 
British Empire hung in the balance. 

Bomb Alley re-aeates, in great detail, that desperate struggle from 
Gibraltar in the west to the Suez Canal in the east. Before you're finished 
with Bomb Alley, you'll understand the grim motto of the German fight- 
ing men of World War II: "Enjoy the war, because the peace will be 
dreadful." Almost every aspect of the entire Mediterranean theater has 
been taken into account in this game. 

It is as much a strategic game of supply as of military maneuvers. 
That Hitler could not be strong everywhere led to his eventual undoing 
in the Libyan desert. Good thing he didn't have Bomb Alley to help him 
decide the course of the war. 

Bomb Alley uses the same game system SSI used in Guadalcanal 
Campaign. Like Guadalcanal, Bomb Alley is a huge game; you can ex- 
pect to spend twenty-five to fifty hours to play the full scenario, which 



covers eighty -two days from June to August 1942. Every plane and ship 
available to the historical combatants is accounted for and represented 
with its relative capabilities. The game is enhanced by the simulation of 
the "fog of war," with resulting limited intelligence reports, inaccurate 
information, and concealed movements. 

Despite its complexity of detail. Bomb Alley is one of SSI's easiest 
games to play. For those who never seem to find a free fifty hours, two 
shorter scenarios are provided. "Operation Pedestal" simulates the gal- 
lant British mission to run the German blockade of Malta. The "Crete 
Scenario" portrays the struggle for the strategic island of Crete, which 
became the grave of Germany's elite paratroopers. 

The combat descriptions are given in an almost You Are There tone. 
Short of having been in a war room beneath Number 10 Downing Street 
or in the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, the excitement couldn't be greater. 

Although the graphics are once again in lo-res, none of the details of 
the engagements are lost. SSI rates Bomb Alley as an intermediate level 
simulation. It is a worthy successor to Guadalcanal Campaign and will 
captivate gamers of all levels. WUU

Most arcade games plunk you down into an artificially violent situa- 
tion and let you run with it until you die. Their inherent violence is the 
root of many people's objections to video games. What these people tend 
to overlook is that the world is violent. Especially if you take a longer 
perspective of history. 

What Mattrick and Sember have done is design a video game that 
takes that longer view of things: a view encompassing something like 
three bilhon years (fundamentalists may take this figure as metaphori- 
cal). They haven't done away with the violence of the arcade game in cre- 
ating Evolution, but they have conquered the artificiality of the violent sit- 
uation. Picture yourself as a simple one-celled creature (the first level of

Evolution) trying to eat DNA and avoid being eaten by spores, mi- 
crobes, and antibodies. The motivation is clean why am I eating these 
things? Because I'm hungry! 

The next two levels have the same plot with different casts. Tadpole 
attempts to eat fly without being eaten by fish. Rat tries to eat cheese 
without being eaten by snakes. The players' personae (animae?) behave 
differently, but up to a certain point on the evolutionary chain, it's the 
same story, repeated again and again. 

As might be expected, the higher animals have more complex and in- 
teresting behaviors. Instead of worrying about where their next meal is 
coming from, the beaver in level four must build a home. The gorilla in 
level five has a home, but must protect his food supply from thieving 
monkeys. The highest level, although it makes some sense in the pro- 
gressions, unfortunately succumbs to the artificial. In it, a human in a 
room with walls that deflect weapon fire must kill a bunch of mutants. 
Oh, well. 

When a nuclear explosion destroys the world and the evolutionary 
cycle starts over again, you might well wonder what the point of it all is. 
You work your tail off trying to better yourself. You save up your flies, 
or cheese, or oranges, trying to become human, and where does it get 
you? You become an amoeba again. 

These are not just idle questions. Evolution is a neat idea for a game, 
but that ultimate regression makes it kind of depressing. Sure, this allows 
them to give you more playing levels, but that could be achieved in an- 
other way. Surely they could have come up with more than six steps from 
amoeba to human? For one thing, they skipped directly from early am- 
phibious life forms to mammals. What happened to reptiles? Couldn't 
they have done something with the first multicellular forms? These are 
parts of evolution too. 

A host of other questions remains unanswered. Where did the 
amoebas get shields? Where did the cheese come from if humans hadn't 
evolved yet? Mattrick and Sember's theory of evolution may cause as 
much controversy as Darwin's did; it seems to have as many missing 



links. Nevertheless, it's a unique concept and a challenging game. DD

Understanding Artificial Intelligence. A book by Paul Y. Gloess. A ma- 
jor problem in the field of artificial intelligence (AI for short) is the lack 
of a really good definition of intelligence. As a result, it's hard to say ex- 
actly what is included in the field and what isn't. Roughly speaking, "ar- 
tificial intelligence" refers to computers that "think" — but what exactly is 
"thinking"? 

To put it another way, the ultimate purpose of AI research is to 
create a machine or system that can interact with the user just as another 
human being would — without the user having to learn a special lan- 
guage or special programming techniques to use it. For example, such a 
machine could answer a question like, "How big is this object?" instead i 
of a series of questions such as "What is the distance from this point to ' 
that point?" "And from that point to the next?" "And from that point 
to. . . ?" 

Thus the ideal artificial intelligence should be able not only to com- , 
municate with the user in his own language, but also to write and debug 
its own programs, select and operate the appropriate input and output i 
mechanisms, and generally run its own life like an intelligent being — all 
of which is easy enough to describe, but very difficult to do. 

Understanding Artificial Intelligence covers work in four general 
areas: game strategies, logical proofs, visual pattern recognition, and na- I 
tural language behavior (that is, English or French — not Basic or I 
Pascal). ! 

In the section on games, the book describes a technique for analyz- 
ing ticktacktoe so that a computer can find the best move in any situa- 
tion. This method does not look much like what a human does in play- 
ing the game, but it produces similar results. Of course, ticktacktoe is a 
very simple game; but similar strategies have been effectively applied to 
games as complex as chess (for example, the Sargon chess program or the 
new Chess 7.0). 



Did You Hear the One About the 

Computer That Talks? 



It's no joke. 



With the ECHO speech synthesizer from 
Street Electronics whatever you type on the 
keyboard, your computer can say. The ECHO'S 
text-to-speech system gives your computer an 
unlimited vocabulary while using a minimum of 
memory. And now a diskette of fixed, natural 
sounding words is available to enhance the 
ECHO ]['s voice output. 



Nearly 400 language rules are contained in the ECHO'S text- 
to-speech algorithm. These rules enable the computer to 
pronounce most correctly spelled words. When in the text-to- 
speech mode the user can select any of 63 different pitch levels, 
and have words spoken either monotonically or with intonation 
by using simple control character sequences. The rate of speech 
can be fast or slow; words can be spoken in their entirety or 
spelled letter by letter. The ECHOs also pronounce punctuation 
and numbers. Words can be encoded using phonemes and 
diphthongs when the text-to-speech or fixed vocabulary is not 
required. 

Applications are unlimited, ranging from phone answering, 
educational and training programs, to games and aiding the sight 
and speech impaired. The ECHO is a complete stand alone unit 
which is compatible with most any computer; it sells for $299.95. 
The ECHO ][, which plugs into the Apple ][, is priced at $149.95.

In the area of logical proofs, Understanding Artificial Intelligence de- 
scribes an approach to the design of a system that can write a program, 
given the specifications, and then test it to see if it works properly. How- 
ever, the book only tells you what must be done, not how to do it. 

Almost half the book is devoted to language processing. Starting 
with the "Predicate Calculus" — a set of rules for manipulating logical 
statements as if they were mathematical formulas — it goes on to de- 
scribe an approach to the nonlogical types of statements we humans use 
in talking to each other. This is called "natural language processing," and 
it may be the most difficult area in the whole field of AI. 

Finally, there is a short section on visual pattern recognition — an- 
other difficult area. For example, how do you get the machine to tell 
which part of the picture is the object we're looking at, and which part is 
background? 

TTie trouble with Understanding Artificial Intelligence is that it's too 
small (forty-eight pages) for its subject. AI is full of questions such as 
"What is the nature of intelligence?" and "What is the mechanism of 
creative thought?" — and you can't cover a field like that in forty-eight 
pages! 

However, if you're new to the field, the book is a good introduction. 
It will show you what AI is about and how some of the problems are be- 
ing attacked. And, like all good scientific works, it has a list of references 
at the end. JR

Crystal Caverns. By Daniel Kitchen. A crumbling, deserted mansion 
sets the tone for Hayden's first text adventure game. Like all good de- 
serted mansions, this one is rife with secret rooms and hidden panels. 
Unlike all good deserted mansions, it doesn't stop there. Somewhere on 
the grounds of the mansion is the lost entrance to the dark, mysterious 
Crystal Caverns that sprawl beneath the manor. Hidden deep within the 
caverns, it's rumored, is a vast treasure. 

The would-be adventurer must do a lot of work in this adventure. The 
game gives hardly any clues. All progress has to be won, step by step. 
Just getting into the mansion poses quite a problem. Discovering how 
things are hidden away in the mansion tests the best ingenuity. 

All this work is but a prelude to the caverns. In the dank caves the 
really hard part begins. The caverns' many inhabitants relish a meal of 
adventurer stew. Exotic treasures abound at every turn, but so do traps. 
Be careful with the underground furnace! 

Crystal Caverns is written primarily for intermediate-level adven- 
turers. The game is quite reminiscent of the original Colossal Cave Ad- 
venture devised in the dawn of computer adventure gaming. Hard-think- 
ing novices may solve most of the game, but some of the key stumbling 
blocks require a bit of adventuring expertise to overcome. In sum. Crys- 
tal Caverns offers several hours of enjoyable fun and thought.

but Infocom (and its tens of thousands of devotees) has sung a dirge for 
the genre; and a deep bow as well for making it a good one. RRA

Understanding Pascal. A book by George Ledin, Jr. Understanding Pas- 
cal will not (as the title suggests) give you a complete understanding of 
Pascal; but it will enable you to recognize a Pascal program when you see 
one and help you to figure out its logic. 

More important, it will give you an overall look at the language, an 
impression of its personality and flavor — more specifically, a summary 
of the data types and structures used and the principles of logical 
organization. 

Pascal is very big on structure — it has rules, and rules witliin rules, 
about where to put things in the program. These rules are logical enough, 
but they seem arbitrary at first; however, once you learn to use them, you 
can untangle the logic of any Pascal program. 

This book summarizes the logical structures used in Pascal and 
shows you how and when they are used. Once you understand that, the 
rest is merely detail. 

Of course there are quite a lot of details, and they're all important. 
This book is not enough, by itself, to make you into a skilled Pascal pro- 



grammer. But it can help you make up your mind about whether to be- 
come one. 

One final note, about format. This book, like all the Alfred Handy 
Guide series, is made in an unusual shape: four inches wide and eleven 
inches high. This is convenient for carrying in a coat pocket, a tool kit, or 
other small space; but the text has been printed sideways — the book is 
actually four inches high and eleven wide — which makes it a bit awk- 
ward to read. You also have to turn pages a lot, because in many cases a 
program example will be printed on the back of the page that explains it. 
However, these are minor nuisances. They won't prevent you from get- 
ting the information. )R

The Creator. By Gary Haffer. It's only been a couple of years since the 
British announced grandly that they had the universal cure for strep 
code. The Last One. The name, we were assured by resolutely immodest 
representatives, stemmed from the fact that it would be the last software 
package we'd ever have to buy. 

It was the first announced code generator for microcomputers, and 
we were assured that The Last One would write all our software. 

The imagination soared. One big splurge and we'd have all the ar- 
cade, strategy and adventure games, database programs, word proces- 
sors, mailing-list handlers, and accounting packages that our heart de- 
sired. Had nirvana ever been so near? 

Then reality settled in. The Last One lived up to the name in grimly 
ironic fashion — no one who saw or bought the first commercial version 
wanted anything to do with a code-generation program again. Ever. Not 
only was it The Last One, it was the last straw. 

Overselling capability was a big part of the problem. All code gen- 
erators are limited by the application areas the authors choose to ad- 
dress. And most authors narrow the scope of their code to what are gen- 
erally recognized as database applications. No word processors. No ac-

counting software. No games. No graphics. What the publishers of code 
generators overlooiced was that existing database-manager programs 
were sufficiently versatile to handle most of the applications that could 
be written with such limited code generators. 

The overheated expectations were unfortunate because code genera- 
tors have a long and honored tradition among larger systems and are al- 
most mandatory in environments where custom applications software is 
needed muy pronto. There's no reason why microcomputer owners 
shouldn't have the same advantage of writing large blocks of code in a 
short time. 

That's the value of code generators. They'll write bug-free code at the 
flick of a wrist. Furthermore, the source code will be available to the user 
to modify for custom requirements, unHke commercial database man- 
agers that protect their source code and, incredibly, sometimes even leave 
the data files beyond the reach of the user. 

The current generation of program writers ranges, in the end prod- 
uct, from full-fledged database managers to fairly simple file managers. 
The most powerful varieties belong in systems software departments of 
large companies using lots of micros in varied ways. The simpler pro- 
grams belong to the home or small-business user who wants a simple 
program in a hurry, or to the programmer who wants a lot of code in a 
hurry that can then be spruced up. 

77ie Creator falls into the category of a file-manager developer. It's 
remarkable in that it lives up to its author's claim: you don't need to 
know programming to obtain satisfactory results. 

Satisfactory is the highest mark the end product gets, however. The 
Creator doesn't give you elegant code, or even efficient code. It gives you 
error-free code. If you've ever spent hours tracking down a bug in ele- 
gant code, you'll appreciate that last statement. But you won't be creat- 
ing a program to rival DB Master for performance. 

The main advantage of The Creator is speed in writing code. You can 
have a mailing-list program running in fifteen minutes. An invoice pro- 
gram might take twenty minutes. A complex personnel records program 
could stretch out to thirty. At the end of those short time spans, you get a 
program in Basic that runs error-free. At your leisure, you can go into 
the code and make it more efficient and more elegant. 

Software Technology for Computers, publisher of The Creator, 
points out that its code can be compiled for greater execution speed. 
That's true, but the program uses pokes into memory to attain certain 
goals. That means you need to be proficient in the use of your compiler 
and understand how the code is using memory so that you can compile 
around crucial memory locations. A better approach might be to use the 
assembly-language-subroutine libraries that such companies as Anthro- 
Digital, Micro Lab, and Southwestern Data Systems are publishing. 

Author Gary Haffer has done a complete and thoughtful job in pro- 
viding a file-manager-development package. Of course, there are the 
necessary ingredients: input, edit, and report routines. Also induded a 
menu routine, a sort routine that's not half bad for being in Basic, and a 
five-level filter for culling only desired records from your files. 

Hafi"er has also provided extra value in the manual. There's a chap- 
ter on how to use Basic; another chapter is a guide to writing programs. 
There are also sections dealing with how to enhance the final program 
and providing tips on maximizing Basic and using DOS. Yet another 
section provides useful applications. For a novice, being able to scru- 
tinize working code and applying the manual is almost worth the price of 
the package. 

Anybody can make The Creator work. So if a file manager can han- 
dle most of your database applications, the software will save you time 
and money. ART

Ghost Drive. By Dean Phillips. For those fortunate enough to have two 
disk drives, there's a wide variety of business-and-accounting software 
packages available. 

Ghost Drive is a clever piece of hardware intended to fool an Apple 
into thinking a second drive is connected, making these programs acces- 
sible to a wider range of users. 

Ghost Drive consists of a small board occupying any peripheral slot 



(including zero), and a small remote box that can be tape-mounted to the 
side of the computer or of the real disk drive. It's just as convenient to set 
it on the table. Besides the small wire connecting the two modules to- 
gether, there's a fourteen-pin ribbon cable with a plug that replaces one 
of the integrated circuit chips on the Apple disk controller card. The re- 
mote unit has an LED indicator that signals when the second drive has 
been requested and a small toggle switch that does the actual selection 
between "drives." 

Installation is a snap; no soldering is required, and you end up with a 
spare IC in the bargain. Ghost Drive is also easy to use. When a pro- 
gram calls for the second drive. Ghost Drive freezes the processor and 
lights the LED. Then it waits for you to insert the correct disk into drive 
1 . That done, a flip of the toggle switch allows the program to contin- 
ue — with your poor Apple none the wiser. The switch is labeled to show 
which drive is active, eliminating any chance of errors. 

This package is a useful and imaginative accessory, and it's a whole 
lot cheaper than a second disk drive. EW

Bug Byter. By Ted Cohn and Pete Rowe. It's funny how we can use a 
word every day and forget its original meaning. Take the Monitor in the 
Apple: not the CRT, but the program in ROM. Think about what it 
means. It's a device — a software device, but a device nonetheless — for 
monitoring what's in the computer's memory. That's neat. A lot of com- 
puters don't give you that kind of access. And yet, there's a lot that the 
Monitor doesn't do. 

And what it doesn't do is what Bug Byter does. They say it's a ma- 
chine-language debugger, but it's really a window into the Apple. It 
doesn't let you see anything you can't see with the Monitor; the Moni- 
tor can show you anything in memory. With forced break points you can 
even see the status of the 6502 registers. But while the Monitor offers still 
pictures of memory, Bug Byter gives you movies. In color. 

Bug Byter monitors your machine-language program while it's run- 
ning. This is no small feat, as by necessity Bug Byter must be running at 
the same time. Bug Byter accomplishes this by acting as a machine-lan- 
guage interpreter, reading the instructions of the monitored program and 
interpreting them. At the same time it updates the screen display of the 
lines being executed, the status of the stack, the values in all the registers, 
each flag in the status register, and user-selected memory locations. 

Because Bug Byter does all these things, it slows down the running of 
the program that it's monitoring. In step mode the monitored program 
executes one line at a time; you move it forward to the next line with the 
space bar. In trace mode, the program moves along pretty fast, although 
considerably slower than it would without Bug Byter. You can control 
the speed with a paddle if you want. The reduced speed is important for 
debugging, because normally, when a machine-language program does 
something unexpected, it's moving so fast that it's in the next state be- 
fore you can stop it. 

If you need to see what your program is doing to a text or graphics 
screen while you're monitoring it, you can toggle any of the Apple's soft 
switches that control the display mode and page while the trace is going 
on. Because the program uses the text screen for its display, you can't 
toggle between the register readouts and a text screen your program is 
controlling; you must choose one or the other for the entire simu- 
lated run. 

Bug Byter has some other useful features. In command mode it does 
number-base conversions between hex and decimal. It gives you control 
over break points; you can insert or remove a set of breaks with a single 
command. A machine-cycle counter will give you an exact readout of 
how many cycles your code takes to execute. There's even a miniassem- 
bler built in so you can modify your code easily without having to go 
back to the source-code assembler to do it. 

Machine-language programming need not be an arcane art. When 
you can see what's going on at the most elemental level of the machine, 
as you can with Bug Byter, you are one step closer to mastering 
the 6502. DD

While patrons are swinging and skating, mingling with the local fauna, arcading, or wandering through any of the attractions on Funway's three 
levels, Joy and Dick Buri (lower left) manage everything . . . with a little help from a friend. The Apple also handles in-house video advertising, 
cued by disc jockey Mike La Due between tunes (lower right).

DAYE ALBERT 



After innumerable musings on the possibilities of an Apple in a true 
arcade, one finally shows up ... on the wrong side of the counter! 

Five years ago, Dick and Joy Buri bought an Apple II to help run 
their burgeoning amusement park, Funway Square, in Batavia, Illinois. 
Although it may appear unassuming from the outside, Funway is some- 
thing of a complex, with sixty-five thousand square feet under its roof. Its 
component parts include a full arcade with pinball, standup, and table 
video games, foosball tables, a bumper car area, a full-sized roller skat- 
ing rink, a family restaurant, and a set of batting cages that are open dur- 
ing the summer months. 

Good Times on the Funway Express. The arcade and the restaurant 
overlook the skating area, with the bumper car area right beside the ar- 
cade. The roller rink is festooned with posters and signs and has a huge 
video screen at one end. Smaller video monitors are scattered about the 
rest of the whole area. And nestled away in an office behind the disc 
jockey's booth at one corner of the rink is the Apple that keeps track of 
everything. 

Gone is the go-cart track that started Dick Buri on the road to pro- 
viding surrounding communities with good, clean fun. He began that 
business in 1959, after years of working in various trades to solidify his 
background. Previously, he had worked as a carpenter, electrician, 
handyman, and garment worker. All of these lines of work helped him 
develop skills that are useful to him in his present endeavors. (He still oc- 
casionally sews the costumes for the skaters.) 

"I started the go-carts because I really love to work with kids," Buri 
explains. "In 1967 we put in the bumper car building, and finished it in 
'68." By 1974 the batting cages and the arcade were built. In 1976 a three- 
level building that was to house the new arcade, the restaurant, and the 
roller rink was started. 

That was also just about the time Buri bought his Apple. "What a 
tool — the machine is frightening. I bought it to help do commercials on 
the monitors [there are eleven placed in various areas of the complex, 
with tapes of musical groups constantly running, as well as listings of 
coming events], but I haven't had time to really get it up and running." 
Instead, Joy Buri uses the Apple to keep track of all the scheduling for 
Funway. 

A three-and-a-half-million-dollar complex, Funway would not be 
able to exist on walk-in trade from the community of Batavia. The Buris 
have concentrated on locating customers within ever-increasing circles 
around their Batavia location. Church groups, scout troops, aerobic ex- 
ercise groups, youth groups, park district organizations, and other com- 
munity groups are prime targets for what Funway Square offers. The 
computer has proved to be an invaluable tool for keeping track of what 
markets have been tested and which have borne fruit. 

When one enters Funway, one promptly notices the pervading at- 
mosphere of wholesomeness. Funway is a controlled environment. Eve- 
rything works, all the machines are in good shape, the place is always 
clean, and the people who run it seem endowed with endless patience and 
good nature. The Buris plan everythmg out, from parties to security and 
maintenance. Every piece of equipment, from skates to video games to 
electronic gear to bumper cars, has its scheduled time for maintenance. 
All the repair and maintenance work is done on the premises by the staff. 
The upkeep is simplified by the Apple, which allows the Buris to keep 
track of all the inventory in each of the Funway Square areas. 

Bohiering for Messages. To do so, they use a database management 
system set up by another Apple-owning friend of theirs. During the past 
summer a local student, Chris Bohler, worked part-time as a program- 
mer. Bohler helped the Buris get current inventory and scheduling sys- 
tems running smoothly. He also implemented a message system for put- 
ting up colored messages on all the video monitors in Funway. It took a 
full week of programming to work out the color incompatibilities be-

tween what was programmed on the Apple and what showed up on the 
monitors after videotaping. Just as things got rolling, Bohler returned to 
school in the fall. That left Joy with the task of keeping data entry going 
and all of the scheduling on track. 

"I just came in and did it," Joy explains, stressing that she is only be- 
ginning to figure out what the computer is capable of doing. "I realized it 
was a superexciting thing, but you need the time to learn about it. When 
I took the time, I found out you could do all sorts of things." 

One of Joy Buri's first projects was to create a complete catalog of 
the hundreds of videotaped music pieces Funway uses in the roller rink 
and throughout the park. Garnered from a wide variety of sources, these 
tapes are played during skating hours, and on particular artist nights. Joy 
now has full lists of what each performance is, along with comments on 
its suitability for certain groups, and each piece's starting position on 
each video cassette. What used to be frantic searching is now a mo- 
ment's work for the person in the control booth. 

The rink is designed around a train station theme, with benches that 
were originally built in Chicago in 1902 and then brought back to the 
area from train stations all over the country and refurbished. The rail- 
way station ticket booth, where one buys entrance to the skating area, 
was built in 1886. 

Bookings for use of the rink, which is the heart of the operation, are 
sometimes made months in advance. The computer is used to keep track 
of what group will be using the rink at what time, as well as who will be 
using the "Birthday Depot." On weekends the rink and depot area are 
booked full for three different two-and-a-half-hour sessions, and all dur- 
ing the week the evenings are reserved for different groups from various 
surrounding communities. A good part of Funway's business comes 
from banquets and birthday parties, all of which must be scheduled and 
fit in where possible. 

Flaming Fox Valley Speedsters. As members of a national roller 
skating association, the Buris hold skating clinics in which youngsters 
learn to skate, working to earn merit badges for certain levels of accom- 
plishment. According to Dick Buri, keeping track of who is at what level 
with group sizes of up to 275 kids can be tedious. "Before we got the Ap- 
ple it was all paperwork. There was an ungodly amount of writing to be 
done." Funway also sponsors a speed skating group, the Fox Valley 
Flames, and holds meets at the rink. These meets involve some twelve 
hundred racers, all of whom must be registered and kept track of during 
what can at times be a week-long event. The Apple makes this task quite 
simple. 

Funway employs some forty-three people, a dozen of whom work 
full-time. Work schedules — time off, and who is taking care of what area 
of the amusement center at what time — are all prepared on the Apple on 
a weekly basis. Besides the people running the various areas in the park, 
there are seven "animals," excellent skaters in specially designed cos- 
tumes, who entertain the different groups of kids who come to skate or 
celebrate birthdays. 

The vast amount of scheduUng — customers, staff, and equipment — is 
complex and time consuming. The Apple has greatly reduced the time re- 
quired to run Funway and has allowed the Buris to concentrate on im- 
proving their services and expanding their business. Yet Buri is frus- 
trated because he feels that he has barely tapped the potential of his 
Apple. 

"I don't have enough time to sit down and learn how to use it. I'm 
crazy when it comes to advertising, and when I see that fancy graphics 
stuff on television, I want to do it here. Sure they use bigger machines, 
but that doesn't mean I can't do it; I just have to think in smaller terms." 

Funway's video monitors are aU wired into a disc jockey's booth 
down in the roller rink. From that control point, using the library of hun- 
dreds of records and tapes, the disc jockey floods the entire complex with 
videotapes of current musical groups playing everything from top forty 
to disco to gospel to hard rock. It's the time between the tapes that Buri 
uses for advertising. Using messages typed via Synergistic's Higher Text 
and then taped on a video cassette recorder, he alerts the kids to upcom- 
ing events and specials, and to whatever promotion Funway might be 
running for the next couple of weeks. Hundreds of people see those mes- 
sages, particularly on weekends, and that pays off. 

For Dick Buri, however, typed messages are just the beginning of the 
kind of internal advertising he would like to do with his Apple. Losing 



J 175 

Chris Bohler last fall set his plans back a bit, but he believes the Apple 
will enable him to do animated graphics commercials that may even- 
tually find their way onto the airwaves over a local public service cable 
television channel. He has the equipment to do graphics work, and he 
has the software. What he doesn't have is the time to learn to use them. 
Nor does he have any programmers on his staff, a situation he is consid- 
ering doing something about. 

"I've got to find an individual who thinks simple," he explains, 
"someone who can help me get what I want out of the computer." 

Coordinated Future Kids. What does an arcade owner think of the 
Surgeon General's recent comments about the effects of video games on 
youthful minds? 

"He doesn't know what's going on. Just watch these kids, eight-year- 
olds with fantastic hand-mind coordination. They're geared to comput- 
ers, their lives are hi-tech. These are the kids of the future; they have 
everything in their favor." 

For Buri, watching the kids is everything. He sees children growing 
up with technology and finds it reassuring. When he encounters the less 
favorable aspects of youth, drug use and rowdiness, he deals with things 
quickly and quietly. The offenders are removed from the premises and 
handed over to local authorities. But to Buri that's just a small part of 
what goes on in an amusement park. He's more concerned with the kids 
who are developing sharp minds. He sees some kids not just playing 
games, but figuring them out and deciphering the programs behind the 
animation and action. 

Dick Buri has found his nidie. He provides entertainment for all, but 
for children in particular. He draws a lot of his inspiration from another 
man who spent his life entertaining people: Walt Disney. 

"I just patterned my whole program after Disney," he says. "He was 
a super individual. He had a lot of foresight, and it's kind of always been 
man's nature not to have foresight." 

It was Disney's use of technology that first steered Dick Buri in the 
direction of computers, and it is Disney's vision of providing good, clean 
fun for the family that is the guiding light at Funway Square. 

Not a bad act to try to follow.

SOFICARD 
Symposhim 

by Greg libbetts 




Welcome to yet another installment of SoftCard Symposium. We 
broke off last month's discussion of the BIOS character I/O routines af- 
ter examining CDNST and CONIN, the console status and console in- 
put routines. This time we'll begin looking at CONOUT, the console 
output subroutine. 

The code for CONOUT is more complex than that for the two sub- 
routines we looked at earlier. That's because in addition to taking care of 
the simple display of characters CONOUT must handle operations 
known as screen functions. Before looking at CONOUT in more depth, 
it's important that we understand the differences between screen func- 
tions and simple character display. 

Character display is the routine process of printing a character or a 
sequence of characters to the video screen, b^inning at the current cursor 
position and continuing from left to right and from top to bottom. 
Terminal screen functions, on the other hand, are special operations per- 
formed by the display device or video driver. Screen functions don't 
cause a character to be displayed; rather, they cause either cursor move- 
ment or a radical alteration of overall screen content. These functions 
may be as simple as moving the cursor up a line, down a line, or what- 
ever, without altering the data being displayed, or as complex as clearing 
a complete line of text (with no cursor movement at all) or clearing the 
entire display. 

Unfortunately, the difference between character display and screen 
functions is not so clear-cut as the foregoing descriptions may seem to 
imply. We have said that character display involves the output of a par- 
ticular single ASCII value that causes a specific character to be placed on 
the screen. We've also said that screen functions usually involve a se- 
quence of values that are output and that have some effect on the dis- 
play but do not generate a screen character. However, in between these 
two are certain ASCII values, such as the carriage return and linefeed, 
that we output the way we do characters, but which, like screen func- 
tions, cause cursor movement in place of character display. These, you'll 
find, may be called characters or screen functions, depending on who's 
speaking. The difference seems to lie in how well the industry in general 
accepts them as standard characters. 

The ASCII value 1 3, for example, is universally accepted as a car- 
riage return and has the universally defined effect of moving the cursor to 
the beginning of whatever line the cursor is on. The same sort of thing is 
true of ASCII value 10, which is universally accepted as linefeed and 
moves the cursor down a line while maintaining its horizontal position. 
True screen functions, on the other hand, usually vary from one manu- 
facturer to another and from one terminal or display to another. 

For some reason, many people seem to have difficulty with the con- 
cept of screen functions. For them it's an area that seems somehow com- 
plex and mysterious. If you're one who has this reaction, you might try 
thinking of these functions simply as control codes, a concept we've dis- 
cussed often in the past. Like printer control codes and serial device con- 
trol codes, functions are not treated as data. Rather, screen functions are 
used by the display device as a signal to perform some operation, just as 
your printer performs a formfeed when it receives a control-L or what- 



ever code it recognizes as the formfeed signal. Screen functions, then, are 
simply control codes for the display device. Likewise, just as the set of 
printer control codes varies from printer to printer, the set of screen func- 
tions varies from display to display. 

In practice, there are a good number of simple standard functions 
normally used by all display manufacturers and a number of extra func- 
tions an individual manufacturer might see as useful. By and large, 
whether it alters all data on the video screen, only a part of that data, or 
perhaps none at all, the purpose of a function is to increase the efficiency 
of the data display process. In some cases the efficiency increase takes the 
form of speeding up the output; in others, it produces a better-look- 
ing result; and in still others, it makes possible the performance of a task 
that could not have been accomplished without a screen function. It's 
usually safe to say that the more functions a terminal or display device 
supports, the more flexibility it offers the programmer. 

As an example, the function of clearing the display and moving the 
cursor to the top left-hand corner of the screen may be simulated to a 
limited degree by simply outputting twenty-four carriage returns. Doing 
this does not generate as good a result, though, as a Clear Screen/Home 
Cursor function. After all, the cursor is still at the bottom of the display 
and there is a column of CP/M prompts (A >s) down the left side of the 
screen. 

Similarly, clearing a line of text may be simulated by issuing a car- 
riage return, printing a full hne of spaces, and then issuing a second car- 
riage return. This creates just as nice an effect as issuing the Clear to End 
of Line function with the cursor in the first column. It is not as efficient, 
however, since as many as eighty-two character values will have to be in- 
dividually printed via normal output channels. 

Other functions, such as moving the cursor up a line or turning the 
cursor off altogether, simply can't be simulated using the standard char- 
acters. SoftCard CP/M makes use of a number of special functions in 
addition to standard things such as hnefeed, carriage return, and back- 
space that are supported as part of the Apple Monitor or eighty-column 
display device. For purposes of this column, we'll break out the nine 
screen functions that can be altered using the CONFIGIO utility and 
consider these alone as screen functions. All other sequences, regardless 
of their effect on the display, will be called character output. 

The nine screen functions are named and described in table 1. Such 
standard items as a nondestructive backspace (cursor back) or linefeed 
(cursor down) are not included there since, as we've said, these are pretty 
much standard items within the ASCII character set. 

These nine functions, then, are the ones that can be modified under 
SoftCard CP/M to match up with the requirements of various display 
devices. It must be noted that such modifications don't alter the way the 
various functions work. Cursor Up, for example, is virtually the same on 
every type of display. What gets modified is the sequence of values that 
must be output by user software to cause the function to happen. Cursor 
Up on one terminal may be caused by the simple output of ASCII value 
1 1 (the ASCII Vertical Tab), as a character value. Another terminal may 
require an ASCII value of 27 followed by an ASCII value of, say, 55 (a

sequence in which an escape character is followed by the number 7). In 
the latter case, the escape character is called the lead-in character for the 
function. The presence of the lead-in character lets the video driver 
(whether contained in ROM or RAM) know that the sequence is a 
screen function and not simply the character 7 to be displayed. 

The use of the lead-in is probably the most common method of im- 
plementing screen functions. The reason for this is the fact that with lead- 
ins no individual ASCII values need to be reserved (and therefore not 
used in other ways). Unless a value has the lead-in character immediate- 
ly preceding it, the video driver simply prints it or ignores it based on 
whether it is a printable character. Because of this arrangement, 
TYPEing to the screen a non-ASCII file that contains such values, or 
using software that routinely outputs the values for some purpose of its 
own, won't foul up the video display except on those rare occasions when 
the lead-in and the control code are in the correct order. Even so, some 
display devices do not make use of lead-ins. When these devices are 
being used, special care must be taken to avoid random output of values; 
otherwise, some bizarre things may happen in the display. 

We now have enough information to begin our examination of the 
CONOUT subroutine. 

CONOUT is the fifth entry in the jump table at the beginning of the 
BIOS. In 56K CP/M, this places it at ODAOCH (in 44K, it's at 
OAAOCH). The Digital Research criteria for CONOUT states that the 
subroutine must take the character value in register [C] and send it to the 
current console device. It also states that the character will be transmit- 
ted as an ASCII value with the high-order bit reset (0), meaning, of 
course, that the value will be between 0 and 127 decimal. Beyond that, 
the choices of what the subroutine will do are strictly up to the designer. 

In the case of SoftCard, the implementation of the lOBYTE means 
that the character may be sent to a variety of possible devices (the selec- 
tion is similar in structure to what we discussed last month for input de- 
vices when we were talking about CONIN). Consequently, the 
CONOUT subroutine itself (at 0DB43H in 56K) has as its first task the 
decoding of the lOBYTE to determine which of the physical devices — 
BAT;, TTY: (remember that TTY: is both TTY: and CRT:), or UCl :— 
is in effect. The first check is made for the BAT: (meaning batch mode) 
device, since if BAT: is in effect the output will be through the logical list 
device. 

As you'll recall from last month, we talked about the fact that 
CONIN has a minor bug; namely that the address contained in Reader 
Input Vector #1, rather than the address of the READER subroutine it- 
self, is used in batch mode. This means we'll always get our input from 
the physical RDR device instead of from the currently assigned physical 



device. The very same situation exists with CONOUT. SoftCard selects 
the address contained in List Output Vector #1 rather than the address of 
the LIST subroutine, meaning that our output always goes to the LST 
device, even if another physical device is currently in effect. 

In essence, then, batch mode goes through specific physical devices 
and is not subject to further indirect vectoring (by letting the READER 
and LIST subroutines reexamine the lOBYTE). Given that BAT: is sel- 
dom used, these are not potentially serious problems. Nevertheless, they 
are not totally in alignment with Digital's criteria and may therefore be 
altered if one wishes. 

Both problems can be corrected in the same manner, and although 
the original plan was to explain how to do this as part of the column, it's 
really a better use of space to issue this change separately. If you'd like to 
receive it, send a stamped, self-addressed envelope to SoftCard Solution, 
Box 60, North Hollywood, CA 91603, and we'll send it to you. (Sorry if 
this causes any inconvenience.) 

For now, however, let's continue to look at what happens if BAT: is 
not selected. As soon as CONOUT determines that BAT: is not in ef- 
fect, it transfers control to a subroutine at 0DB97H called TTY0U2. 
This subroutine first determines which of the two remaining physical de- 
vices, TTY: or UCl:, is assigned to the logical console device, storing the 
results in a variable location called VECFLG, at 0DEA2H. 

The determination is made by using the resuh of the comparison with 
the lOBYTE at the beginning of CONOUT. When CONOUT first ex- 
amines the lOBYTE, it compares the lOBYTE's value to the value it 
would have if BAT: were assigned. It then tests for a zero result. If the re- 
sult turns out to be nonzero, CONOUT goes to TTY0U2. Essentially, it 
has by this time also determined whether TTY: or UCl: is in effect as 
well, since these values are one less than BAT: and one more than BAT: 
respectively. 

The compare instruction sets the carry flag if the value is lower than 
the one it's being compared to and clears it if it's greater than or equal to 
that value; this leaves the carry set if the lOBYTE contains the value for 
TTY: and clears if it contains the value for UCl:. TTYOU2 then uses the 
carry value by subtracting the value in the accumulator [A] from itself 
with an SBC AA instruction. If the carry is clear, 00 will always be left 
in the [A] register, and if the carry is set, OFFH will always be left there. 
The value in the [A] register is then loaded into VECFLG for use later in 
determining where to send the character. 

For now, though, TTY0U2 ensures that the character has its high 
bit clear and then examines a variable called ESCNT, at address 
0DEA3H. This variable is used as a counter to count down the number 
of characters already processed in a cursor addressing function. It is 
needed because cursor addressing, also called GOTOXY (from go to x, 
y), requires a number of values to work with — the lead-in, the function 
character itself, and then the row and column coordinate values. The vid- 
eo driver, therefore, must have a way to check (as each value is received) 
which value is being processed at the time. 

Assuming that no GOTOXY function is in progress, ESCNT will be 
00 and control will pass to a routine at ODBEOH, called NOESC. This 
routine is responsible for examining the character being sent to deter- 
mine whether or not it is a screen function. First, it checks yet another 
variable (called ESCMSK) at 0DEA4H. This variable is used as a flag to 
indicate whether the previous character sent was a lead-in. If it was, then 
it will have a value of 80H; if it was not, its value will be 00. 

If the test of ESCMSK reveals that the previous character was not a 
lead-in, NOESC then checks to see if the current character is a lead-in. 
As you've no doubt guessed by this time, the most common lead-in is the 
escape character (although other characters certainly can be used). 

The standard lead-in character (if any) is always stored at the begin- 
ning of the software screen function table in the lOCB. This table begins 
at 0F397H and goes to 0F3A0H inclusive. 

NOESC tells whether the current character is a lead-in by loading the 
value of the standard lead-in character from the table and comparing it 
against the value of the current character being sent in register [C] to see 
if there's a match. If so, NOESC recognizes that a lead-in has been sent 
and that the next character processed should be the screen function it- 
self To ensure that this next character is tested, it sets ESCMSK equal to 
80H and returns for the next character of output.

You'll notice that no attempt is made to transmit the lead-in charac- 
ter itself. It is for this reason that in the standard version of SoftCard 
software a single escape character cannot be sent to an external console 
device. To send a single escape character successfully, you'd have to send 
two escapes, the first of which would be discarded as a lead-in. Since 
none of the functions consists of a lead-in followed by an escape, the sec- 
ond escape would be transmitted normally. 

Note also that a moment ago we mentioned the software screen func- 
tion table, implying that there is also a hardware screen function table. In 
fact this is correct. The relationship between these two is very straight- 
forward. For example, the first item in the software screen function table 
is the same function as the first item in the hardware screen function 
table. This one-to-one correspondence between the two tables is 
complete. 

Although there are many different sets of function control codes, de- 
pending on who manufactured the display, application software must 
send a single set of codes. In CP/M, this is one of the most difficult items 
for the software producer to cope with. Most companies handle it by 
supplying some type of installation or configuration program to allow 
users to insert their own particular screen function codes into the 
program. 

SoftCard's designers decided to go this one better and allow the 
user to make the software screen function codes and the hardware screen 
function codes independent. If, for example, you're using software de- 
signed for a SOROC I-Q-120 terminal, but have a Hazeltine display, you 
simply set the software table to SOROC and the hardware table to 
Hazeltine. 

Now the reason for the one-to-one correspondence between the two 
tables becomes clear. When a screen function value is received from the 
software, the BIOS translates that software value into the appropriate 
hardware value using the two tables. The BIOS takes care of making sure 
that the codes get translated properly. 

Since at this point we're still examining the character received from 
the software, we're looking at the software function table. We'll en- 
counter the other table when we do the actual output. 



When we left NOESC, it had just found a lead-in and set ESCMSK 
to 80H before returning. It's now time to go back and see what would 
have happened if the character had not been a lead-in or if it had been 
the character following a lead-in. 

Had the character not been a lead-in, and also not followed a lead-in, 
NOESC would then have transferred control to a routine called 
FNDFNl at 0DBF5H. This is where the character would have been ex- 
amined for possibly being a single-character screen function. Since all 
single-character screen functions must be control codes, FNDFNl sim- 
ply checks to see if the character value is less than 32. If not, it knows that 
the character is printable and proceeds to print it. If the character is a 
control character, control proceeds on to FNDFUN, at ODBFAH, the 
routine immediately following FTVDFNl . FNDFUN is also where con- 
trol would have come to directly if the character had immediately fol- 
lowed a lead-in. 

A brief summary: if the current character is a lead-in, the lead-in flag 
is set and control returns to the user program for the next character. If in- 
stead the character immediately follows a lead-in, then control passes to 
FNDFUN directly. Finally, if the character is neither a lead-in nor im- 
mediately follows one, it is checked for being a control character. If it is a 
control character, control goes to FNDFUN also; if it's not a control 
character, it is simply output as is. 

In the FNDFUN routine, the current character is checked against all 
nine entries in the software screen function table to see if it matches any 
of the function codes. If it doesn't, it is simply output. If a match is 
found, however, then control passes to the function-handling routine 
XFUN, at ODCOCH. It is this routine that is responsible for translating 
the software function code into its hardware equivalent and determining 
whether a hardware lead-in character is required. 

If the high bit on the hardware function code is set, then a lead-in is 
required and everything is put on hold while that lead-in is sent. Once 
that has been done, control returns to a routine called XNLDN at 
0DC23H, where the actual function code itself is processed. If no lead-in 
had been required, then control would have gone to XNLDN directly. 

In XNLDN, the function code is checked to see if it is GOTOXY. If 



LOCK-IT-UP 

DISKETTE COPY-PROTECTION 
AND DUPLICATION SYSTEMS 
FOR THE APPLE COMPUTER 

The Lock-lt-Up systems are sophisticated, menu driven 
copy-protection and duplication utilities for the Apple II 
Computer. They feature several levels of protection which 
make standard diskettes uncopyable by even the most 
sophisticated nibble copy programs currently available. 

• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Data files can be loaded and/or saved to either the protected diskette 
or an unprotected diskette. 

• Memory will be cleared and the disk will reboot if the reset key Is 
pushed. 

• The copying systems support up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data-verification is optional during copy. 

• Sequential serial numbers are assigned to each diskette produced by 
the system 

• Master diskettes created with the system contain an I.D. stamp that 
you select. The I.D. stamp must be correctly specified before any 
diskettes can be duplicated. This prevents other Lock-lt-Up owners 
from copying your diskettes. 

• Extensive support is provided should you have any problems or 
special needs. 

• Our system is supported by numerous disk copying services should 
you need a large quantity of diskettes duplicated. 

Either system is available for $225, which includes three diskettes, an 
informative manual, and a non-exclusive license to copy as many 
diskettes as needed.

it is, the counter ESCNT is set to 2 so that in the future we'll know that 
we're still processing a single function for two more characters. If it's not, 
the hardware function code is sent out as is. 

In all of the cases where we've talked about outputting the character, 
we have transferred control to a single subroutine. This routine, called 
OUTIT, at 0DC2DH, is the actual beginning of character processing; it 
is also where our output vector address is chosen. 

OUTITs very first job is to clear the ESCMSC. Since by the time we 
reach OUTIT we have the actual function character (if a screen function 
is being translated), clearing the ESCMSK is done to ensure that we con- 
tinue looking for lead-ins in the future. Next OUTIT must load the flag 
variable VECFLG and test it. If VECFLG is nonzero, then we are using 
the TTY: device and wiU output a character using the routine whose ad- 
dress is stored in Console Output Vector #1. If VECFLG is 00, on the 
other hand, we'll use Console Vector #2. 

Since UCl: is a user-implemented device, just as it was with CONIN, 
we'll examine the #1 vector in this discussion. Also, like the CONIN rou- 
tine, the CONOUT routine has its patch installed in the patch area to fix 
a problem in the original release. The address contained in the #1 vector, 
therefore, is the address of this patch routine at 0F35EH, called, 
naturally enough, OUTPAT. 

Like the other patch routines, OUTPAT was created to correct a 
problem the Z-80 has with the Apple Communications card. Basically, 
the problem results from the fact that the Z-80 does a read before every 
write. Under most circumstances this would not be a problem. How- 
ever, when dealing with certain kinds of control registers, an access of 
any kind, even a read, causes the register to change its state, lose its data, 
and so on. This is exactly what was happening in the early versions of 
SoftCard CP/M. 

To correct the situation, OUTPAT checks to see if a comm card is in- 
stalled in slot 3. If so, it checks the card's status register to determine 
whether it is able to receive a character. If it's not, OUTPAT keeps loop- 
ing and checking until the card is ready. Once OUTPAT gets an okay, it 
does the actual sending of the byte in 6502 mode, by calling STACOM, a 
very short routine at the end of OUTPAT. (We'll talk about STACOM 
in more detail later.) In this way, the write is done in 6502 mode and no 
preread takes place. 

The program flow, then, is as follows. From OUTIT, control is 
transferred to the address in Console Input Vector #1 and therefore to 
OUTPAT. OUTPAT checks slot 3 for the presence of a comm card and, 
if one is found, sends the character to it via a call to STACOM. It then 
returns to the caller, usually BDOS, for the next character. If no comm 
card is found, control proceeds to the standard TTY: output device driv- 
er, TTYOUl. 

Located at 0DC3EH, this routine contains the address, patched by 
BOOT if necessary to take into account the presence of an eighty-column 
device in slot 3. TTYOUl consists of only two instructions — the instruction 
to load register [DE] wdth 0003 (indicating slot 3) and a jump to the 
routine that will do the actual output. Initially this address is 0DC44H 
and points to a routine called WVID, designed to handle the standard 
Apple forty-column screen. 

If a card was found in slot 3, however, the address would have been 
changed to point either to WCOM at ODCDFH or to WSER at 
0DD04H for a comm card or a serial card respectively. Remember now 
that eighty-column boards are handled the same way serial cards are. 
Note also that although WCOM's address may have been placed in this 
jump instruction, OUTPAT will never let the routine get this far if a 
comm card is installed. 

At this point, then, we have our three basic routines for dealing with 
character output — WVID for Apple hardware, WSER for serial and 
eighty-column cards, and OUTPAT for comm cards. In the case of both 
serial and comm cards, no further processing needs to be done for screen 
functions. This is because external terminals are by definition capable of 
handling screen functions themselves when given the hardware function 
character and any necessary lead-in. Fortunately, eighty-column boards 
are complete in their emulation of terminals to the point that no further 
separation needs to take place for them either. The only situation in 
which we'll need to be concerned further about functions is the case of 
the Apple forty-column display, and we'll deal with that when we go 
through WVID.

For now, then, let's look briefly at the external display device rou- 
tines. We've essentially covered OUTPAT already. It loads the status 
byte from the control register at OEOBEH (the same as our discussion of 
CONIN last month) and this time checks the ready-to-transmit bit of 
this byte, bit 1 (remember, each byte is eight bits, 0 through 7, going 
through from right to left). If the bit is set, the comm card can accept a 
character; if the bit is clear, it cannot. OUTPAT will loop until this bit is 
set, at which time it will use the 6502 subroutine caller loop in the previ- 
ously discussed lOCB to set up a 6502 call to STACOM. STACOM sim- 
ply stores the character in the comm card data register at OEOBFH 
(SCOBF) and returns to OUTPAT, which then returns to BDOS. 

The process is similar for serial cards. Using the method described 
last month, WSER disables all other cards' C800 ROMs and enables the 
C800 ROM of the serial card or eighty-column board in slot 3. Data is 
then loaded into the 6502 register save locations and the page zero tem- 
poraries used by the serial card. The address of the serial card write rou- 
tine in ROM, $C9AA, is used as the 6502 subroutine address to be 
called, and the 6502 subroutine caller in the lOCB is used to execute it. 
The byte is then written to the serial card and control returns to WSER, 
which itself returns to BDOS. Basically, that's all there is to serial and 
comm card output. 

Now we'll tackle WVID, the last major section of the CONOUT 
code dealt with here. WVID first loads the memory address that corre- 
sponds to the screen location of the cursor. As you may know, the entire 
video screen is mapped into memory, such that a single character posi- 
tion on the screen corresponds to a single byte in this RAM. To alter the 
character displayed at a particular position, one only has to alter the val- 
ue of this RAM, and the video hardware takes care of printing the new 
character on-screen. Finding out which memory location corresponds to 
which screen location is a bit complicated, due to the way the screen is 
mapped into memory. There's a reasonably complete description of this 
in the Apple II Reference Manual, however, and it's a goqd source for 
further information about the arrangement. 

In standard Apple systems, most software makes use of the routines 



contained in the Apple Monitor ROM, which were designed to do all the 
necessary translation. SoftCard CP/M also makes use of these Monitor 
routines, but because some of the screen functions supported by CP/M 
are not supported by the standard Apple routines, it must also keep track 
of much of this information itself. 

The cursor address that WVID just loaded is one of those pieces of 
information it needs to keep. The cursor address is always kept in a tem- 
porary variable called CSRADR, at 0DEA5H. Since this is a sixteen-bit 
number, it is stored with the low-order byte in that address and the high- 
order byte one address beyond at 0DEA6H. 

Also stored in a temporary variable called CHRTMP, at 0DEA7H, is 
the character that's underneath the cursor at any given time. (Remem- 
ber that if no character is there, we are talking about a space.) WVID 
loads this character and then stores it at the current screen location, since 
it's most likely that we'll be moving the cursor to a different location and 
that this character will display normally from now on. 

To avoid confusion, the way the cursor is displayed on the normal 
Apple screen is by converting the existing character in that location to a 
flashing character. What happens, therefore, is that the character alter- 
nates between normal and inverse. For a space, this alternates between a 
white square block and a black square block. We can see, then, that this 
cursor is really more an imaginary point than a separate character. 
WherevCT the cursor is said to be located, the actual character value stored 
in screen RAM has been modified to represent the flashing version of the 
character, rather than the normal character value. This is also covered in 
your Apple reference manual. 

WVID, therefore, in preparing to move the cursor or print another 
character, restores the normal character value in the screen RAM at the 
current character position. At this point, WVID then calls a subroutine, 
VIDOUT, at 0DC6BH. VIDOUT's first job is to determine whether a 
screen function is being sent. If not, VIDOUT proceeds to normal out- 
put at a routine called V0UT2, at 0DC7AH. 

V0UT2 is responsible for processing carriage returns if the charac- 
ter is one. If the character is a carriage return, V0UT2 returns the cur-

sor to the b^inning of the current line by altering the cursor horizontal 
position pointer, another page zero location that is used by the Apple 
Monitor to keep track of where the cursor is on the screen. In this case, 
V0UT2 makes this value 00. Once having done that, it returns 
to WVID. 

If the character was not a carriage return, control moves to V0UT3 
at 0DC84H. V0UT3 checks to see whether it is lower case. Based on 
the result, it alters the character to upper case if necessary, unless the user 
has some type of lower-case display device in his machine. Once VOUT 
has done that, it uses the 6502 subroutine caller loop in the lOCB to call 
the character output routine in the Apple Monitor at SFDFO. Control 
returns directly to WVID in that case and the character has been printed. 

WVID will at this point simply update the variable CSRADR with 
the address of the new cursor position, taking the character now under 
the cursor in screen RAM and storing its normal value in CHRTMP. It 
will then convert this value into a flashing character, storing it in screen 
RAM so that the cursor is displayed. WVID then returns to BDOS. 

Had the character been a screen function, a different set of routines 
would have been used. If when we tested this value back in VIDOUT it 
had been a function, we would have fallen through into a routine called 
DOFUN. The DOFUN routine selects the appropriate function-han- 
dling routine from a table of address vectors. 

In reality, to conserve space, this table, called CTRLJP, from 
0DCD5H through ODCDEH, consists only of the addresses of each of 
the separate function routines. Making sure that all of these routines and 
the table are in the same memory page (that is, sharing the same high- 
order address byte) ensures that only the low-order byte will be needed 
to find the various routines. DOFUN loads the [HL] register with the 
address of the beginning of the table and then simply indexes to the de- 
sired entry based on the function number, 0 through 8. Once it has found 
the entry, it loads the low-order byte into [L], thereby pointing [HL] at 
the address of the function-handling routine. 

All that's required to perform the Lo-Lite and Hi-Lite functions is to 
store the appropriate value (OFFH for normal or 3FH for inverse) into 
the page zero temporary variable at $32 that subsequent character out- 
put will use to make these characters display either normal or inverse. 
Once this is done, control returns to WVID. The Cursor Forward func- 
tion is performed by a Monitor routine at $FBF4; Clear to End of Screen 
by the Monitor routine at $FC43; Clear to End of Line by the Monitor 
routine at $FC9C; Cursor Up by the Monitor at $FClA; and linefeed by 
the Monitor at $FC58. 

Each of these function routines sets its individual Monitor routine 
address and then makes use of the 6502 subroutine caller loop, with con- 
trol returning to WVID at completion. The Home Cursor routine does 
much the same thing but must first set the cursor horizontal and cursor 
vertical position pointers in page zero locations $24 and $25. It then calls 
the Monitor routine, which recalculates the cursor position with respect 
to screen RAM. The Apple 11 Reference Manual describes the activity of 
this routine, referring to the routine as BASCALC. 

The final function routine we want to cover here is GOTOXY. As we 
said in our earlier discussion of TTY0U2, once the lead-in character and 
GOTOXY function code have been sent, we need to get the next two val- 
ues (row and column) before we can actually perform the function. This is 
done from within TTY0U2 if we do not go to NOESC. Essentially, 
TTY0U2 is responsible for obtaining the other two values by continuing 
to return to BDOS until the last two are received. As they are found, 
TTYOU2 stores them in temporary locations, where they will be used by 
the actual function-handling routine. 

Once all values are in, TTYOU2 calls OUTIT itself with a special 
screen function value. OUTIT then processes this value in the normal 
way and proceeds to that entry in the function table. The GOTOXY 
function handler then uses the values in the temporaries to reset the verti- 
cal and horizontal position pointers to the appropriate numbers for that 
row and column, and calls the Monitor BASCALC routine to do the ac- 
tual positioning. 

This has been a complex discussion. In the future, as we discuss 
alterations to these routines, what's going on should become somewhat 
more transparent. Reading the Apple II Reference Manual section on this 
subject will also help. Until next month. ... 31

First row: Pigeon's eye view of tlie packed convention floor from the rafters. National Cash Register hucksters touted their new personal 
computer entrant. Second row: Steady rains didn't deter computerists, as this long line waiting to enter the exhibition shows. The man who 
started it all, Gary Kildall, gave an overview of CP/M, past, present, and future. The Digital Research booth was front and center, both in 
terms of location and interest. Third row: Interested spectator was VisiCalc creator Dan Bricklin. Retailers with Apples and Ataris on hand 
had the most popular displays for the younger set. Master promoter Jerry Milden set all kinds of world records for attendance at a first-time 
show with this effort. 



Surprising -was the first word of exhibitors and attendees at the 
CP/M '83 show held January 21 through 23 at the underground 
Moscone Center in San Francisco. The show, sponsored by 
CP/M maker Digital Research, was a surprise on several levels. 

The biggest surprise was the attendance. Despite rain and the 
threat of a major storm, thousands more people than hoped for 
showed up to tackle more than two hundred booths and three 
days of workshops, software spotlights, and discussions. 

The second surprise of the show was the number of non- 
CP/M users in attendance, lured by the display of more than forty 
different kinds of CP/M-compatible computers all under one 
roof, catering to both business and personal needs. Business ap- 
plications were the main thrust of the exhibits. 



The huge influx of people who didn't even own a computer, 
who were "just looking," was the third surprise of the event. Apples 
and the IBM pc were their top choices. Staffers in the So/talk 
booth tirelessly pointed the way to the nearest Apple on the floor. 

Apple Computer didn't have a booth, but the new He was well 
represented by several retail exhibitors. The name Lisa buzzed 
through the crowd, as the name of any new star would be gossiped 
about at an industry event — no surprise to anyone. 

A touch of irony came from Time magazine, which ran a pic- 
ture of Digital Research founder and CP/M designer Gary Kil- 
dall enthusiastically playing on the CP/M-less Lisa. The photo 
was on the newsstands the same week the CP/M '83 show was at- 
tempting to forward Kildall's own brainchild.

e¥fery Interesting Effects 



BV AHDREW (HWSTIE 



How does a young man with artistic ambitions and a background in 
English hterature pursue a hi-tech dream? 

Howard Shore was a teenager with a yen for science fiction when he 
first read about lasers in Scientific American in the late 1960s. It was love 
at first sight. His growing fascination with discrete frequencies of coher- 
ent visible radiation found its first outlet in a 1976 holography class at the 
University of California at Los Angeles. This led to his development of 
the world's first holographic wristwatch— just on the verge of the price 
plunge for all LED products. He wound up with a lot of unique watches 
that he would have had to have sold for less than the manufacturing 
cost. Alas. 

His break came in 1980 when a friend got him a job with David L. 
Wolper on the film The Man Who Saw Tomorrow, using lasers to repre- 
sent atomic missiles in the movie's Armageddon finale. 

A Fateful Meeting. On his way at last, Shore proceeded to buy up 
electronic equipment and lasers from auctions and surplus stores. One 
day he ran into a man with a laser for sale, for which someone else had 
already offered a fair sum. Shore offered more, and the seller said he'd 
get back to him. The next day, Shore found that his competitor had been 
back in the interim and offered still more. The seller had no complaints, 
but for Shore it was somewhat exasperating. 

"Listen," he said, "I'm going to have this laser, but you've got to sell 
it to me now, and you've got to give me the other guy's name and phone 
number." 

The deal was closed. Shore called up "the other guy," one Todd Eliot 
Mahon, and said, "I own the laser, I needed it very much, but I don't 
need it all the time. Could you use it half the time?" Mahon agreed, the 
two split the purchase price, and each gave the other free time on their 



mutual laser. While they were at it, they decided to give their partnership 
a name. Thus was Bifrost Technical Effects born. 

Shore had heard that lasers could be linked to computers, and was 
taking a computer class at a local college "just in case" he might need it. 
He did. Todd Mahon's expertise in digital electronics allowed him to en- 
ter the name of a client onto a PROM, and thus write the words in laser 
light. Realizing the market potential of what they had, Mahon and Shore 
sold an Argentine company on the idea, used the profits to buy an Ap- 
ple and attendant hardware, and called in Apple programmer Eric Pope- 
joy to assist in the design of the Apple Lasergraph. 

The Creative Process. Working in tandem, Popejoy and Mahon be- 
gan development of software that would create and store an image on 
the Apple and then translate it into laser light. The two engaged in a 
friendly competition; as Shore would come up with a new "wouldn't-it- 
be-neat" idea, Popejoy would say, "Yeah, I can do that," and Mahon 
would race to complete the necessary wiring to take Popejoy's signal. 
Shore recalls that it was "like conducting a duet of two Spocks in a Vul- 
can orchestra." 

When they finished, they had the basis for Bifrost's present-day sys- 
tem: an Apple, a beam console, and a bit graphics tablet with software 
that stores points — up to 1 ,000 per image — as x,y coordinates, runs a dis- 
play program, and loads up to ten images into the computer. Hitting a 
key sends the coordinates to a Mountain Computer digital/analog con- 
verter, converting them to voltages that are transmitted to the tiny gal- 
vanometer-mounted mirrors of the laser beam head. The beam, now 
fraught with computer image, hits a prism and is bounced to mirror z be- 
fore it has a chance to break up into colors; mirror z shines onto mirror 
X, which picks up horizontal deflections and passes the beam to mirror y 



Opposite page: A krypton laser struts its stuff, 
guided by an Apple II Plus and fueled by the

engineering skills of Todd Elliot Mahon (above 
right). The result is a Bifrost production— named 
for the rainbow bridge between Earth and 
Asgard. 




for vertical deflections. The beam is then ready to carry its image onto a 
screen or into space. 

Potentiometers on an interface box are read by the DAC (faster than 
joysticks or paddles) and allow for simple animation and the addition of 
external signals; a circle drawn on the graphics tablet can be reproduced 
in shimmering green laser light; then, a function generator, working like 
a synthesizer/oscillator, can put an analog square wave across the circle 
and modulate the outside rim to give a starburst effect. Mahon designed 
an inverter circuit that can cause the image to rotate. 

The system enabled Shore to give shape and form to the visions that 



Is this a system? An

converter, interface 
box, and function

danced in his head when he opened that fateful copy of Scientific Ameri- 
can: "When we get an image we like, we save it; when we get ten images 
we like, we run our All program and give them a sequence name. We can 
adjust the speed of the computer, causing animation routines; we can 
command the image to draw, erase, erase from back. 

"Once the image is digitized, we can display it as laser light, stick the 
z axis on a sine wave, and use special filters. By the time we're done, 
we've modified the image three different ways, giving us a lot to play with 
in the tape editing." 

Finicky. With lasers, the name of the game is alignment. The mir- 




rmr 



189 



rors must be in the proper relation to each other, and the necessary ad- 
justments are measured in microns. But they are done by hand. As 
Mahon puts it, "Sometimes you just drop a new mirror in and it works; 
sometimes you drop it in and there's a Httle piece of dust or something in 
there and it doesn't seat properly. You throw the beam out in different 
directions and rock the beam around. . . . You make a sort of raster scan 
to try to find the alignment." 

The Apple alone can give any signal necessary to run the laser. Look- 
ing at the laser interpretation of an Apple graphics tablet can get boring, 
however; that's why Bifrost installed all the extra hardware. 

"Ultimately," says Shore, "we'd like to videotape a live scene, enter 
the tape into the computer frame by frame and save the image to disk, 
convert it to x,y coordinates for vector display as laser light, then retape it 
and remix the results with the tape of the original scene." 

If you present that scenario to people who know about these things, 
they will reply with a succinct, "No way." Shore admits it will be "pain- 
ful," but with an image buffer of appropriate size he is confident that it 
can be done. 

The Future Is Vet To Come. So far, Bifrost's efforts have ranged 
from television commercials to live performances at clubs and parties in 
the Los Angeles area. Their videotape production, "Alon," is an exam- 
ple of the direction they'd like to go with lasers. Eventually, with the right 
backers, the company hopes to experiment with Apple/motion-control 
camera technology, possibly using Shore and Mahon's laser expertise for 
range finding and sighting. 

But Todd Mahon is considering another possibility "With a faster 
computer, we could alter the image mathematically. If you know a spe- 
cific number of points in the image, you can draw another image using 
the same number of points, and plot a line going from one point to the 
corresponding point on the other image. Then every point has a line to 
which it must go to get to the next shape; you can draw a picture and 
blend it into another one. It looks Hke animation." 

And Bifrost Technical Effects is off and dreaming. JM

PINBALL INDUSTRY SEES 
THE WRITING ON THE WALL 



The pinball machine won't be around for 
you to tilt much longer. The celebrated pas- 
time of hoods and punks is dying out in the 
arcades of America. The sounds of springing 
flippers kicking steel balls into alleys, banging 
them into bumpers, and zooming them 
around hairpin curves have been replaced by 
the explosions, tick-tick-ticks, and infectious 
tunes of video games across the country. 

Three years ago, more than two hundred 
thousand pinball machines were sold nation- 
wide — an all-time record. But sales plunged to 
thirty-three thousand in 1982, prompting 
Stem Electronics, one of the big four manu- 
facturers, to stop production. 

Gary Stem, president of the company, 
says, "We have streamlined ourselves as a vid- 
eo company, concentrating on video games." 
Berserk, Scramble, Cobra, and the new Bag- 
man are a few of its electronic offerings. 

Bally, Williams, and Gottlieb — the other 
three major manufacturers — have cut pro- 
duction sharply. "Pinball machines are ex- 
pensive, labor-intensive games that are trou- 



ble for an operator. They're more prone to 
break down and don't earn as much as the 
video games," says Stern. 

Today, video games dominate the mar- 
ketplace, accounting for 87 percent of the $8.9 
billion in commercial game sales last year, ac- 
cording to Play Meter magazine, an industry 
publication. 

"People today are taken with comput- 
ers," says Stem. "It's even happening to me — 
and I was raised on pinball. I don't enjoy pin- 
ball as much anymore. When I go to a trade 
show I see pinball games and I don't even play 
them. There is just so much more you can do 
with a video game today — such incredible 
graphics." 

Harry Williams, the seventy-six-year-old 
inventor of the electric pinball machine, has 
seen the birth and demise of the game. "We're 
in the novelty business," says the founder of 
Williams Manufacturing. "And novelty 
means one thing — sooner or later you get tired 
of the novelty of it."

FAIRE 
TIME! 

Shine up your roller skates, lock up your 
plastic, and get ready for three days of com- 
puter madness. It's time for the Eighth West 
Coast Computer Faire in San Francisco. 

Every size and shape of microcomputer, 
every kind of software, and every possible 
computer-related trinket and souvenir will be 
on display and for sale March 18-20 at Brooks 
Hall in San Francisco's Civic Auditorium. If 
you've never attended one of these gargan- 
tuan affairs, do not take these warnings 
lightly. 

The promoter. Computer Faire, in Wood- 
side, California, is predicting attendance of 
anywhere from thirty thousand to fifty thou- 
sand. There'll be approximately seven hun- 
dred exhibitors; space reservations were filled 
by the middle of December. 

Only three-day tickets are available; 
they're $15. The fair is so big, according to the 
promoters, that it's impossible to see the 
whole thing in one day. Unlike the recent 
Applefests, the West Coast Computer Faire 
will feature its usual well-rounded offering of 
conferences and presentations. The confer- 
ences run all three days and overlap, so you'll 
have to be choosy. 

The fair is open from 9:00 a.m. till 6:00 
p.m. all three days. Attendees can pay at the 
door, but may have to wait in line. 

Last year's West Coast Computer Faire 
was even better than the previous year's. The 
number of Apple-oriented products was 
mind-boggling. It'll be interesting to see if 
some of the personal computers that have ap- 
peared in the last twelve months show prom- 
ise of commanding similarly enthusiastic sup- 
port from independent software publishers. 

Nevertheless, it's recommended that any 
Apple owners in the Bay Area during the third 
week of March gorge themselves at this three- 
day microcomputer feast. You won't be sorry, 
though your feet may be sore come Sunday 
afternoon.

IBM Fellow Computes Fractal Geometry 

Creates New 
Branch of 
Mathematics 



A perfect circle does not occur in nature. 
Nor does a perfect square, a perfect triangle, 
or a perfect dodecahedron. The sloppy com- 
position of the natural world has never had 
much of a place in the rarefied theoretical at- 
mosphere of pure mathematics. 

And yet, out of the seeming chaos of the 
randomly occurring shapes so much in vogue 
when the world was new, an order has now 
been wrought. Dr. Benoit Mandelbrot's Frac- 
tal Geometry of Nature (W. H. Pressman, San 
Francisco, 1982) takes sets of irregular or frag- 
mented shapes and groups them into families, 
deriving mathematical theories therefrom. 

Inside a mainframe computer, this means 
that randomly generated numbers can be 
made to correspond to the irregularities of a 
natural surface. Given this and a little color in- 
formation, the computer fills in the details. 
The results, seen here, are pretty spectacular. 

Mandelbrot, an IBM Fellow at the 
Thomas J. Watson Research Center in York- 
town Heights, New York, has used the com- 
puter to create a new branch of mathematics. 
As he recalls, "Previously, natural shapes 
could be broken down into two categories: 
those one can tackle by the ordinary geome- 
try of smooth shapes and those too compli- 
cated to be tackled geometrically. Between the 
two, I identified a new class of shapes that are 
complicated but whose complication is man- 
ageable. To everyone's surprise, many frac-

perception of what mountains 
are, but the utilization of a 
theory," with the assistance of

planetrise by Voss and Dr. 
Benoit Mandeibrot. Lower left,

aggregate of infinite curves. 




tals have also turned out to be extremely beau- 
tiful." 

A fractal "dragon," seen on a computer 
with near-infinite resolution and magnified to 
a near-infinite degree, would not reveal great- 
er simplification with enlargement, but great- 
er complexity. These are the proposed shapes 
of non-Euclidean geometry — curves of infi- 
nite length or with infinite branching points — 
that were known as monsters by mathemati- 
cians because they were not demonstrable. 

The graphic demonstration of fractals — 
showing beyond all argument that they do in- 
deed exist — has greatly aided Mandelbrot and 
his associate at IBM, Dr. Richard Voss, in 
finding acceptance of the monsters in acade- 
mia. He also found that the ability to see a 
fractal suggested modifications to his theo- 
ries, and the whole process became interac- 
tive. "Every improvement in graphics ushered 
in a further step in the theory, and the merits 



of the theory led to much faster development 
of the graphics." 

The new field is moving at least as fast as 
the computer industry. "The book came out a 
few months ago, but it was already out of date 
a year ago," says Mandelbrot, who also notes 
that the wide dissemination of his work prob- 
ably had little to do with the elegance of his 
equations. 

"I was planning to just make a good pic- 
ture of a mathematical theory, and to our sur- 
prise and great pleasure the illustrations were 
. . . aesthetically satisfactory. The publisher 
thinks that for each person who buys the book 
for the science, nine people are buying it for 
the pictures." 

Mandelbrot is content in the knowledge 
that he has forced an esoteric branch of 
mathematics into the area of concrete, intui- 
tive problems "that a child can understand but 
science could not tackle."

Software and Video Games Galore 

80,000 AHEND WINTER CES 



We have seen the future and the future is 
the past. 

If the Winter Consumer Electronics Show 
(CES), held this January in Las Vegas, had a 
message for the world of software, it was that 
to survive in the world of big business one has 
to have a name, any name, as long as it has a 
past. It seemed as if every movie of any sig- 
nificance (and some of little or no signifi- 
cance) from the past twenty years is now a vid- 
eo game. The licensing of movie titles seemed 
to be the order of the day at this show, which 
was otherwise dominated by software of every 
conceivable description. 

The sales pitch varied from innuendo to 
the time-honored technique of sensory over- 
load. Parker Brothers showed clips from the 
James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret 
Service and scenes from the upcoming Star 
Wars sequel Return of theJedi as teasers for its 
new line of software for both video game ma- 
chines and microcomputers. Visitors to the 
Parker Brothers booth didn't get to see much 
in the way of actual computer software, but 
the message was clear: Parker Brothers wants 
to penetrate the market via the vehicle of li- 
censed movie titles converted into arcade 
games. Only time will tell if the games, none of 
which were available for play, can match the 
success of the movies upon which they are 
based. 

On the other side of the movie license vid- 
eo game spectrum, seemingly far removed 
from agent 007 and Luke Skywalker, were the 
forthcoming VCS horror movie games. Two 
titles in evidence were The Texas Chainsaw 
Massacre and Halloween from Wizard Video 
Games. In each of those games, the player can 
be a psychopathic murderer chasing comput- 
er or player-controlled prey; or the player can 
be a victim pursued by another player or the 
computer. Attendees were treated to some of 
the original films' bloodier moments on vid- 
eotape as promotion for the games. The 
games themselves were unfinished, but 
enough of the graphics were done to give 
showgoers a taste of the mayhem to come. 

But movie titles weren't the only things to 
emerge as possible video game spin-offs. Tele- 
vision characters, cartoon characters both 
from TV and the daily newspapers, puppets, 
and rock groups were all in attendance as col- 
lections of pixels on the magic screen. The 
message was clear big money has arrived in 
the software business, and the need to make 
one's presence felt has resulted in a loss of 
faith in the virtues of originality. Sigh. 

There were also some new kids on the mi- 
crocomputer block, along with some new toys 
from old hands in the neighborhood. Spectra 
Video unveiled a 32K RAM/32K ROM Z-80 
based microcomputer geared toward the game 
player. Mattel unveiled its new Aquarius 



home computer complete with a full line of 
peripherals. Mattel's booth, one of the largest 
at the show, was the site of much curiosity, as 
new games were revealed for the Apple, Atari, 
and IBM personal computers. There was also 
a new version of Mattel's game machine — the 
Intellivision II, at half the size of the original 
with essentially the same features. (An Intelli- 
vision III is rumored to be in the works.) A 
new keyboard unit that connects to the Intel- 
livision II was also shown. 

Timex showed its latest offering, the 
Timex/Sinclair 2000, to selected buyers, while 
Texas Instruments showed off its new TI 99/2 
micro. Atari also quietly showed off its latest 
microcomputer offering, the Atari 1200 — a 
more powerful version of the 800, with 
redesigned keyboard and peripherals. 

Video technology was in abundance at the 
show, although few if any startling break- 
throughs were in evidence. Videodiscs had a 
lot of support, with many new entertainment 
offerings released, and a surprising number of 
videodisc players were present. Showgoers 
walking from the Las Vegas Hilton to the 
main exhibit hall had to wend their way 
through a veritable forest of satellite dishes in 
the parking lot. Backyard-receiving-station 
prices have come down considerably and the 
result is that new companies and their wares 
popped up like so many mushrooms in the 
desert sun. 

Unlike previous CES shows, this one had 
a number of microcomputer software compa- 
nies in attendance. Old friends such as Broder- 
bund, Datasoft, Synapse, and Epyx (Auto- 
mated Simulations) showed up to exhibit their 
products and talk to the buyers and mass mer- 
chandisers. DataMost used the show to an- 
nounce a venture into the Atari market, the 
signing of new titles, and to let the world 
know of their merger with an East Coast firm. 
Sirius Software was also present with a whole 
slew of new titles and pushed their new Atari 
cartridges. 

The Winter CES show was one of the larg- 
est ever, with nearly eighty thousand attend- 
ees from all segments of the electronics world. 
The convention was so large this year that the 
show was held in three sites simultaneously. 
This meant that attendees — even those who 
successfully resisted the gaming tables — could 
spend all three days there and never even see 
some parts of the show. 

Yet software clearly held sway this year. 
Between the mad scramble to grab a spot in the 
home-video-game market and the at- 
tempts of some larger concerns to cash in on 
the microcomputer boom, the main exhibi- 
tion hall was filled with the buzzes, squeaks, 
clicks, and roars of computer games. Perhaps 
the only louder sounds were those of deals be- 
ing made.

Multi-State Computer System 
Lights Up When Lightning Striices 



A computerized lightning detection sys- 
tem is playing a major role in dramatically re- 
ducing fire-fighting costs on federal lands. 

When the Bureau of Land Management 
initiated its pilot program in 1977, the agen- 
cy's fire suppression outlays stood at $24 mil- 
lion. Last year, they were hovering around $8 
million. 



Fifty-five percent of all bureau fires are ac- 
tually started by bolts from the blue. The de- 
tection system, the brainchild of BLM's Den- 
ver office and the University of Arizona, pin- 
points lightning strikes in the eleven western 
states and Alaska, giving fire-fighters the jump 
on potential trouble spots.

sors or direction finders relay the information 
to position analyzers, which plot the latitude 
and longitude of the strike. That signal is 
whisked to an Intel 8080 microprocessor in 
the bureau's western regional nerve center in 
Boise, Idaho, then back to a local BLM office 
and a Hewlett-Packard 9845T minicomput- 
er — all within a second. 

A flashing "X" on an HP monitor display 
map marks the spot of the strike. During one 
six-hour period last year, more than sevoiteen 
hundred strikes in the Lake Tahoe region 
flashed on the monitor of lightning detection 
technician Marj Andreco. Andreco works out 
of BLM's Sacramento, California, office. By 
stroking a key, Andreco can get an instant 
printout of a map of California with Xs mark- 
ing the lightning strikes. These are followed by 
listings of the time, latitude, and longitude of 
each strike. Andreco then sends helicopter and 
reconnaissance pilots to investigate. 

The Automatic Lightning Detection Sys- 
tem will eventually be merged with a Remote 
Automatic Weather Station, says Andreco. By 
combining weather reports with lightning 
strikes, fire investigators will be able to rank 
fire probabilities and conduct their air search- 
es accordingly. 

The bureau's overall system includes thirty 
lightning sensors, which have a two-hundred 
mile range, and twelve position analyzers. An- 
dreco pegs the cost of installing and main- 
taining the California component at around 
two hundred thousand dollars, but adds, 
"This system pays for itself many times over 
each year."

PINBALL INDUSTRY 



continued from page 191 

Pinball was invented in the Depression era 
of the thirties, when you could get seven balls 
for a penny. The first commercially successful 
game was Baffle Ball by Gottlieb, a strictly 
mechanical device released in 1931. Williams 
revolutionized the business when he added 
electricity to the game for faster play with the 
release of Contact in 1932. He sold twenty- 
three thousand of the games for seventy-five 
dollars each. By 1935, more than eighty pin- 
ball manufacturers had entered the make-or- 
break pinball market, some lasting less than 
thirty days. 

Many of the early games paid off winners 
(slot machines, for example), while others paid 
high scorers with free games. The cash pay- 
offs are what linked the pinball industry to 
gambling and the mob, a connection they 
weren't able to shake for decades. Legend has 
it that in the early days of the game an execu- 
tive of Murder Inc. was lashed to a pinball 
machine and dropped into a lake in the Cat- 
skills for attempting to cheat his partners out 
of pinball revenues. 

The games' spreading underworld noto- 
riety led New York Mayor Fiorello La 
Guardia personally to sledgehammer confis- 
cated pinball machines in the late thirties. By 
1942 they had been banned in New York 



City — Los Angeles had already banned them 
in 1939. 

It was thirty-five years later, in 1974, that 
the Los Angeles ban was lifted by the Califor- 
nia Supreme Court in a landmark decision. 
Lawyers and representatives of the manufac- 
turers played pinball in front of judges to 
prove they were games of skill and not chance. 

The same year. Bally introduced the tran- 
sistorized game with advanced circuitry that 
allowed digital scoring and futuristic sound ef- 
fects. The Who and their rock opera Tommy 
helped catapult pinball gaming to its greatest 
popularity in the middle to late seventies. 
Games got more complex, art got more 
risque, and the buzzers and bells got louder. 

Also in 1974, the black-and-white video 
game Pong was introduced. Who knew? 

Pinball had managed to survive the chal- 
lenge of competing games such as air hockey 
and foosball, but the video revolution proved 
the final blow, much to the surprise of the in- 
dustry. 

Space Invaders, Asteroids, and Pac-Man 
soon came crunching into the arcades like 
monsters. "It was very frightening to me," 
says Williams, who was working as a private 
consultant. 'T knew we had to make superior 
games." But the pinball game became old hat 
by 1981 — ironically, the year after the biggest 
twelve-month sales period the half-century-old 
industry had ever had.

GAME PROGRAMMERS COMPETE IN TOURNEY 

Companies Send 
Their Best to 
Las Vegas Event 

Who is the best microcomputer game 
player of all? And how does one go about 
finding out? One holds a tournament, of 
course! And one limits the contestants to 
those whom one can reasonably assume are 
among the best players: the game program- 
mers themselves. 

At least that's what Software Distributors 
did, for the first annual Wizard versus the 
Wizards personal computer game world 
championships, held December 3 at the Sands 
Hotel in Las Vegas. 

Atari pulled their sponsorship of the tour- 
nament only two days before the event. Tour- 
nament officials had to go out and buy twelve 
Ataris, while nonsponsor-turned-sponsor 
Apple donated twelve Apple lis the same day, 
even though the majority of games planned 
were for the Atari. 

And so they came, the top microcom- 
puter arcade hackers in the country: Steve 
Bjork and Gerry "Clowns and Balloons" 
Humphrey from Datasoft; Joe "Wizard of 
Wor" Hellesen from Roklan; Ken "Thresh- 
old" Williams and Chuck "Chuckles" 
Beuche from Sierra On- Line; Dan "Twerps" 
Thompson and Mark "Sneakers" Turmell 
from Sirius; Russ "Preppie" Wetmore from 
Adventure International; Jay "Pig Pen" Zip- 
nick, Peter "Night Raiders" Filiberti, and 
Bob "Thief Flanagan from DataMost; and 
Jim "Microwave" Nitchals, free-lance game- 
grammer. 

For the preliminary rounds, the twelve 
contestants played twelve different games, 
with one five-minute round allotted for each 
game. At the completion of each game the 
players were ranked by highest scores, as tabu- 
lated on a DEC Rainbow. The winner was 
awarded one point, second place received two 
points, and so on. At the completion of the 
preliminary rounds the four players with the 
lowest award-points totals qualified for the 
semifinals. 

The four semifinalists played three more 
games under the same scoring procedure, and 
the two players with the lowest award-point 
totals went head to head for the champion- 
ship. The games for the final play-off were 
chosen at random by the DEC Rainbow and 
were not a product of either player's com- 
pany. The finals lasted three and a half min- 
utes per game for three games; the best two 
out of three scores won. 

Obviously no one went for monster high 
scores here. Winning strategies were those that 



got the player through the game fastest, like 
selectively shooting for only the highest-scor- 
ing targets and bonuses. 

Halfway through, the shakeout was fairly 
complete, and everyone could see the writing 
on the monitor. 

"There's no way we can't take first or 
second," said Sirius team coach Jerry Jewell, 
"unless the competition behind us scores first 
and second for the next five games. As pro- 
grammers, Thompson and Turmell have eight 
or ten games under their belts; most of the 
authors here have only written a couple of 
games. . . . Ken Williams would be the excep- 
tion to that." 

He need not have worried. The Sierra On- 
Line axis ran out of steam, leaving the field 
clear for the Sirius machine of Thompson and 
Turmell, who traded off first and second place 
all the way to the end of the preliminary 
rounds. 

For the semifinals, it was Thompson and 
Turmell, Russ Wetmore, and Jim Nitchals, 
who came on strong after a slow start. 
Thompson quickly established dominance, 
clobbering the competition on the first game; 
but Nitchals broke through to place second on 
the other two games, acing out Turmell for a 
place in the finals. 

The outcome of the finals was to be kept a 
secret, so the airing of the tournament on tele- 
vision sometime in April yvould be suspense- 
ful. Separate line feeds to monitors backstage 
were attached to the computers and duct tape 
was applied to the scoreboard areas of each 
screen in hopes of keeping the audience in 
the dark. 

But the secret wasn't to be. The pot at the 
end of the Rainbow clearly wasn't meant for 
Nitchals as it randomly chose three games in 
which he had been weaker in the preliminary 
rounds. 

"I knew he had me beat," Nitchals re- 



flected afterward, but he pressed on gamely. 

Thompson and Nitchals were never more 
than a hundred or so points apart during play, 
but Nitchals made a fatal error on the second 
game, reaching "game over" before the end of 
the round, while Thompson continued to play 
clear to the next level. Nitchals seemed unable 
to shake the gaffe, and blew the last exercise in 
the same way, leaving no doubt in the minds 
of everyone present as to the final outcome. 

When the dust cleared, Chris Daly of Soft- 
ware Distributors presented cash, checks, 
Amdek monitors, and Wico, TG, and Kraft 
joysticks to both finalists, with the winner's 
prize including a DEC Rainbow and even- 
tually amounting to $10,000, plus extras. Then 
all contestants slipped up to the producer's 
suite to don inflatable suits and bounce 
around on air jets. 

Night fell on Las Vegas. No one stopped 
playing games.

Sculptor Uses 
Computer To 
Design Works 

Art was once a lot easier for Frank Smul- 
lin. At the end of his college years, he aban- 
doned his plans for a career in biophysiology 
and became a sculptor. He started out in the 
sixties, firmly in the figurative, realistic school, 
but soon gravitated to abstract forms, usually 
networks of cylinders. The networks got 
bigger and more complex, and Frank decided 
it was time to employ the services of a 
computer. 

As sculptor-in-residence at Duke Univer- 
sity, he had access to an Amdahl mainframe 
and IBM 360 in the university's computa- 
tions center. A student assistant would take an 
algorithm Smullin developed for a sculpture and 
write a Basic program. "I conceive of them as fat 
vectors" (a vector with a radius), says Smullin. 

At least it was easy until his assistant grad- 
uated. Smullin then taught himself PL/ 1. Pro- 
gramming his own sculptures made him much 
more adventurous. "When I was asking a pro- 
grammer to do these things for me I was al- 
ways very reluctant to ask for subtle changes. I 
didn't realize you could just slip in there and 
substitute a line." 

With his new programming freedom, the 
logistics of his sculptures grew in complexity, 
as did his program requirements. "I was 
working with alphanumeric data; I wasn't get- 
ting patterns or doing plotting," he explains. 
"My knowledge of the sculpture was entirely 
in terms of parameter fitting. I would ask the 
computer about the proximity of one part to 
another and it would tell me about parts in 
collision." The last work Smullin attempted 
"flying blind" in this fashion was Labyrinth of 
Datalist, constructed from a wire model, using 
the computer to juggle the data to make the 
parts fit and join the ends of the mitered cylin- 
ders snugly. 

The experience was an arduous one, and it 
convinced him to explore the graphic possi- 
bilities of computer-aided design. In his initial 
foray into mainframe graphic software he util- 
ized Tectronics plot- 10 terminal control rou- 
tines and a Calcomp plotter. 

"I blew my year's budget in one month 
and went into hock to get a show ready," he 
recalls. Convinced of the fiscal impracticality 
of his situation, he commenced rewriting eve- 
rything in Basic for the Tectronics 4052 in 
Duke's chemistry department. When he got 
the plot- 10 routines working, Labyrinth of 
Datalist was the first sculpture he plotted out. 
To aid the eye in discerning which trans- 
parent-seeming pipes were going where, he 
shaded the final results by hand, because he 
had no hidden line routine. ("I used an arm- 
strong routine with a colored pencil inter- 
face.")

Just as when he had learned how to pro- 
gram, the advent of the current generation of 
powerful microcomputers gave Smullin a 
new range of freedom and possibilities. Hav- 
ing begun work in the spring of 1982 on a 
CAD/CAM system that will run in a 32 K en- 
vironment, Smullin is now rewriting it to run 
on the Vectorgraphics Vector-4 terminal, 
taking advantage of that machine's raster 
screen and storage advantages over the Tec- 
tronics. For Smullin, micros meant "com- 



plete liberation. Free time is a wonderful 
thing. I didn't have to be concerned about eve- 
ry unsuccessful compile costing me $10." 

Gradually, computers have altered Frank 
SmuUin's creative process. Initially, he had to 
make wire models and digitize the coordi- 
nates. Before he had graphic output, he had to 
work with geometrical concepts where it was 
impossible to keep the form clearly in mind. 
Today, it's possible for him to go in with the 
most general idea of what he wants to make 



and watch it materialize step by step, seeing 
the image continuously drawn on the screen 
and pressing the appropriate menu key to 
make a change. Instead of using hidden line 
removal, he produces stereoscopic plots, train- 
ing himself so that his right eye looks at the 
left image and his left eye looks at the slightly 
rotated right image, giving a three-dimension- 
al sense of where things are in space. 

"My goal is to create a system that allows 
me to manipulate a network of mitered cylin- 
ders with the plasticity of modeling in clay. 
Each time I want to make a new sculpture, I 
find I want to manipulate it in a way I haven't 
done before. When I was clay modeling or 
carving wood, I would often find I needed a 
different kind of tool, and I would go reforge 
a gouge or fit whatever I had to whatever I 
wanted it to do. I'm always going back and re- 
forging tools, and I find I do the same thing 
with the computer."

Mind Your j" 





By PETER OLIVIERI 




A sincere thank-you to all of those readers, known affectionately as 
B.U.G.s, who have written in to share both their problems and their 
expertise. As you may recall, a letter from a reader asking for help with a 
printer problem was included in a recent column. The response from 
fellow B.U.G.s was overwhelming and a solution to the problem ap- 
pears this month. It seems to happen just this way with many of our 
reader requests. The willingness to take the time to write a note to help 
someone else out is admirable. If this column simply provided such a 
forum for assisting one another, it would certainly be a success. 

By the way, if your letter doesn't appear in this column, don't fret. All 
of the letters are read: if you take the time to write them, we take the time 
to read them. Whatever you do, don't stop writing. Your voice, your 
opinion, matters. 

So many letters are coming in that we may have to hold a B.U.G. 
convention one of these days. Can't you just see the headlines — B.U.G.s 
Meeting in Hawaii. 

The New Kid on the Block. Apple has announced its new business 
computer. Lisa, as it is affectionately named, sounds like quite a 
machine. 

The Lisa sells for about $10,000. It comes with an integrated pack- 
age of programs, including a spreadsheet, two graphics programs, a 
word processing program, a database management system, and a proj- 
ect management program. Because the programs are "integrated," they'll 
be especially easy to use. In fact, ease of use seems to be the hallmark of 
this new machine. 

The Lisa also comes equipped with a mouse, a device not unlike a 
joystick that allows the user to move an arrow around the screen to select 
items. This means that the user will be required to do less typing. The 
Lisa is very often set up to communicate with the business user by means 
of graphics. For example, when you want access to information in a par- 
ticular database, you might use the mouse to point to a picture of a file 
cabinet. 

The new machine has one megabyte of main memory, two built-in 
floppy disk drives (each allowing for 871 K of additional storage), and a 
detachable keyboard with numeric keypad. 

The Lisa has the potential to be one of the most exciting computers 
available to the business user. Consider this only a brief preview; more 
information should be available soon. 

VisiCalc Users. As you probably know, a new 128K RAM version 
of VisiCalc is now available for your Apple II. In addition to the stan- 
dard VisiCalc features you all know and love, the new version provides 
various new capabilities. It allows you to protect selected cells so that 
their contents can't be accidentally erased, and allows you to "hide" se- 
lected cells in order to build confidential information into a model and 
prevent it from being seen by unauthorized users. It also gives you var- 
iable column widths (a capability long sought after by many users), an 
expanded, easier-to-use replicate command, full financial capabilities 
(including internal rates of return), on-screen help messages that can be 
activated with a single keystroke, and easy multisheet consolidation. 

Enough? Nope! VisiCalc Advanced Version does even more. Users 
now get much more formatting capability; new features include justifica- 
tion and centering, a floating dollar sign, a percent sign, commas for use 
in large numbers, user control of the number of significant digits in a 
number, the use of parentheses for negative numbers, and debit and 



credit symbols (DB and CR). Furthermore, you can display or print for- 
mulas at the individual cell locations or for the entire worksheet. Some 
additional math functions, including modulo, round, and weighted aver- 
age calculations, have also been provided. 

If you've already developed some VisiCalc III worksheets, they can 
easily be run with the new Advanced Version. This is a fine example of a 
good product made better. If you use VisiCalc often, you may find this 
new version worth considering. 

Software Profiles. Datapro Research Corporation, a McGraw-Hill 
company, produces several major publications that may be of interest to 
you. Although these are rather expensive documents, they have the po- 
tential to be quite helpful to certain business users. 

The first publication is Datapro's Directory of Microcomputer Soft- 
ware. This directory lists more than two thousand comprehensive (and 
objective) descriptions of microcomputer software packages for twenty- 
seven applications areas. These descriptions include user ratings and sup- 
plier profiles. The material is readable and thorough, and monthly up- 
dates are provided. To be sure, the directory doesn't focus solely on soft-

B.U.G.s Have More Fun. There isn't a lot of pizzazz in business ap- 
plications. Spreadsheets, word processors, accounting packages, and da- 
tabases just don't have the same charisma that Time Zone, Wizardry, 
Frogger, and Centipede do. Be that as it may, every now and then a prod- 
uct comes along that's both useful and fun. One such product is the 
Voice Box from the Alien Group. 

The Voice Box is aptly named: it allows your Apple to speak. The 
package includes a board to be plugged into slot 4 of your Apple, a bet- 
ter speaker than your Apple's built-in speaker, a disk with a dictionary, 
some demonstration programs on disk, and a guide to operation and in- 
stallation. Once the board has been installed and the speaker connected 
(easy tasks), your Apple can talk. Amazingly enough, it talks pretty well. 
Yes, it speaks in a bit of a monotone, but the words are clear and 
distinct. 

One option lets you type whatever you wish on the keyboard; when 
you press return, the Apple verbalizes what you typed. If the words 
you've used are in the Voice Box dictionary, they'll sound quite nice. If 
you've used a new word, it probably won't be spoken correctly. To reme- 
dy this, you simply type in the word as it would sound. For instance, the 
name "Tom" might have to be typed as "Tawm" in order to sound right. 
Once you've determined and entered the phonetic spelling of a word, you 
can store it in the dictionary and have it recognized in the future. 

A second option allows you to write a program that "sends" your 
print statements to slot 4 of the Apple. In effect, this means that what 
would have been printed will now be spoken. Some rather interesting ap- 
plications can be achieved by means of this option. In addition, the Voice

Box can display a face (it's not very attractive, though) that raises its eye- 
brows and moves its lips as it speaks. 

Lastly, the Voice Box can sing. Barry Manilow, don't panic. All in 
all, this is mainly a fun option. 

To build a device like the Voice Box ten years ago would probably 
have required the efforts of a Stanford University Ph.D. candidate 
and a grant of $200,000. Now you can have your own talking Apple for a 
good deal less. The Voice Box alone (you provide your own speaker) sells 
for around $140. The package, complete with a dictionary in ROM, sing- 
ing capability, and speaker, costs about $215. This is a fun product with a 
lot of potential, particularly as an addition to CAI programs, business 
training programs, typing tutorials, and programs for the physically 
disabled. 

B.U.G.s Helping Bugs. A short time ago, one of our readers asked 
for some help in getting Apple Writer to use all of the features of the Ep- 
son printer. This was, as it turned out, a problem many readers had come 
up against. Various readers who'd solved the problem wrote in to share 
what they'd discovered. Everyone who wrote indicated that finding a 
way to get the most out of the Apple Writer /Epson interface was a la- 
borious process, and no one had been able to get much help from other 
sources. 

It was indeed with some elation that B.U.G.s from all over wrote to 
share their "finds." Almost everyone's solutions were basically the same 
(and almost all respondents included a sample of what they could now 
do with their Epson, proof positive of their success in solving this baf- 
fling puzzle). 

One response, from Dan Cogan of Okemos, Michigan, was particu- 
larly clear and well written. He deals with interfacing Apple Writer and 
an MX-80 with Graftrax Plus, although if you have an MX-lOO, the 
principle is the same. Cogan writes: 

"I first created a glossary of print options to enable me to call any of 
them with two keystrokes — control-M plus the one-letter glossary defi- 
nition. This file, created with Apple Writer II, was then saved under the 
name Print Glossary. It was recalled by typing control-Q to enter the ad- 
ditional-functions menu, followed by the number 5 to load a glossary 
file. A prompt requests the file name, and I enter Print Glossary. 

"As an example, to enter the definition for double width, enter the 
following 

Step Keystroke 

1 d 

2 control-V 

3 control-N 

4 control-V 

5 return 

"1. The small letter d defines the glossary item. 

"2. The control-V tdh Apple Writer that the characters following are 
not commands to the word processor but are instead to be accepted as 
text. As page 51 of the Apple Writer manual explains with regard to this 
mode, 'You may enter control characters as text file entries for purposes 
such as controlling special printer features.' 

"3. Control-N, according to page C-1 of my Epson manual, turns 
on the double-width mode for the current line. Apple Writer doesn't have 
the ability to count spaces correctly when using double-width or com- 
pressed characters, so they're best used on a single line followed by a 
return. 

"4. The control-V turns off text file entry of control characters so 
that control characters will once again be treated as commands to the 
word processor. 

"A somewhat different problem is presented by print options, such as 
italics, that can't be represented by control characters. In this case, sub- 
stitute escape-4 for control-N in step 3. 

"Follow step 3 with control-V and return, as in the first example. This 
permits entry of the codes required for many options (according to the 
table on page B-1 of the Epson manual). 

"To turn off the italics, substitute the number 5 for the number 4. 
Underscoring is a little different. After hitting the escape key, enter a —1. 
To stop underscoring, type shift-control-P (that is, hold down both the 
shift and control keys while typing the letter P) after the escape and

minus keys have been pressed. According to the table on page C-1 of the 
Epson manual, this is the null character, and it seems to provide the zero 
that's required to stop underscoring. 

"I enter my table of definitions using Apple Writer II as described 
earlier, separating each definition by a return. Remember that the first 
letter is the definition and that upper and lower case letters are separate 
definitions. Thus, I define double-width mode with a small d and define 
turning off double-width mode with a capital D. Similarly, I define 
underscoring with a lower-case u and turn off underscoring with a capi- 
tal U. Once I've entered all the definitions, they are saved as just de- 
scribed and then recalled using the additional functions menu, option 
number 5. At this point, simply typing control-G followed by the single 
letter definition will allow a wide variety of print options with Apple 
Writer II, using only two keystrokes." 

Cogan goes on to say that the task of writing his letter made him 
appreciate how difficult it must be to write good documentation. We 
would say that his presentation was quite well done and should be of 
great help to many a reader. Many thanks. 

More Help from B.U.G.s. Jerry Brieger of Redmond, Washington, 
lets readers in on a "completely undocumented, but very useful" fact. He 
writes to say that "a simple control-O [not zero] will initialize the Epson 
for compressed print. This is especially useful when you're printing 
spreadsheets. Just turn the printer on, then the Apple, push reset, then 
pr#l, control-O, and you have compressed print until you turn the 
printer off. If you have Graftrax or the new Model III, hitting escape-4 
turns italics on while using Apple Writer II and escape-5 turns italics off. 
Be sure to use upper-case letters!" 

From Gary Mott of Mason City, Iowa, comes news that the solu- 
tion to the Epson /Apple Writer problem lies in the fact that you must be 
in upper-case. "Control-K is used in the sequence of commands only if 
the upper-case-shift lock has not already been activated. My system 
doesn't have shift-key modification. I have used the commands on a sys- 
tem with the modification. The only difference is the escape escape se- 
quence. With the shift-key modification, the escape key need only be 
pressed once. An example: 



Emphasized mode on: control-K, control-V, escape, escape-E, 
control-V. 

Eric Oshlo of Katy, Texas, suggests that readers wanting to use all 
the features of their printers find out more about a program called the 
Universal Text Formater by Ziggurat Software in Arlington Heights, 
Illinois. Oshlo has Apple Writer 1.1 and a NEC 8023-A-C printer. The 
Universal Text Formater generates a replacement printer routine for the 
one that comes with Apple Writer. Since you can load in your specific 
printer control codes prior to installing it on the Apple Writer disk, the 
Text Formater works with virtually any printer. 

In summary, most of the people who had solutions to the 
Epson/ Apple Writer printer problem mentioned two important things. 
First, after entering control-V mode, you must press the escape key twice 
in order to get it into the text. Second, any letters that follow must be 
entered in upper-case. 

Epson Books. Lots of readers wrote or called to ask for the title of 
"that great Epson book." It's called the Epson MX Printer Manual, 
published by CompuSoft F*ublishing. It comes as part of the Graftrax 
update package when you purchase that option for your Epson. Unfor- 
tunately, however, it's not available separately. 

Another book you may find helpful is Minuteware's Minute Manual 
for Apple Writer II. This book contains step-by-step instructions for the 
program's six basic operating procedures, as well as information per- 
taining to the other operating procedures, such as print preview and 
pause while printing (which aren't given in the Apple Writer II manual). 
The book also contains complete Epson printing instructions to be used 
by those who have Graftrax and those who don't. It also contains a be- 
ginner's guide to word processing and a guide to the hardware and soft- 
ware enhancements available, such as eighty-column boards, lower- 
case adapters, shift-key modifications, Graftrax, and spell-checking 
programs. 

Print Preview. One of our readers complained that Apple Writer has 
no print preview option. Jim Pirisino from Columbia, Maryland, sug- 
gests that you can print either a forty-column or an eighty-column dis- 
play by means of the following procedure:

It's a Plot. Ronald Sladky of Perrysburg, Ohio, provides some an- 
swers for a B.U.G. member who wondered whether a color plotter was 
better than a color printer. Sladky has a Hewlett-Packard eight-pen plot- 
ter and an IDS Prism printer. According to Sladky, the plotter is far 
superior when it comes to graphics and can vary text size more than the 
printer can. The plotter is much slower, however, and must have its 
sheets fed to it one at a time. 

Daisy, Daisy, Give Me Your Answer. A Diablo owner in Lake- 
wood, Colorado, has responded to another reader's request for informa- 
tion about how well daisy wheel printers do graphics. Paul Goble has 
been using his Diablo 620 for about four months. It's a low-cost daisy 
wheel printer that uses new ninety-eight-character encoded print wheels. 
Both the ribbon and the print wheel are easily changed. Bidirectional 
printing at twenty characters per second and proportional spacing are 
fxjssible. 

Goble uses a software package (Sensible Software's Image Printer) to 
dump hi-res screens to the printer. Graphics are printed one dot at a 
time. Even with bidirectional printing, the process takes a long, long 
time. The samples Goble included in this letter were quite nice. He said. 



however, that one picture (a simple half-page, but dark, picture) took 
seventeen minutes to print. 

The image quality of the Diablo 620 is much better than that avail- 
able from most dot-matrix printers, and lots of special effects can be 
achieved by using special characters. The paper movement of the ma- 
chine is extraordinarily precise and results in very accurate graphics. If 
you're not going to need the capacity to print graphics very often but 
will need a high-quality printer, Goble definitely recommends a daisy 
wheel. 

More B.U.G. Requests. Here are a couple of additional requests 
from readers. See if you can help them out. Who knows — they may help 
you out one day. 

One reader, a builder/real estate developer, writes, "I'd like a simple 
word processing program to use for contracts, leases, rental agreements, 
form letters, and mailing lists. I also plan to add CP/M and an eighty- 
column board to my Apple. Any suggestions?" 

A B.U.G. teacher is using his Epson to prepare dittos and stencils for 
distribution as class materials. He finds that the only way to get a good 
ditto impression is to use double strike and emphasized mode. Does any- 
one else use an Epson in this way? Are there better techniques? 

Time Out. Well, we've only covered about half of what we were hop- 
ing to this month; we'll just have to lobby for more space in upcoming is- 
sues. Take care of yourselves. Keep writing; keep suggesting. Next 
month; WordStar and printer solutions, product reviews, and some sur- 
prises. See you then.

Diagnostic Disk Controller and System Assurance Package for Apple II 

Avoid SYSTEM-CRASH DATA LOSS^ 

Eliminate wasted time and effort, BEFORE data entry, with automatic detection of component defects. 



APPLEsurance II is a combination 
diagnostic and system assurance tool 
plus a fully compatible disk controller 
card for your Apple II. Each time you 
power-on, sophisticated diagnostic 
routines in ROM mounted on the disk 
controller card automatically check 
your basic system hardware. If there is 
a problem, descriptive messages on 
the monitor will indicate the location of 
the problem and, in some cases, indi- 
cate the specific component involved. 

These automatic checks include 
MOTHERBOARD RAM, LANGUAGE 
CARD RAM, PROCESSOR TEST, 
ADDRESS TEST, MOTHERBOARD 
ROM, ROM CARD ROM, and RE- 
FRESH TEST. If there is no problem, 
you have the assurance that your 
system is working well and you can 
proceed confidently with your data 
entry. 

Automatic diagnostics take just a few 
seconds and happen ONLY at power- 
up. Thereafter, APPLEsurance II in no 
way interferes with the normal opera- 
tion of the disk drive controller function 
of the card. Bypass of these routines 

is optional. 



The second part of the APPLEsurance 
II system are disk based diagnostic 
and assurance tests for further and 
more extensive subsystem checks.

The Simplicity of 
Modularity 

BY ALLEH mmo 



"Those who do not learn from the past are condemned to repeat it." 

— George Santayana 

The Apple II is an extremely versatile machine, exhibiting different 
personalities under different operating systems and programmable in a 
number of languages. These languages include Basic (the native lan- 
guage of the Apple II), Pascal, Fortran, Cobol, Pilot, Logo, Forth, Tiny 
C, Lisp, microSpeed, PL/1, and 6502 assembly language, as weD as as- 
semblers for a variety of coprocessor boards. One of the most recent ad- 
ditions to the Apple II family of languages is Modula-2, a compact yet 
powerful structured programming language. 

Simplicity versus Complexity. A never-ending debate in the design 
of computer programming languages centers on the issue of complexity. 
Language designers must weigh the virtues of simplicity, which pro- 
motes rapid learning and program readability, against the advantages 
gained when complexity is introduced in the form of many convenient 
programming features. 

Basic is an example of a language that, at least in its original concep- 
tion, was designed to be quite simple. That Basic failed to remain simple 
as machine-specific dialects evolved was the consequence of its failure to 



provide many essential features, such as disk I/O. 

PL/1, on the other hand, is an example of a language designed to 
provide many features, at the price of increased complexity. One conse- 
quence of PL/l's complexity is that it's difficult to fit a compiler for the 
language into a personal computer. (An Apple II PL/1 subset compiler 
exists, but it requires 64K RAM, a Z-80 card, and two eight-inch floppy 
disk drives — not an inexpensive personal computer configuration.) 

Pascal is an example of a powerful, modem computer language that 
is nonetheless simple. Niklaus Wirth designed Pascal to be a straightfor- 
ward teaching language, and its simplicity has contributed to its wide ac- 
ceptance in colleges and universities. The advantage of simplicity in Pas- 
cal is not, however, just that it can be learned fairly easily. Pascal's sim- 
ple, structured design promotes a programming style that underscores 
the logical structure of a program's design. Simplicity of the language 
also promotes the wrifing of programs that are easy to read and modify. 

The goals of structured languages like Pascal are, first, to help pro- 
grammers write correct code, and, second, to encourage the writing of 
maintainable programs. Maintainable programs can be modified by peo- 
ple other than the programmers who originally wrote them. Maintaina- 
bility is a very important goal for major programming projects. Studies 



210 



TTTT 



MARCH 1983 



have shown that software maintenance may account for 70 to 90 percent 
of the total software costs for such projects; controlling this expenditure 
has become a matter of vital concern to software industry managers. 

Programmers have their own reasons for caring about the issue of 
software maintenance. It's a lot more enjoyable to design and write new 
programs than it is to spend 70 to 90 percent of one's time trying to fig- 
ure out how to modify someone else's code. Pascal-related languages are 
therefore of interest to anyone who writes substantial programs ex- 
pected to remain in use for some time. 

The question is, which language is best? 

A Committee of One. Wirth developed Pascal in response to the de- 
sign of another programming language, Algol-68, which was aeated over 
a period of several years by an international committee of computer sci- 
entists. Perhaps because the language was committee-designed, it be- 
came unwieldy, as almost all the features desired by the experts were add- 
ed to the language. Rejecting the notion of a language built to the specifi- 
cations of a committee, Wirth produced in 1968 the much simpler and 
more elegant programming language, Pascal. 

The verdict of history, in this instance, supports the efforts of the in- 
dividual language designer over those of the committee. Today Pascal is 
the computer language employed most widely for teaching program- 
ming in American universities. In addition, it has enjoyed widespread 
success on personal computers, with many thousands of personal com- 
puter users employing UCSD Pascal, and with tens of thousands of Ap- 
ple II owners making use of Apple Pascal (which is based on UCSD Pas- 
cal). By contrast, there is no demand for Algol-68 compilers for personal 
computers. 

Enter Ada. Managers and programmers committed to the discipline 
of structured programming are now wondering whether history is about 
to repeat itself. Ada, a large, complex, feature-laden programming lan- 
guage, was painstakingly designed under United States Department of 
Defense contracts in the late 1970s. As of this writing, there is no fully 
validated Ada compiler available on any computer, although for some 
time several have been in development for large superminicomputers and 
IBM mainframes. Implementability was one of the design requirements 



of Ada, but the compiler generation process is calling into question how 
well this requirement was actually met. 

Ada is not the first computer language to be developed under the 
sponsorship of the Department of Defense. Cobol, one of the lan- 
guages abhorrent to structured programmers, was also the product of a 
committee sponsored by the defense department. 

The Ada language emerged after many years of DOD-sponsored lan- 
guage design and development. Ada is named for Lady Augusta Ada 
Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron and the world's first computer pro- 
grammer. She wrote programs for Charles Babbage's analytical engine, a 
mechanical computer that was never completed because the machine- 
building technology of the day could not provide the fine tolerances 
called for in its design. Despite years of grant support from the British 
government, the analytical engine failed; Ada's critics see a parallel in the 
future of the language named for its programmer. 

Hundreds of computer scientists and sophisticated computer users 
contributed to Ada's many design phases. As a result, the language pro- 
vides numerous features, including some that work against the principle 
of simplicity. The parallels between Ada and Algol-68 are striking. Is 
there a candidate for the role of a simple competitor to Ada? Can any 
programming language become an alternative to Ada, as Pascal was to 
Algol-68? 

The answer, of course, is yes. 

All This and Modula-2. Wirth, apparently unhappy once again with 
the product of a language-design committee, has produced a new lan- 
guage, Modula-2. Wirth based the design of Modula-2 on two lan- 
guages he had developed earlier, Pascal and Modula. Modula was an ex- 
perimental language for multiprogramming — which is writing programs 
that do several different things, such as read from the keyboard and from 
a joystick "simultaneously." (In computers that can actually do only one 
thing at a given instant, such as an Apple II that hasn't been modified 
through the addition of a coprocessor, the simultaneousness is only ap- 
parent. Modula permitted the programmer, as well as the user, to treat 
the different active processes as if they were simultaneous.) Modula did 
not, however, have the fiall range of programming language features that

Pascal has. Modula-2 incorporates these Pascal-like features with a syn- 
tax more like Modula's; hence the name, Modula-2. 

Small Can Be Beautiful. Modula-2 was designed by a single com- 
puter scientist driven by a consistent vision that placed a high value on 
simplicity in the language. As a result, the core of Modula-2 is quite 
small; Wirth defined it in a book of only 48 pages. In contrast, the Pas- 
cal book has 167 pages (Jensen and Wirth's Pascal User Manual and Re- 
port) and the Ada document tops out at 236 {Reference Manual for the 
Ada Programming Language, Proposed Standard Document). The econ- 
omy in Modula-2's syntax was achieved, in part, by not including every 
desirable feature in the language itself Instead, utility features can be 
added in modules, program blocks similar in function to Apple Pascal 
units. 

Ada, meanwhile, offers a wide range of features, many of which are 
quite sophisticated but may be employed only rarely. Charles Moore, the 
inventor of Forth, says that Ada has "tried to be all things to all people. 
It's much too complex a language — especially for the less experienced 
programmer.'" 

Ada and Modula-2 have a number of similarities. Both took Pascal 
as a starting point for development (although Ada deviates from that 
standard more than does Modula-2). The experienced Pascal program- 
mer will find it fairly easy to follow most of the source text of programs 
written in either language. 

Both Ada and Modula-2 seek to remedy a number of the same de- 
sign flaws in Pascal. Enhancements provide for concurrent processing 
and more direct programmer access to the machine. An important set of 
changes enforces a more modular approach to programming than does 
standard Pascal. 

Working Together, Separately. Modular programming encourages 
the independent development and testing of conceptually separate por- 
tions of a program. This modularity permits the assignment of different 
functions of a major programming project to different programmers, 
who, once the software interfaces among the separate parts have been 
specified, can develop programs independently. 

Modular programming is an important prerequisite for the emer- 
gence of a software-engineering discipline. From a software-engineering 
viewpoint, programs are not usually the result of the artistic vision of a 
programming virtuoso working in isolation from other programmers. 
Instead, programs are built up out of a set of software components pro- 
duced by software engineers who may even be anonymous to each other. 

On large software projects, the software-engineering approach is par- 
ticularly important. Different programming teams may be assigned dif- 
ferent portions of the programming task. For example, one team may 
develop a set of user input routines, another may work on saeen and 
printer output portions of the program, while still another might work 
on database manipulation procedures. The project manager sees to it 
that the separate portions of a program interact with each other only by 
means of software interfaces with an agreed-upon structure. One team 
cannot change this structure (in order to optimize a data representation 
for input or output, for example) without prior approval from the proj- 
ect manager. Each time a change of this sort is approved, all the teams 
working on the project must take it into account. Working this way can 
be time-consuming and expensive. For this reason the software inter- 
faces get plenty of attention during the planning stage of a programming 
project. 

Both Ada and Modula-2 are intended to enforce modularity in order to 
encourage a software-engineering approach to software development. 
Even UCSD Pascal and Apple Pascal provide some features in support 
of modular programming that are not part of Wirth's original definition 
of Pascal. The most important of these is the unit, which provides for the 
separate compilation of program portions that can later be used by main 
programs. 

In the Apple Pascal approach to units, the interface portion of the 
unit specifies which parts of the unit are public — that is, which parts can 
be used by other programs. The implementation portion of a unit con- 
tains the actual code for that unit, including both the public and the "pri- 
vate" (or invisible) procedures and functions. The Apple Pascal turtle 
graphics unit, for example, contains public procedures such as 
PENCOLOR and MOVETO that can be used by other programs to

draw on the hi-res saeen. Other procedures in turtle graphics are used by 
the public procedures but aren't available to outside programs. These are 
the private portions of the unit. 

Special Security. Modula-2 goes several steps beyond UCSD Pas- 
cal units in ensuring that separate program portions maintain their in- 
tegrity throughout the program development process. Hugh Mack- 
worth, a product manager in the Apple III Product Group at Apple 
Computer, points out that Modula-2's modules are superior to Pascal's 
units in that they are more secure. Modules have two parts, a definition 
and an implementation, which are compiled separately. The definition 
part of a module resembles the interface concept in UCSD Pascal and 
Apple Pascal. Like a unit, a module can be used by other modules and 
programs that are its clients. All communication between the implemen- 
tation part of a module and its client is set forth in the module definition. 

The extra level of security provided by the preset communication is 
that a programmer cannot accidentally (or maliciously, for that matter) 
alter the definition portion of a module and foist it off on an unsuspect- 
ing client module that must use it. It could be disastrous if the value of 
PENCOLOR were changed to be an integer (from 0 to 7, say) instead of 
a type COLOR (WHITEl, BLACK 1, or whatever). A client module 
that expects to be able to say 

IF PENCOLOR = WHITE1 . . . 
instead of 

IF PENCOLOR = 0 . . . 

will clearly not perform correctly if the module it uses is changed arbi- 
trarily. The Modula-2 system requires that the client module be recom- 
piled if the definition of the module it uses has been changed. 

A Wirthwhile Definition. Wirth's publication of the Modula-2 defi- 
nition has met with approval in software engineering circles. Tom De- 
Marco, a structured systems development expert with Yourdon, a large 
software consulting house, argues, "If you go back and compare Mod- 
ula-2 to the statement of objectives published for Ada, you're likely to 
conclude, as I do, that Modula-2 satisfies most of them as well as Ada, 
but with far less obfuscation."^ 

Modula-2, when first announced, was not available commercially on 
any computer. The original implementations in Wirth's lab in Switzer- 
land were done on PDP-11 minicomputers and an experimental super- 
micro called Lilith. Further experimental implementations have been 
performed at the University of Utah's computer science department. Un- 
til now, however, those interested in Modula-2 have had no convenient 
way of getting hands-on experience with the language. 



Volition Systems, a software house based in Del Mar, California, has 
solved this problem by releasing an implementation of Modula-2 for the 
Apple II computer. Volition Systems hopes to implement Modula-2 for 
computer manufacturers and large software houses interested in doing 
systems and applications programming in this advanced language. 

Volition views its Apple II implementation as a working advertise- 
ment for the Modula-2 language, one that will attract assignments to de- 
velop Modula-2 systems for other computers, such as the Lisa and other 
advanced 68000 systems now appearing in the personal computer mar- 
ket. Apple II owners don't have to wait, however: the complete system is 
already available to them. 

Used in conjunction with the Apple Pascal 1.1 operating system, 
Modula-2 is a complete software development system. The Volition Sys- 
tems Modula-2 compiler offers the standard Modula-2 language, with 
two differences. These are forward declarations, which permit a proce- 
dure to be referenced before it is defined in a source file, and packed data 
representations, for more economical use of storage space. Both of these 
features are familiar to Apple Pascal users. 

Using the Library. Additional features, including many based on the 
UCSD Pascal operating system, are available not as language extensions 
but rather as modules. A total of twenty-two utility modules to support 
program execution are provided in a module library. 

As in Apple Pascal, the library is a separate file, usually kept on the 
boot disk, that contains frequently used program portions. This file is 
usually called M0DULA2. LIBRARY, but other libraries can be created 
by the programmer and can be called from whatever disk they reside on. 
A module such as turtle graphics is kept in the library. From there it can 
be used by any program that wants to take advantage of the software it 
provides for manipulating the hi-res screen. 

The Modula-2 language is actually smaller than Apple Pascal. Many 
essential capabilities are not included in the language directly; instead, 
they're provided in the utility modules found in the library. These li- 
brary modules provide for sequential file handling, random-access file 
routines, standard read and write routines, storage allocation (Apple 
Pascal programmers will be happy to get working NEW and DISPOSE 
procedures), a math library, console handling, subprogram calling, and a 
process scheduler for concurrent processes such as the standard utility 
modules called for by Wirth's specification of Modula-2. In addition, 
Volition Systems provides modules that give the programmer access to 
UCSD features such as string functions and procedures, UCSD file han- 
dling routines, CRT I/O procedures, and some bit-handling facilities. 

A recent Modula-2 release offers programmers the capability of call-

ing Pascal programs from Modula-2, and gives them access to the turtle 
graphics and Applestuff library units. The new release also offers facil- 
ities for interrupt-driven processes, permitting real-time control in 
Modula-2. 

The major advantage of Modula-2 over Apple Pascal is that Mod- 
ula-2 enforces a structured development discipline. During the devel- 
opment of a major software product, programmers working on different 
interacting modules need only agree on their interfaces, not on the inter- 
nal structure of the modules. Once a module definition is established and 
compiled, changes in the internal structure of the implementation 
part of the module or in the internal structure of the client — the module 
that uses the "slave" module — won't cause the client and the module to 
interfere with each other. On the other hand, whenever the definition 
portion of a module is changed and recompiled, Modula-2 requires the 
recompilation of those clients that use the module, as well as the recom- 
pilation of the module's implementation. This interface policing ensures 
proper communication among modules. 

At the time of compilation, every module is given a "module key." 
This key is a number generated by looking at the system clock. The sys- 
tem checks for a module key mismatch between an interface and an im- 
plementation or client at run time. If a mismatch is found, a program 
won't run until all necessary parts have been recompiled. This enforce- 
ment policy permits the improved software development methods char- 
acteristic of structured programming by preventing users from abusing 
the modular approach. 

Computer-Age Mad Hatters. At some point in the development of 
any new computer programming language, someone has to decide just 
which features are part of the language and which are not. International 
standards committees are formed to determine whether extensions to an 
existing language are necessary, and, if so, what form they should take. 
This is necessary because different computer manufacturers can, and us- 
ually do, release different versions of the same language. Rather like the 
Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland, who claimed that words meant 
whatever he wanted them to mean, the computer manufacturers and 
compiler developers seem to say that Basic or Fortran or Pascal are de- 
fined by their versions of these languages. The differences that result can 



make programs written in the same language on two different machines 
incompatible. This means that a lot of expensive reprogramming must be 
done when a program is transferred from one machine to another, even 
though the same language is being used on both. 

Because the Modula-2 language core is small, the task of defining a 
standard is straightforward. The techniques used for I/O, process sched- 
uling, and storage allocation for a particular Modula-2 implementation 
are not part of the language, but are rather provided in standard mod- 
ules. This means that users can replace the utilities provided with others 
of their own invention. Furthermore, these features, because they are 
provided by modules, need be present in a system's memory only when 
they're required by an applications program, thus conserving system re- 
sources. 

Comparatively Speaking — Benefits and Burdens. Modula-2 per- 
mits low-level machine access by providing pointer arithmetic and fixed- 
address variables, thus obviating the need for the tricky variant records 
required to get at machine addresses in Pascal. Furthermore, Modula-2 
provides for explicit type conversion, thereby giving the programmer bet- 
ter access to the machine than Pascal does, while making the intent clear- 
er than most Pascal methods for type conversion do. 

Dynamic array parameters are possible in Modula-2. Pascal pro- 
grammers will rejoice at not having to set array bounds for formal pa- 
rameters at the time that a subprogram is written. 

Procedure variables are available in Modula-2. This is a more gen- 
eral form of the proposed procedure parameter enhancement to ISO 
Pascal, the version of Pascal authorized by an international standards 
group. 

Fewer BEGIN-END pairs are required in Modula-2 than in Pascal, 
because the WHILE, WITH, FOR, and IF constructs are all terminated 
with END. 

Translation Process. Like Apple Pascal programs, Modula-2 pro- 
grams must be compiled to p-code before they can be run. P-code is in- 
terpreted to a microprocessor's instructions at run time by a portion of 
the operating system called the p-code interpreter. The result is transport- 
ability; a program compiled to p-code can be executed on any system 
that has a p-code interpreter. Programs in compiled languages also run

faster than those written in interpreted languages like Basic. 

There are other minor but welcome improvements to Pascal in Mod- 
ula-2. Constant expressions are permitted, so that the programmer can 
make constant declarations like 

CONST HALFMAX = MAX DIV2. 

Declaration order restrictions are relaxed, which makes it possible to 
group constant, type, variable, and procedure declarations in a natural 
way. Flow of control is improved through the inclusion of features such 
as LOOP-EXIT. The CASE statement has been improved — first, by per- 
mitting subranges as well as constants as case selectors and, second, by 
providing an explicit ELSE condition as an option. 

Logical expressions are evaluated from left to right and the evaluation 
is short-circuited. This means that if a complex expression like 

IF (A AND (B AND (C AND D))) 
is being evaluated and A turns out to be false, the evaluation will stop 
and return the value false for the whole expression, since the expression 
as a whole cannot be true, no matter what the truth values of B, C, and 
D are. 

In Pascal, the entire expression is evaluated. This "full evaluation" 
feature of Pascal is annoying; it means that the programmer must al- 
ways insert extra if clauses to ensure that there will be no attempt to eval- 
uate expressions that use array indices that exceed array bounds. With 
short-circuited evaluation, the programmer can simply put an array 
bounds check ahead of the reference to the array in a sequence of 
ANDed Boolean expressions. 

Modula-2's many benefits are partially offset by some disadvan- 
tages. The simplicity of Modula-2 syntax imposes some extra burdens on 
the programmer. One example of this is the lack of generic I/O proce- 
dures. In Pascal, the program can use the single procedure WRITE to 
output integers, real numbers, characters, and (in UCSD Pascal) strings. 
In Modula-2, variables of each type must be output with a procedure 
that takes parameters of that type. This means more lines of source code 
for the programmer to write, but the compiled code is no less compact or 
efficient than that produced by a Pascal compiler. The difference is that 
the Modula-2 programmer must do some of the work that is handled by 
the compiler in Pascal. 

Many programmers may find Modula-2's case sensitivity an annoy- 
ance. Upper and lower case are significant in Modula-2; the variable 
My Var has a different referent from the variable MYVAR, and both are 
different from Myvar. It's easy to forget what you've capitalized. For- 
tunately for users of unmodified Apple II Pluses, the Volition Systems 
implementation provides a compiler option to turn off case sensitivity. 

Side by Side. Listings 1 and 2 compare simple Apple Pascal and 
Modula-2 programs, the purpose of which is to display available mem- 
ory. Each of these programs displays the memory available with only the 
operating system and language support features loaded, along with the 
simple program. 

In the Pascal program, a long integer variable, Wordsavail, is de- 
clared in order to avoid an integer overflow if available memory was 
greater than 32K. In the Modula program this is unnecessary, since 
MemAvail returns a cardinal value (up to 64K). Note that extra output 
statements are required in the Modula-2 version of the program in order 
to write out strings, carriage returns, and cardinal numbers. 

Modula-2 is an advanced programming language. Its enforcement of 
structured program development makes it an appropriate vehicle for at- 
tacking major software projects. The process scheduling and direct ma-

More detailed information on programming in Modula-2 is 
available in a new book by Wirth, Programming in Modula-2.' Ap- 
ple owners who believe in hands-on learning can try out the Voli- 
tion Systems implementation of Modula-2. The Apple system 
must include either an Apple He or another Apple II with the Ap- 
ple language system (a 1 6K RAM card plus the Apple Pascal op- 
erating system disks) and two floppy disk drives. An eighty-col- 
umn display is also recommended, but it's no more necessary than 
in Apple Pascal. 

The Apple lie uses the Modula-2 system without modifica- 
tions to either the software or the hardware. As with the Apple II, 
two disk drives and Apple Pascal software are required. The up- 
per and lower case keyboard with its full ASCII character set is a 
great advantage for editing. The new Apple eighty-column card is 
automatically recognized and used by the operating system. 

What about the eighty-column card with the second 64K 
memory bank? The present Modula-2 release cannot make use of 
this extra memory, but Volition Systems expects to be able to sup- 
port the entire 128K in a future version. Work is already under 
way to supply 128K versions of Modula-2 for other 128K com- 
puters. In the planned implementation, the new 64K bank of 
memory will probably be devoted to data — the stack and heap in 
the Pascal system — freeing up the original 64K for operating sys- 
tem and code alone.

END Mod2Example. 

(* 30200 bytes are available with system swapping on *) 

Listing 2. The corresponding Modula-2 program. 

chine access features suit it to systems work. It also offers a number of 
small but significant syntax improvements over standard and UCSD 
Pascal. Because the language is small and closely related to Pascal, it can 
be learned quickly by Pascal programmers. This combination of advan- 
tages in Modula-2 has been accomplished at the cost of some inconveni- 
ence to the programmer when input/ output programming is called for. 
On the other hand, it is a tribute to the compactness of this program- 
ming language that it can be used on a 64K personal computer. 

When More Is Less and Less Is More. Modula-2 has been referred 
to as the language that Ada was meant to be. Like Ada, it remedies some 
of the problems of Pascal, making it an even more appropriate language 
for medium and large-scale programming projects. Unlike Ada, it is a 
compact language and can be learned in a fairly short time. 

Those who believe that programming languages should include every 
potentially useful feature expect that Ada will prove to be a more val- 
uable contribution to the discipline of programming than Modula-2. Sup- 
porters of simplicity in programming language design claim that Mod- 
ula-2 is clearly superior to Ada, not only in learnability and implementa- 
bility, but also in how well it encourages the writing of correct programs. 

Modula-2 is available now for the Apple II. On the other hand, there 
will almost certainly never be a complete implementation of Ada for any 
64K machine; it is not clear that a 256K machine is large enough. Still, 



larger machines will become more common in the 1980s, and we can ex- 
pect full Adas eventually. History, as written by the computer program- 
ming community, will decide between these two competing successors to 
Pascal. 31

The obvious reason to invest your hard-earned money in the mar- 
kets is to make money. The more money you make, the better. But 
there's an immutable natural law that keeps the enthusiasm of even the 
most stalwart investor within bounds: to make money, you have to risk 
money. The more capital you put at risk, the more money you stand to 
make, or lose. 

Securities and Investment Instruments. The most common form of 
investing is buying a security. You buy a security when you pay dollar 
for dollar the present market value of that security. You, or your brok- 
er, take physical possession of the instrument, and you own it. Theoret- 
ically, you stand to make an infinite amount of profit on your invest- 
ment; the higher the trading price of the asset goes, the more money you 
make. At the same time, your potential loss is limited. You cannot lose 
more money than you originally paid for the security. 

However, if you leverage your investment (that is, pay only a part of 
the purchase price out of your own pocket and borrow the rest), your 
loss may end up being much greater than your original out-of-pocket ex- 
pense. Say, for instance, that you buy 100 shares of TTM Industries at a 
price of $10 per share. If you purchase the lot (100 shares), your maxi- 
mum downside exposure is 100 x $10, or $1 ,000. But if you leverage your 
investment (which is also known as buying on margin), you can use the 
same $1,000 to control many more than 100 shares. For example, pay- 
ing 10 percent of the purchase price with your own money and owing the 
balance ($1,000/$ 10 x .1) would allow you to control ten times as many 
shares. 

If the price of TTM increased, you'd be in fat city. Your profit would 
be ten times as great as it would have been if you hadn't leveraged your 
investment. But if TTM decreased in value, you'd be in real trouble! As 
the price of the security went lower, you'd have to pay off more and 
more of the balance. And remember, the balance you owed would be for 
1,000 shares, not 100. 

This payment (the money you give the broker as the price of the 
stock declines) is known as a margin call. From the point of view of the 
seller, it can almost be considered insurance. If you don't have the money 
to pay the seller when the price of the security starts to fall, then the sell- 
er stands to lose money also. So if you don't ante up, you lose your origi- 
nal investment as well as any additional funds you've invested. 

Options afford you an alternative investment strategy. They allow 
you to control the same 1,000 shares for only a fraction of their market 
price. If, say, you thought that TTM was going to increase in value, 
you'd buy a call option. A call gives you the right to purchase a specific 
number of TTM shares at a negotiated price for the period of the option 
contract. For this right, you pay the sellee, or the writer of the option, a 
fee known as a premium. 

Let's assume that the writer is asking a $2-per-share premium. To ob- 
tain a call option for 100 shares, you'd pay the writer $200 ($2 x 100 
shares). This would give you the option, the right, to buy 100 TTM shares 
at the preset price, known as the striking price. In this example the strik- 
ing price is the current price, $10. 

This $200 investment gives you the right to buy 100 shares of TTM 



(market value $1,000). How might you make money in this situation? If 
the price of the stock increased to $14 per share, you'd buy the 100 shares 
for $1,000 and then immediately resell them for $14 apiece. Your gross 
profit on this transaction would be $400 ($ 1 ,400 - $ 1 ,000). Subtract your 
premium cost of $200 and you'd have a net profit, before commission 
costs, of $200. 

The Put and the Pendulum. There are also options known as puts. A 
put allows you to sell a security at a given price. If you believed a secur- 
ity was going to decrease in value, you'd buy a put. 

If TTM were at $10 per share and you thought it might go down to 
$6, you'd buy a put at a $10 striking price per share. Then, if the price of 
TTM really did go down to $6, you'd buy TTM at the market price and 
exercise your option, selling it at a price of $10 per share. If you paid the 
same $200 premium ($2 per share on 100 shares), your net profit before

Lee McFadden makes 
learning to use your 
computer and its programs 
an easy, rewarding 
experience. 

Mastering a new system or even a new 
program is not easy. It takes a lot of study, a 
lot of trial and en-or, a lot of back-and-forth 
between dense manuals and your computer. 
Wouldn't it all be so much easier if you had 
a knowledgeable friend sitting by your side? 

Lee McFadden is that friend. He's been 
producing widely acclaimed teaching tapes 
for over ten years. He knows what infonna- 
tion you need, and exactly when you need 
it. Team his skill with the know-how of 
technical experts, and you get a faster, 
easier way to master your computer and all 
its power. 

Patented Audio Cassettes 

Lee guides you patiently, step-by-step, while 
you're sitting at your keyboard. No con- 
nection between the computer and your 
cassette player is necessary. You learn by 
doing, instead of by reading. And even the 
tapes are special— a patented HipTrack 
system lets you go at your own pace, 



covering as much or as little detail as 
you want. 

Ideal for Training 

Use the courses over and over again. Share 
them with friends, family, students and staff. 
Make "computer literacy" a reality in your 
local schools. Bring a new employee "up to 
speed" in just hours, instead of weeks. The 
fully indexed Guide included with each 
course is, by itself, an invaluable, on-going 
reference.

commissions would again be $200. 

Although the foregoing is a simplified explanation of options, it con- 
veys an important point: you the investor can control a large dollar 
amount of securities while at the same time limiting your actual invest- 
ment, and thus your potential loss. 

Options investing requires a great deal more time and attention than 
your normal, run-of-the-mill blue chip investment. Market moves can be 
quick, complicated, and broad. Options analysis can be divided into two 
major components. The first is the analysis of the value of the option- 
able security. Is it sound? What are its prospects? The second is pricing. 
"How much should I pay to control this security," you ask yourself, 
"based on its underlying value and prospects?" 

Practitioners and academicians have tried for years to find the best 
way to price an option accurately. One of the most significant formulas 
to come out of these efforts is the Black -Scholes options pricing model. 
This model is the theoretical basis for the package we're going to look at 
now, the Stock Options Analysis Package (SOAP). 
Stock Options Analysis Program, H&H Scientific (13507 Pendel- 
ston Street, Fort Washington, MD 20744; 301-292-3100). $250. 

Backup policy: Within six months of purchase, no charge; after six 
months, $25. If the registration card is returned within ten days of pur- 
chase, an additional copy of the program disk may be purchased for $25. 

System requirements: DOS 3.3, Autostart ROM, 48K RAM, and 
Applesoft in ROM. 

Optional hardware: Printer; D.C. Hayes Micromodem II. 

SOAP uses the Black-Scholes options pricing module in determining 
the fair price of an option. The fair price is based on the price of the un- 
derlying optional security, the dividends paid, the security's volatility, cur- 
rent interest rates, and the remaining time (life) of the option. SOAP can 
calculate the expected profit or loss for any trade or spread (an options 
strategy) involving up to three classes of options on any one security. 

SOAP uses five different files to perform its analysis, each of which 
holds one or more of the variables used by the options pricing model. 



These files are volatility, daily, option download, dates, and commission 
schedules. 

The Volatility File. Stock price volatility is important data used in 
"options pricing" calculations. The more up-to-date your volatility in- 
formation is, the more accurate the output of your model will be. SOA P 
has a volatility file update program that is used for file maintenance. The 
program documentation recommends that you update the stock prices 
stored in the volatility file every month or so. 

The Black-Scholes model can also be used to calculate the market 
volatility. If the market-assigned option price is known, the model will 
calculate the market-assigned volatility. 

The authors estimate that it takes twenty minutes to update by hand 
a file that contains seventy-five entries, as opposed to five minutes to ac- 
complish the same task automatically by means of the Dow Jones re- 
trieval module within the program. Their estimates appear to be on tar- 
get. And if you have trouble finding your way around the financial sec- 
tion of your newspaper, the manual update process may take you a little 
longer. Updating using the modem whenever possible is a good idea; 
modem updates minimize the chance of human error. 

The volatility file also stores the dividend payment history, ex-divi- 
dend data, and the expiration cycle for each option. An investor should 
update the dividend information whenever a company under study an- 
nounces a dividend change. The suggested reference for this is Barron's; it 
carries both dividend information and ex-dividend dates. 

Daily. The Dow Jones auto price fetch module creates the daily file. 
The file contains the current prices for all of the securities you have stud- 
ied or for any subset you select. Each time SOA Pis run, it checks for the 
daily file. If the file exists, you're asked if you want to use the informa- 
tion contained in it. If you say yes, then any option carried in the SOAP 
program will use the daily file price as the current price. Make sure when 
you use it that the file does indeed contain the most recent prices. 

Option Download. This file carries the ticker symbols for the pro- 
grams fetched by the Dow Jones fetch module.

Dates. This file contains the number of business days within each 
month of the year and the number of business days remaining until the 
options you're studying expire. The time remaining on any option is a \ery 
important parameter and should be kept current. The authors recom- 
mend that you update this file every three months. 

Commission Schedules. Options to buy and sell will usually incur a 
broker's commission cost, just the way any other security will. SOAPa\- 
lows you to store the commission schedules of the brokers that you do 
business with. The program then analyzes the net profitability effect of 
the commission cost on the option being considered. If the commission 
schedules of any securities change, you can use SOAP to edit this file and 
make the adjustment. 

Using the Program. SOAP supplies three numbered commission 
schedules: the pre- 1976 standard NYSE commission schedule, a dis- 
count broker's schedule, and a full service broker's schedule. If you wish, 
you may add your own broker's commission schedule, which should be 
identified by its own number. Once you've selected the schedule you 
want, the program displays the name of the broker you've selected. If 
you've chosen the right schedule, just continue on; if not, you may spec- 
ify another commission identifier and the process will be repeated. 

Next SOAP searches for the daily file and, if it finds it, displays the 
date the file was last updated. If you tell SOAP that this is the file you 
want to use, the program automatically reads the price of any option 
you've specified in the volatility file. (Otherwise, the file is ignored.) It 
then requests the ticker symbol for the security you're going to analyze. 
The program then checks the volatility file, and if the security is there, 
50/1/' automatically gathers the data needed for the analysis. If the nec- 
essary information (including the security's current price) is not in the 
file, you're prompted to supply it. 

Next you're asked what volatility information should be used. You 
have three choices: supplying the information yourself, telling SOAP to 
compute the volatility, and instructing the program to get the data from 
the volatility file. A short discussion in the documentation describes what 
volatilities are most suitable for the types of analysis performed by 
SOAP. 

Fun, Fun, Fun, with T-Bills. The program also requires you to sup- 
ply a short-term interest rate. This may be input as either a decimal or a 
percentage. Most investors use the T-bill rate, which can be found in the 
Wall Street Journal, Barron's, or the business section of your local 
newspaper. 

SOAP then requests the current date and the number of business 
days remaining in the month. The Black -Scholes model uses this infor- 
mation in its calculations. Be very careful that the information you pro- 
vide here is correct; the accuracy of the model's predictions will be se- 
verely affected if incorrect information has been supplied. 

When it comes to investment strategy, SOAP offers you five 
choices — calendar spreads, vertical spreads, a straddle position, writing a 
covered call, and "other." 

The term calendar spread refers to buying a put or call and simul- 
taneously selling a put or call on the same security at the same striking 
price but on an earlier expiration date. If, when the first option expires, 
the security closes at or below the striking price for calls, or at or above 
the striking price for puts, you will not have to buy the security back. 
You can therefore recognize the premium received as profit. The re- 
maining option will still have some value. The investment's performance 
win decline if the security's price closes far from the striking price. If the 
security closes very high or very low relative to the striking price, the en- 
tire investment will be lost. 

A vertical spread consists of buying a call at one price and simul- 
taneously selling a call with the same expiration date at the next highest 
strike price. If this strategy is being followed, the put is sold at the next 
lowest strike price. Using calls, this spread generates a profit if the secur- 
ity closes at the upper strike price or higher. If puts are sold, the position 
is profitable if the security closes at or below the lower strike price. 

A straddle position entails buying a put and a call at the same strik- 
ing price simultaneously. This strategy is profitable if the price of the se- 
curity makes a large movement up or down, and unprofitable if the se- 
curity's price closes at or near the strike price. 

If you own a security you can write a covered call. For each 100

shares of the security owned, you may sell (write) one call contract. This 
strategy is most often used as a way of increasing the income stream 
from a security that has a stable price history or during periods of mar- 
ket stability. 

The "other" section is used to analyze any combination of up to 
three stock or security classes not covered by the previous investment 
strategy choices. You can also make use of this section in evaluating an 
existing position: the potential gain of the investment is measured against 
its present liquidation value. 

Volatile Expiration Cycles. SOAP now has all the data it needs to 
calculate the market assigned volatility of the security you're looking at. 
If the date of the next dividend is not included in the volatility file, you're 
asked to supply it. SOAP assumes that there's one dividend pay-out be- 
tween each expiration cycle. 

If historic volatility is being used, the program displays the stock 
name, the quarterly dividend, the dividend date, the volatility of the se- 
curity, the date the file was last updated, and the stock price at the last 
update. 

The program then requests volatilities to be used in subsequent cal- 
culations. If more than one option class is being analyzed, you may 
choose an average value, a higher value, or a lower value. Your choice 
will be contingent on your estimate of the security's future market 
performance. 

Now that all the data required has been input, a summary menu ap- 
pears and displays the information you've entered. If you wish to change 
a value or double-check an entry, this is the time to do it. Once you're 
satisfied, the analysis begins. 

SOAP prints a summary of the transactions to be analyzed. You tell 
it the number of days for which you'd like a projection. Ordinarily, your 
choice would be the number of days remaining on the earliest option. 

The standard deviation of the stock price projected is displayed. The 
range of prices to be analyzed will be plus and minus three times the stan- 
dard deviation. The calculations are performed using the logarithms of 
the prices and standard deviations.

During the main analysis phase, SOAP examines fifty-one different 
prices of the underlying security within the limits defined earlier. At each 
price, the program will calculate the fair price of each option class and 
the proceeds, including commissions, from closing that transaction. The 
net gain or loss at that price is calculated. Every fifth calculation is dis- 
played and you're shown the results of eleven computations. 

The probability of the occurrence of a particular stock price multi- 
plied by the option-dependent profit or loss is calculated. The sum of all 
fifty-one calculations is the statistically expected gain or loss for the in- 
vestment. If the end result is a gain, the annualized percentage rate of re- 
turn, based on both principal and the time period involved, is calculated. 

Graphic SOAPs. If you like, you can display the results of SOAFs 
analysis as a graph on the hi-res saeen. The vertical scale is the profit or 
loss in dollars. The horizontal scale represents the security's closing price. 
The profit or loss for plus or minus the three-standard deviation range 
comprises the rest of the plot. 

You can save the screen to disk and/or print it out. If you save it, the 
program checks to be sure that you haven't already saved a plot using 
this ticker symbol. If you have, you're asked if you want to overwrite the 
earlier plot or if you wish to change the name of the plot you're saving 
now; this ensures that you won't inadvertently destroy the earlier plot. 

The program then asks if there's another case to analyze. If so, it asks 
you to specify the security to be used; if you're using a new security, the 
entire input sequence begins again. 

Fixed Parameters. The fixed parameters file contains the investor's 
computer configuration. Information stored in this file includes the num- 
ber of disk drives available, whether or not a micromodem is being used 
(and, if so, what slot it's in), the local Dow Jones access number for the 
auto fetch module, the Dow Jones password, the log-on characters re- 
quired for the communications network used (Telenet or Tymnet), the 
printer slot and type, and the required printer control and graphics 
characters. 

SOAP is compatible with Trendcom 200 graphics and Apple Silen- 
type graphics. In order to print the hi-res screen graphics using another 
printer, you must enter the necessary instructions in the parameter file. 
Any command directly addressable through the Apple's keyboard may 
be sent. If your printer requires peek or poke setup commands, you'll 
have to save the hi-res graph to disk and print it out later using a graph- 
ics driver program. 

Control characters for the printer are then displayed in flashing mode 
until they have been verified by you. When you've entered all of the con- 
trol characters and verified them as correct, they will be saved to disk. At 
this point you may place a write protect tab on the program disk, since 
no other information needs to be recorded there. 

The documentation that accompanies the program contains two 
helpful appendixes. The first contains a sample case, which can be used 
as a sort of script to follow in learning to use the program, and the sec- 
ond is a well-written and comprehensible discussion of the theory under- 
lying the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Black-Scholes is steeped in 
theory, but it is not black magic. "The second appendix gives the less 
quantitatively oriented reader a feeling for what this technique does. 
"Three references that can help the investor understand option theory and 
options as a practical investment are also listed. 

Trapped Errors and Checked Ranges. Overall, SOAP is a good im- 
plementation of the Black-Scholes options analysis model. There are, 
however, a few things about the program that need to be improved. The 
ability to catalog the files on the disk from within the program is lack- 
ing, and error trapping and range chedcing for many of the inputs are in- 
adequate. Right now it's possible to put alphabetic characters into strict- 
ly numeric fields and numeric characters into fields designated alpha- 
tjetic. If you should do this, the program will continue until you run the 
analysis section, at which point you'll get an error message that refers 
you to the DOS 3.3. manual. A program should not refer the user to the 
manual for another program. It should either tell users what's wrong vis- 
a-vis the screen or refer them to its own manual. 

Investors should decide to buy SOAP or not based on their under- 
standing of options, option strategies, and the Black-Scholes pricing 
model. The program is reasonably priced and can be considered a useful 
analytical aid for the options trader.

Tools of the Craft, Part 21 

We've covered a lot of territory in the last couple of years, and have 
finally come to the end of the well-traveled segment of the Pascal Path. 
From this point on, we head into the dense underbrush, wherein lie all 
manner of interesting secrets and techniques, each waiting to be discov- 
ered and tamed by you, the bold and inquisitive programmer. Do those 
distant drums make you nervous? This is no place for the squeamish, you 
know; here you survive by sheer strength of will and speed of wit. If 
you're careful, you can return from your jungle sojourn a master of the 
Apple Pascal system. If not . . . well, there's no point in dwelling upon 
the unpleasant possibilities. 

As we proceed, you'd do well to keep eyes and ears open. Observe 
everything, and do your best to understand. For instance, taJce that snake 
on your right — the one swallowing its own tail. That's a recursive rep- 
tile. But you say the word recursion means nothing to you? Well, then, 
hold a moment and pay close attention. What you're about to learn 
could someday save the life of (or breathe new life into) your favorite 
program! 

Recursion: Passing Bucks and Peeling Onions. Many a problem or 
process is like an onion or a peail. Ether of these familiar objects consists 
of layers and layers of virtually identical material, all surrounding a 
small, simple core, or kernel. Each layer bears a straightforward rela- 
tionship to the one beneath it, except that the innermost layer is based on 
the kernel itself. 

Consider the mathematical operation, factorial. The exclamation 
point is used to signify factorials: "3!" is read as "three-factorial," "10!" 
as "ten-factorial," and so on. The factorial of a positive integer n is the 
product of all the integers from I ton, except that 0! is defined as 1. Thus, 
1! is 1; 2! is 1*2, or 2; 3! is 1*2*3, or 6; 4! is 1*2*3*4, or 24; and 5! is 
1*2*3*4*5, or 120. There is nothing mysterious about computing fac- 
torial values using Pascal; a FOR-loop is aptly suited to the task, as in 
the following function: 

FUNCTION 

Factorial(N: Integer) 
:lnteger; 
('AUTHOR: Jim Merritt 

VERSION: 1 .0 (1 -Jan-83) 

DESCRIPTION: Compute and return N! for all nonnegative N. Return 0 
for negative N, which is not mathematically correct, since the 
mathematical operator ! does not apply to negative numbers; still, 
the function has to return something in such cases. This version 
uses FOR-loop iteration to do the trick. *) 
VAR 

I, TempF 
:lnteger; 
BEGIN (* Factorial *) 
IF (N < 0) 
THEN 

Factorial : = 0 
ELSE 
BEGIN 



TempF := 1; (* 0! and 1! — trivial cases *) 
FOR I := 2 TO N DO 
TempF := TempF * I; 

(* Loop body won't execute if N = 0 or N = 1, leaving 
TempF as 1. *) 
Factorial := TempF; 
END; 

END (* Factorial *); 

The factorial operation, however, has an interesting, onionlike na- 
ture that suggests another method of computation. This deeper nature 
becomes clear after parentheses have been inserted at appropriate points 
vidthin the expression defining any particular factorial. Consider 5!, for 
instance: 

((((((1)*1)*2)*3)M)*5) 

By modifying this diagram slightly, we reveal that each layer of the 
factorial "onion" represents a valid factorial value in its own right, but 
only by virtue of building upon inner layers: 

[[[[[[0!]1!]2!]3!]4!]5!] 

The value of 5! depends on that of 41, which depends on that of 31, 
which depends on that of 2!, which depends on that of 1!, which de- 
pends on that of 0!, the kernel. This chain of interdependence between 
factorial values implies that the Pascal function Factorial might be writ- 
ten in the following fashion: 

FUNCTION 

Factorial(N: Integer) 
: Integer; 
(*AUTHOR: Jim fvlerritt 

VERSION: 1 .0 (1 -Jan-83) 

DESCRIPTION: Compute and return N! for all nonnegative N. Return 0 
for negative N. This version is recursive, and is not recommended 
for those subject to chronic dizziness. *) 
BEGIN (* Factorial *) 
IF (N < 0) 
THEN 

Factorial : = 0 
ELSE 

IF (N = 0) 
THEN 

Factorial := 1 
ELSE 

Factorial := N * Factorial(N- 1); 
END (* Factorial *); 

The new version of Factorial may be translated into somewhat un- 
wieldy English: "For any nonnegative integer n, the factorial ofn is equal 
to 1 ifn is zero: otherwise, it is equal to n multiplied by the factorial of one 
less than n." 

You wouldn't be alone in objecting to the definition of a function 
that calls itself. The human mind tends to reject such trickiness, brand- 
ing the reasoning behind it as invalid, or "circular." The apparent para-

dox impedes many an honest attempt to understand and apply the prin- 
ciples of recursion. 

Actually, however, there are no paradoxes in a properly constructed 
recursive routine, such as Factorial. All such routines are designed to 
handle hierarchical, "onionlike" problems, according to the principle of 
"simplify and pass the buck," which is a variation on "divide and con- 
quer." A recursive routine knows how to do three things: 

It can handle a very simple problem directly. For instance. Fac- 
torial can hand back the value of 0! without further computation. 

It can handle the level of problem complexity presented to it, so 
long as the issues at all lower levels have been resolved. Accord- 
ingly, Factorial can generate n\ if it knows the value of {n- 1 )! . 

It can identify and isolate the problem level that lies directly be- 
neath the current one, then call itself to handle this simpler situation. 
Action at the current level is postponed until the lower-level call is 
complete. Unable to generate the value of n\ directly, Factorial 
therefore issues the function call Factorial («— 1). 
Recursion works because (and only when) the chain of calls pro- 
duced by the "simplify-and-pass-the-buck" policy eventually leads to the 
trivial situation that the routine can handle directly. Finally, the routine 
is able to act, thus resolving the issues at the lowest level of concern. 
This, then, permits it to take action at the next higher level, and so on, 
until the original problem is solved. 

Going back to our "onion" analogy, each recursive call to Fac- 
torial "peels away" one layer of factorial computation until the trivial 
kernel operation, 0!, is exposed. This operation is performed expUcitly, 
without recursion, thus allowing the computation at the next higher level 
of complexity (that is, 1!) to proceed. When that level is reached, the 
result is passed to the next higher level (2!), and so on, until a correct 
value is returned for the original call to Factorial. 

The existence of the "trivial case" in any recursive definition acts as a 
brake for the recursive process, just as a termination condition or con- 
tinuation condition acts to halt iteration (looping). Clearly, a recursive 



routine must have some way to stop calling itself, or it will do so forever, 
in the same way that an uncontrolled loop will cycle endlessly. However, 
for reasons that will become clear momentarily, a "runaway" recursive 
routine cannot go on forever, the way a "runaway" loop can. 

Try rewriting Factorial without the IF— THEN clauses that deal with 
negative or zero values of n. In other words, modify the definition of Fac- 
torial so that, for any and all «, Factorial := «*Factorial(«— 1). This 
should produce "endless recursion." However, if you compile and 
execute the program, you'll see that the theoretically infinite recursion is 
cut short by the occurrence of a "stack overflow." (And, by the way, this 
will also clobber your system and force a reboot.) To see why this 
happens, read on! 

The Mechanics of Recursion. Many people like to think that recur- 
sion is a process whereby a routine can create and employ duplicates of 
itself, in order to whittle a large problem down to size by sheer strength 
of numbers. In view of our discussion so far, it is clear that this col- 
loquial definition, appealing and colorful though it may be, captures only 
some of the flavor of recursion. In truth, a recursive call does not spawn 
a copy of the recursive routine; the "original" is the only copy that exists 
in RAM at any time. So, how does recursion work at the level of the 
p-machine? 

It often helps to visualize the p-machine as an office clerk, modeled 
after Dickens's Bob Cratchit. This clerk does his job according to sev- 
eral instruction sheets, which he keeps in a binder on his desk. It goes 
without saying that he obeys any instruction faithfully, to the letter. 
Every time he starts a new job, he turns to the appropriate instruction 
sheet and pulls out a blank sheet of paper, on which he will do any fig- 
uring required to complete the task. 

Sometimes, an instruction will direct the clerk to carry out the task 
described on another sheet before proceeding with the task at hand. 
Whenever this occurs, the clerk first writes on the current sheet of scratch 
paper, indicating the instruction sheet that was being used, and the par- 
ticular instruction that was next in line, at the time the current task was

postponed. Then, he throws the scratch paper onto the pile of papers in 
his "things-to-do" box. Finally, he flips to the new instruction sheet, pulls 
out another blank sheet of scratch paper, and resumes work with the 
instruction at the top of the new sheet. 

Whenever the clerk carries out the last instruction on any given sheet, 
he throws away the current scratch paper and pulls a sheet of old scratch 
paper from the top of the pile in the "things-to-do" box. If the box is 
empty, of course, he waits patiently for more work, but let's assume that 
something is there. By reading the scratch paper, he determines which set 
of instructions corresponds to it. Then, he opens his binder to the appro- 
priate instruction sheet and resumes work at the point indicated on the 
scratch paper. However, before proceeding, he crosses out the reminders 
that helped him resume the postponed task, since they are now super- 
fluous. 

Except for the fact that the p-machine uses portions of semiconduc- 
tor RAM memory inside your Apple computer as its "instruction 
binder" and "scratch pad," it behaves very much like our highly method- 
ical clerk. In particular, it maintains a stack of "things to do," such that 
the last item thrown on the pile is the first to be retrieved. Instead of 
being called "scratch paper," though, each item is called a "stack frame." 

A stack frame contains space for a routine's parameters and local 
variables. If a routine must be postponed (that is, if another routine is 
called), information that permits the p-machine to resume the post- 
poned task is stacked on top of the current stack frame, and a stack 
frame for the newly called routine is constructed on top of that. Stack 
frames vary in size; the amount of memory occupied by a stack frame is 
only slightly larger than the amount of local storage required by the cor- 
responding routine. Note that a separate stack frame is constructed for 
every fUnction or procedure call, whether or not it is recursive. Every call 
starts with a "clean slate." 

It is the stack frame mechanism that facilitates recursion in the Apple 
Pascal system. Suppose for a moment that a chain of recursive calls 
artually did generate several "clones" of the calling routine. It stands to 
reason that the code for each "clone" would be identical to that of its 
siblings, since the same procedural instructions apply at any level of a 
recursive process. However, each of the several stack frames would differ 
from its fellows, because of the differences between the situations ad- 
dressed by each recursive call. In the case of Factorial, it is easy to see 
that at least the value of n must be different in each stack frame pro- 
duced during Factorial's chain of recursion. 

Since the difference between "clone routines" would amount only to 
a difference between their respective stack frames, a single copy of the 
recursive routine can appear as a group of "clones," if that single routine 
can be applied successively to the different stack frames the "clones" 
would use. This is exactly what happens inside the p-machine. One set of 
p-code instructions, corresponding to the definition of a recursive rou- 
tine, is applied to each of a chain of stack frames, one for each recursive 
level. 

Recursion versus Iteration. In theory, any program written using 
iterative methods — that is, explicit looping — may be rewritten to use 
recursion, and vice versa. Many programmers prefer to use recursive 
routines, because they are usually much more concise than equivalent 
iterative specifications. A recursive definition is generally very efficient in 
terms of saving programmer time. On the other hand, such a definition is 
usually wasteful of computer resources. Each recursive call requires RAM 
memory for its stack frame and related information. (This is why an 
"endlessly recursive" routine eventually causes a "stack overflow" — it 
eats all the remaining RAM in your Apple, and even asks for more!) 
Furthermore, the process of calling a procedure or function takes a finite 
amount of time, more time than that required to begin a new loop itera- 
tion. Thus, recursive routines tend to need more space and run more 
slowly than their iterative counterparts. 

To expedite program development and promote program clarity, any 
problem defined recursively should be solved using recursion; any that is 
defined iteratively should be solved using iteraUon. If a recursive routine 
ends up being too slow, or using too much RAM, you can always at- 
tempt to convert it to pure iteration. 

In practice, the conversion between iteration and recursion is often 
very difficult. Don't be lulled into a false sense of security due to the 



straightforward relationship between the iterative and recursive versions 
of Factorial; that example was deliberately chosen for its simplicity and 
transparency. The routine Permute, on the other hand, is a bit more 
complex. It generates and displays all the possible permutations (rear- 
rangements) of characters in an arbitrary character string S.

IF (InStr < > Empty) 
THEN 

Permute{Length(lnStr), Instr); 
UNTIL (InStr = Empty); 
END (* Permutations *). 

A call to Permute begins on the premise that it will display all per- 
mutafions of the first n characters in S. It proceeds to accompUsh this by 
leaving the «th character fixed in place, while it calls itself to display all 
the permutations of the first n— 1 characters. Then, for every character 
position, not including the nth, Permute exchanges the corresponding 
character with the nth one, displays all the permutations associated with 
the first n—l characters in the altered string, and finally undoes the al- 
teration, in preparation for the next iteration. Sooner or later, during the 
chain (or in this case, the "tree") of recursive calls, n will eventually be 1 . 
When this happens. Permute finds itself with nothing to rearrange; so it 
displays the entire String S, which at this point contains a unique permu- 
tation of the original S. 

If you find it difficult to agree that this procedure does indeed gen- 
erate all permutations of S without repeating any, you should enter, com- 
pile, and execute the program Permutations. Use a small string (three or 
four letters) as your test data. In order to appreciate fully the validity of

this method, however, you will probably have to put yourself in the role 
of the p-machine and try tracing the execution of the procedure Permute 
as it processes some representative input, such as the three-letter String 
'abc'. Tracing recursive routines can be tricky, so proceed slowly and 
carefully. To avoid getting lost, consult figure 1, which is a chronological 
summary of the major events that take place while Permute deals with 
the String 'abc'. Note that figure 1 is not a Pascal program listing, but an 
attempt to reflect the operation of Permute. Indentation has been sup- 
plied to help you distinguish between the various levels of recursion. 

Permute's recursive definition is concise and even elegant, but, as you 
can see from trying to trace the routine, its apparent simplicity is highly 
deceptive. To get a feel for the amount of computing power hidden in 
Permute's recursive calls, the fearless reader should attempt to rewrite the 
routine, without benefit of recursion! 

Before we press on, you who believe that Permute would be handy in 
solving anagram puzzles should be warned! A String of Length n has n\ 
unique permutations. Thus, the three-character String *abc' has 3!, or 6 
permutations; a six-character String has 6!, or 720 permutations; and a 
ten-character String has 10!, or 3,628,800 permutations! Because you 
anagram fanatics generally attempt to unscramble entire sentences, most 
longer than ten letters. Permute would probably be of little use to you.

Certainly it would be more fun for you to solve a long anagram in your 
head than to scan through a computer printout consisting of millions of 
possible solutions! As stated on the front cover of Apple's financial re- 
port for fiscal 1982, "Man is still the most extraordinary computer 
of all." 

A Promise Kept. We've explored the iterative conversion of Integers 
to character strings by writing such routines as IntegerOutput and 
IntToString. As you can see in the following version of IntegerOutput, 
certain data conversions may also be expressed recursively 

PROGRAM 
TestlntOut; 
PROCEDURE 

lntegerOutput(VAR 

OutFile 
: Interactive; 
Source 
: Integer); 
(* AUTHOR: Jim Merritt 
DATE: 1-Jan-1983 @ 3:03pm 
SYSTEM: Apple Pascal 1.1 

DESCRIPTION: Copies the character representation of Source to 
the specified Outfile . . . character representation begins with a 
hyphen if Source is negative, and is unsigned if Source is 0 or 
positive. WORKS FOR ALL POSSIBLE INTEGER VALUES. 
This routine uses recursion. *) 

CONST 

Base= 10; (* Base 10 arithmetic *) 

BEGIN (* IntegerOutput *) 

IF (Source < 0) (* is negative *) 
THEN 
BEGIN 

(* emit leading hyphen *) 

Write(OutFile, '-'); 
(* From now on, work only with magnitude *) 
Source := Abs(Source); 

END; 

IF ((Source DIV Base) > 0) 
THEN 

lntegerOutput(OutFile, (Source DIV Base)); 
(* Display rightmost digit *) 
Write(OutFile, Chr((Source MOD Base) + Ord('O'))); 

END ('IntegerOutput*); 
BEGIN (* TestlntOut *) 

lntegerOutput(Output, Maxint); 

WriteLn(Output); 

lntegerOutput(Output, 1); 

WriteLn(Output); 

lntegerOutput(Output, 0); 

WriteLn(Output); 

lntegerOutput(Output, -1); 

WriteLn(Output); 

lntegerOutput(Output, -Maxint); 

WriteLn(Output); 
END (* TestlntOut *). 

The recursive IntegerOutput is concerned only with the rightmost 
digit in the Integer that is presented to it. The routine "knows" that it 
should transmit this digit to the screen only after all remaining digits in 
the number have been displayed. So, it separates the digit for which it has 
responsibility from the bulk of the number. If that "bulk" is nonzero, 
then there are yet more digits to display, and IntegerOutput will call it- 
self to handle them. The "inward chain" of recursive calls to IntegerOut- 
put may be considered as a right-to-left scan of the original Integer I. Of 
course, once every digit in the number has been examined, the chain 
must be followed back out to the original call. At every link on the re- 
turn trip, a digit is displayed, in exactly the opposite order to which it was 
acquired. Since the digits were collected from right to left, they are dis- 
played in the normal fashion, from left to right. 

Because of its relative inefficiency, as compared to the iterative ver- 
sion, the recursive IntegerOutput is more a curiosity than a serious tool. 
It is presented here primarily because your Pathfinder, in one of his 
weaker moments several months ago, claimed it could be done, and 
promised to show you how "when the time came." Never let it be said 
that promises are ever broken along the Pascal Path! HI

MARCH 1983 \ O \- ^ M \i W 237 



San Francisco has long been known as a 
drinking town, but that convivial reputation 
was sullied on the night of September 5, 1982. 
Singer Mary Martin, the original Peter Pan, had 
come up from her home in Palm Springs to do a 
taping of her PBS show, Over Easy. The ses- 
sion behind her, she looked forward to good 
food and company as she and three old friends 
piled into the rear seat of a taxi and headed for 
Chinatown. They never made it. 

As the cab entered the intersection of Cali- 
fornia and Franklin streets, it was broadsided 
by a drunken driver — a speeding van that had 
run a red light. The impact was so great that it 
sent the taxi skittering eighty feet and into a 
tree, seriously injuring the four passengers. 
Martin, sixty-eight, suffered multiple rib and 
pelvic fractures as well as internal injuries. Her 
longtime friend, seventy-six-year-old actress 



Mission Emergency, specializes in multiple in- 
juries to bones, muscles, and joints, like the pel- 
vic fractures suffered by Martin and Gaynor. 

"Trauma is probably the least known and 
yet most serious health problem in the country 
today," he says. "We spend millions for re- 
search into heart disease and cancer, but in 
terms of real loss of comfort and of the produc- 
tivity of young individuals in our society, trau- 
ma is a worse culprit. It's the commonest cause 
of death among children." 

Trafton usually gets called when trauma vic- 
tims arrive with major open fractures. Such in- 
juries always pose a danger because infection 
could lead to the loss of a limb. 

"Many of the doctors doing trauma work 
are general surgeons," Trafton explains. 
"They're not specifically trained in the care of 
patients with musculoskeletal injuries." 



Opposite page: Peter 
Trafton's specialty gets 
down to bare bones. But 
liis tliinking is full- 
bodied. He uses Pie 
Writer to put his thought 
in a form publishers can 
understand and share. 
This page: Trafton's 
Apple, all decked out 
with Pie commands. 



Janet Gaynor, winner of the first best-actress 
Oscar, suffered eleven broken ribs, a severely 
damaged kidney, a perforated bladder, multi- 
ple pelvic fractures, and other injuries. Gay- 
nor's husband, impresario-producer Paul Greg- 
ory, had three broken ribs. Ben Washer, seven- 
ty-six, Martin's longtime associate and press 
agent, was dead. 

Mission of Mercy. The intersection of Cali- 
fornia and Franklin looked like a war zone. 
Tending the injured would require the same 
kind of battlefield medicine that doctors had 
perfected in Korea and Vietnam — immediate 
evacuation and treatment of the injured. With- 
in minutes of the accident, paramedic teams 
were rushing the victims to San Francisco Gen- 
eral Hospital's Mission Emergency. It wasn't 
the nearest hospital, but it was the best 
equipped to perform life-saving emergency sur- 
gery. Mission is San Francisco's designated 
trauma center and is to that city what the 451st 
was to troops in Korea — a kind of twenty-four- 
hour urban M.A.S.H. unit. 

Martin and Gaynor eventually recovered 
from their injuries. Martin, in fact, was back on 
her feet within two weeks, but victims of se- 
rious injuries don't always receive the intense 
team care provided by trauma centers. 

"Thirty to 40 percent of the trauma deaths 
in the country are probably preventable by trau- 
ma centers," says orthopedic surgeon Peter G. 
Trafton. Trafton, an orthopedic consultant to 
one of the round-the-clock trauma teams at 




tional research potential, Trafton decided to 
purchase a computer. The choice of an Apple 
was a simple one; choosing a word processor 
was more difficult. In the end, it was Pie that 
took the cake. 

"It was the description in TJie Book that 
made the difference," Trafton says. "It struck a 
subjective chord." 

After Trafton balanced price, power, and 
performance to the best of his ability, his choice 
was Apple Pie, then from Programma and now, 
in a recent upgrade with a change of name to 
Pie Writer, from Hayden. 

"The Pie Writer available now is a signifi- 
cant improvement over a product I was already 
quite satisfied with," Trafton says, noting that 
he was pleased to pay seventy-five dollars for 
the update. "I'm especially impressed with the 
attention the company's given to the questions 
I've had." 

Word processor users seem to fall for the 
first package they really get to know; Trafton is 
no exception. 

"I tend to look at Pie Writer's weaknesses 
and accept its strengths," he says, "and I'm so 
happy with its strengths that when I went to 
look at programs offering a little more space in 
memory I decided it wasn't worth the effort to 
learn the new one." 

Disk-Jockeying. Trafton's only complaint 
concerns the length of the binary text files that 
Pie Writer allows. He estimates that a file holds 
about three thousand of his polysyllabic medi- 



Trafton wears several hats at San Francisco 
General, a teaching hospital run under contract 
by the University of California at San Francis- 
co. In addition to advising the trauma team, 
Trafton performs surgery and, in his capacity as 
an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery, 
teaches at the affiliated med school campus 
across town. 

Trafton sees himself primarily as a teacher. 
He oversees residents in the orthopedic service 
and keeps staff and students abreast of what's 
happening in his innovative specialty, a disci- 
pline currently embroiled in a lively discussion 
of the pros and cons of treating multiple injur- 
ies surgically. Spreading the word under these 
circumstances becomes a full-time job, particu- 
larly given the publish-or-perish realities of aca- 
demic life for the untenured profs like Trafton. 

Rx for a Doctor's Dilemma. Two years 
ago, when Trafton was asked to contribute a 
chapter to a book on the complications of frac- 
tures, he found himself apparently facing the 
horns of a doctor's dilemma. He could dictate 
the chapter to the already busy secretary he 
shared with another staff member, or he could 
write the magnum opus by hand — a hand he 
admits that not even he can always read. 

Forced to look beyond the unacceptable 
horns, Trafton hit upon the idea of word proc- 
essing. Straight typing was not outside Traf- 
ton's purview; it was correcting and formatting 
that caused him problems, and word process- 
ing would solve these. Considering the addi-

cal terms — not enough for many of the techni- 
cal articles he writes. His book chapter, for ex- 
ample, filled a disk and a half. Jockeying among 
files can be a hassle when editing, Trafton con- 
cedes, but the program makes it so easy to link 
files during printing that it really doesn't matter 
much. 

"All I have to do is execute a simple com- 
mand and I can print a whole disk's worth with- 
out further attention." 

Pie Writer, back when it was Apple Pie, ac- 
quired a reputation for being one of the most 
difficult word processors to learn. But Trafton 
thinks much of its complexity has been elimi- 
nated in the update. Wherever possible, Hay- 
den simplified Pie's command structure to sin- 
gle and double keystrokes; there are still plenty 
of commands to learn, since the user formats as 
he goes by embedding text commands. A three- 
page, fold-out reference card helps the forgetful 
keep track of this impressive array of power. 
The card is helpful, but Trafton remains partial 
to the even friendlier stick-on key labels that 
came with the original program. 

Dualing Screens. The most striking feature 
of Pie Writer \s the way it appears on-screen. It 
creates the illusion of a printed page by using 
dashes to define a square. Text appears within 
this window, under which is a sill, or status line. 
On the status line are displayed the values for 
the cursor's position by line and column and for 
the case and mode. And Pie is unusual in one 
other respect: it has two screens. 

Pie was among the first word processors to 



offer primary and secondary screens to users of 
both forty and eighty column versions. Trafton 
picked the forty column package. This means 
he can use a normal forty column screen, in 
which the word-wrapping occurs at the normal 
end of the screen, or he can use the dual screens, 
in which case his text is spread horizontally 
across both screens. When a line of text reaches 
column thirty-nine of the first screen, the sec- 
ond screen is displayed and the line continues, 
wrapping at the end of the second saeen — back 
to the first. 

About the only time Trafton avails himself 
of the second screen is when he's writing a title 
that exceeds the row length of the single screen, 
an event that occurs usually when he's prepar- 
ing a slide presentation. 

Pie boots up with a system menu, but it's 
not truly a menu-driven program, Trafton 
points out. It's closer to free-form entry, with 
the user formatting by means of the embedded 
commands. A screenful of command-embed- 
ded text provides greater formatting versatility, 
but it resembles a cross between scientific nota- 
tion and stenographic hieroglyphics. 

Such an esoteric appearance may help ex- 
plain Pie's popularity among research types, but 
it's not likely to win converts among the type- 
writer-oriented. What it comes down to in 
visual terms is that what you see is not what you 
get — at least not in the text-entering mode. 
What you see is a lot of embedded commands; 
what you get is a custom-formatted page. 

Trafton professes to have no problems with

this minor inconvenience. By directing the for- 
mat mode to print only to the screen, he can 
preview the layout of a document to be 
printed — as it will appear on the page. Even 
here, there's the standard qualification: niceties 
such as underscoring and boldfacing don't 
show up. 

For Trafton, a big program plus is being able 
to designate the number of copies he wants 
printed. "Very often I'm producing something 
that needs to go to thirty-four residents," he ex- 
plains. "Rather than use a copy machine or get 
secretarial help, I run off thirty-four copies se- 
quentially." The principal drawback to that, of 
course, is having to endure the racket as the 



Olivieri's Outline 
of 

Word Processors 

by Peter Olivieri 



We're catching up, slowly but surely. This 
month's word processor profiles zero in on Pie 
Writer and Executive Secretary.

Processing with Pie. Pie Writer is a very 
thorough software package. Indeed, it is per- 
haps one of the more powerftil word process- 
ing programs we've considered so far. Before we 
go any further, however, one significant reser- 
vation about Pie Writer should be mentioned 
up-front, and that concerns the program's ease 
of use. 

A computer user who buys a word process- 
ing program should be able to count on getting 
clear, well-illustrated documentation of the pro- 
gram's capabilities. It can be very frustrating to 
find a powerful word processing package, one 
offering features that aren't commonly found 
in competing systems, only to discover after you 
buy it that the accompanying documentation 
doesn't clearly explain how to use the program. 

Unfortunately, Pie Writer's documentation 
fits this description. It's thorough, but it's not 
very easy to read and follow. This means that 
word processing users, especially those without 
a fair amount of computing experience, may 
find it difficult to get up and running with the 
program. Of course, various software packages 
(the DB Master database system, for example) 
require users to put in a lot of time and effort in 
order to take full advantage of their many fea- 
tures, so you might want to take all this with a

printer does its job. 

Moving in, out, and around files can some- 
times be a headache, but not with Pie, says 
Trafton. He can save portions of a text file or 
insert portions from another file simply by des- 
ignating b^inning and ending line numbers. 

What's My Line Number? The program 
uses line numbers to track the text entered on 
the screen or saved to disk. The numbers corre- 
spond to lines as they'd appear on the screen 
rather than as they'll appear on the printed 
page. This internal control makes for versatile 
block moves. Although the text editor's move 
buffer is limited to a single screen, designating 
line numbers overcomes that limitation and 



makes possible the juggling of whole pages from 
one end of a document to the other. 

In Trafton's opinion, versatility is the pro- 
gram's major strength. If you leave the editor 
and then come back to it, the cursor remains 
where you left it. Not only does Pie offer multi- 
ple tabbing, it also permits you to save any set 
of tabs you wish. And the same principle ap- 
plies to formatted files, which can be trans- 
ferred to disk exactly as printed out. If you want 
to mix text and columns of numbers by tog- 
gling in and out of word-wrap. Pie allows it. 

When Trafton wants to format slide pres- 
entations, he can reverse-indent to insert a cor- 
responding number in the left margin. More- 



over, Pie has also let Trafton talk to himself, in 
effect. He can write notes either in the margins 
or in the body of the text, and he can print these 
comments or not, as he chooses. 'This is voy use- 
ful when I want to remind myself where I ob- 
tained some material for an article but don't 
want to print it out," he says. 

So what is the doctor's diagnosis of Piel 
"It's a marvelous tool," Trafton says. "I bought 
a computer and a word processor thinking it 
would just make it easier to do rough drafts. To 
my amazement, I found I was able to produce 
perfect finished typewritten texts." 

And that, in word processors, is the bottom 
line. HI 



grain of salt. Despite the drawbacks in its docu- 
mentation. Pie WriterixxSt may be the best word 
processor for you. 

With that out of the way, let's look more 
closely at this comprehensive system. To begin 
with, some special features are worthy of men- 
tion. These include the ability to search for and 
replace strings (and to use "wild card" search- 
es), built-in list processing capability (often an 
add-on with other packages), the ability to print 
labels, and a built-in telecommunications pro- 
gram allowing you to transmit data over a mo- 
dem (unusual and nice). 

Another of Pie Writer's powerful features is 
its editor. While in the edit mode, you can con- 
trol the movement of the cursor up, down, left, 
and right; you can also move by spaces, words, 
line, or tab stop. 

It's easy to make insertions and deletions. 
You don't have to go through lots of intricate 
steps in order to insert text; rather, you can in- 
sert text anywhere simply by typing it. In fact, 
you can even define a key to contain a phrase 
and then have a line of text "open up" so that 
the phrase can be inserted. The back arrow has 
a backspace or erase feature that allows you to 
erase on a character-by-character basis, and it's 
also possible to delete words or lines. You can 
even specify that you want a range of lines to be 
deleted. This task, however, can take as many as 
eight or nine keystrokes. 

While in the edit mode, you can scroll by 
line, or by a number of lines of your choosing. 
Text can be copied into a buffer and moved to 
another spot in your document, it can be de- 
leted from the spot at which it was originally lo- 
cated, or, if you wish, the original can "stay be- 
hind." In this fashion, you can move up to 
twenty-one lines of text. You can search either 
forward or backward from the current cursor 
position for a particular word or phrase, and 
during this process you can replace the word or 
phrase with another of your choice. 

Pie Writer also provides impressive format- 
ting capabilities. You can configure your print- 
er and add any particular control characters 
you need in order to take advantage of its spe- 
cial features. This gives the package a great deal 
of flexibility. 

Pie Writer's format list is quite extensive. 
You can put titles on every page (headers or 
footers), number the pages, center, underline, 
print in boldface, and print in columnar for- 



mat. You can vary the margins on either side of 
your document, control indentation, and con- 
trol page length. And you can use single sheet or 
sprocket-fed paper. 

To enter formatting commands into a docu- 
ment, you precede a one or two-letter com- 
mand with a period. This is not an uncommon 
method of handling formatting commands, but 
not all users like it. 

Some auxiliary commands allow you to deter- 
mine how much space is left on your disk, get a 
catalog of the disk's contents, count the num- 
ber of words or lines in a document, delete files, 
and back up files. Various other disk com- 
mands are also available. 

In addition. Pie Writer permits you to enter 
a letter interactively; that is, while a document 
or letter is being printed you can cause the print- 
er to halt until you enter some text. That text is 
then inserted in the document being printed, 
and printing resumes. This is a nice feature. 

The documentation includes a very helpful 
picture of the keyboard, with all the keys rela- 
beled to reflect their word processing functions. 

As mentioned earlier, the rest of the docu- 
mentation is thorough, very detailed, and not 
quick and easy reading. The table of contents 
and the index are very complete, making it eas- 
ier for you to locate items that are of interest to 
you. However, there's plenty of information to 
absorb. 

All in all, Pie Writer is one of the most thor- 
ough word processing packages available. In- 
deed, for the knowledgeable computer user, it 
can perform many functions in addition to 
word processing. On the minus side, there's no 
question that learning to use this package well 
requires time and effort. For some people, this 
will be enough to discourage them from getting 
the package; for others, it will be a motivating 
force. 

The only other drawback worthy of men- 
tion is the number of keystrokes necessary to 
enter some of the commands. It's not unusual 
to have to type five or more keys to communi- 
cate a particular command. This is, at best, 
cumbersome. However, the extra features Pie 
Writer offers may override these concerns. For 
the more experienced user. Pie Writer just may 
be the best buy.

Since we always seem to be complaining 
about user manuals, it would be a mark of in- 
consistency if. we didn't call attention to a good 
one when it came along. The Executive Secre- 
tary manual certainly fills the bill. To begin 
with, it is professionally done. It comes in an at- 
tractive, rectangular-shaped notebook that 
stands up like an easel, making it easy to refer to 
while you're learning and working with the 
package. 

The first page of the manual describes how 
to get a free backup copy of the software, how 
to get a damaged disk replaced (for $7.50), how 
to get upgraded copies of the programs when 
enhancements have been made to it (also $7.50), 
and how to use the telephone support service 
Sof/Sys operates. 

The text of the manual is divided into twen- 
ty-five separate lessons. It is readable, easy to 
understand, and well organized. It is also at- 
tractively formatted, with different sizes of type 
and boldface printing contributing to a very ef- 
fective and helpful presentation of the material. 
(In fact, some school systems have even adopt- 
ed the guide as a classroom text.) 

In addition, the manual is thorough. It in- 
cludes a complete discussion of all the aspects of 
a professional word processing system and has a 
very complete index. 

Executive Secretary allows you to use the 
editor in either a typing mode or an editing 
mode. In the typing mode, the system works 
pretty much the way a standard typewriter does. 



Fast typists will have no problem using it, since 
the system reacts very quickly. While you're in 
this mode, the only way to make corrections is 
by backspacing and thereby erasing the text you 
backspace over. To make more extensive cor- 
rections, you'd have to switch over to the edit- 
ing mode. 

From the editing mode, it's easy to make 
changes in a document. Most of the commands 
are of the single-keystroke variety. For exam- 
ple, to add some text, you'd position the cursor 
at the point where you wish to add some text, 
type the letter A, and then add all the text you 
wanted to. When you'd finished adding text, 
you'd press escape. Most of the program's com- 
mands follow this same format; that is, the keys 
tend to represent the operation to be per- 
formed. 

The program features word wrap, global 
search and replace, and easy movement of 
blocks of text. In addition, it offers you the abil- 
ity to defme a two-letter sequence (preceded by a 
period) as a word or line of your choice. Then 
when you're typing text, you need only type the 
abbreviated sequence in order to have the word 
or line entered into the document. 

You can also adapt this system to your 
printer by embedding printer control com- 
mands in the text of your document. In fact, 
you may declare any two-letter sequence (again, 
preceded by a period) to be representative of a 
particular sequence of ASCII code.

age is quite powerful. It's here that you set mar- 
gins, determine the page length, and ^ecify the 
width of the lines. Lines of printed text can be 
indented, centered, and justified. In addition, 
page numbers can be placed wherever you wish 
on the page. All of these functions are accom- 
plished by means of essentially two-letter com- 
mands embedded in your document. 

It's also possible to insert prompt 
commands within a document so that the docu- 
ment will pause during printing and allow 
someone sitting at the Apple to enter text at that 
time. This capability can be very useful in a 
great many professional settings. In addition, 
you can preview final documents before print- 
ing them. 

Another handy feature is the ability to in- 
dex a document. In fact, if an entry to be in- 
dexed extends over two or three pages, the in- 
dex entry will so specify. This is a very impor- 
tant (and not very common) feature. 

Two other features are standard in the Ex- 
ecutive Secretary that aren't necessarily so in 
other packages. These are an electronic card file 
and a mailing list option. 

The electronic card file is essentially a data- 
base management system. Because it's part of 
the word processing package, you can extract 
information from the database for inclusion 
within a document. This is a very powerful fea- 
ture. Furthermore, Executive Secretary inter- 
faces with (talks to) several other database 
packages, including DB Master and The Data 
Factory. 

Of course, mailing hst merging is possible. 
What this means is that you can merge a list of 
names and addresses with a letter or document. 
In addition, a variety of conditional printing cri- 
teria can be specified. Such commands as and, 
or, not, if not, and and not are available. 

And there's more! The Executive Secretary 
has document transmission capability and is 
compatible with the Hayes Micromodem. 

The Executive Speller, a companion prod- 
uct, contains a list of more than ten thousand 
words. You can add your own words to this 
dictionary to create a lexicon of up to twenty- 
five thousand words. The package can then be 
used to check your document for any words 
that aren't spelled correctly. Once a possible 
misspelling has been idendfied, you have a va- 
riety of options, which include correcting the 
spelling, leaving the word as it is, and adding it 
to the dictionary. 

The only problems with Executive Secre- 
tary are relatively minor. The package doesn't 
support automatic hyphenation, which for 
some users could be a significant shortcoming. 
In addition, there's no provision for including 
footnotes in a document. Again, some users 
might find this unacceptable. 

In summary. Executive Secretary is an easy- 
to-use, well-done, professional package. Since it 
includes a database system and a mailing list 
system, it's pretty much a one-stop shopping 
package that addresses the most common word 
processing needs. It should certainly be one of 
the packages you consider.

Exploring Business Basic, Part 18 



Looking through a Glass Backward. Last 
month's article was a lengthy tome on editing 
character fonts and shapes, delivered with the 
promise that it could be used to create "fun 
stuff." What else justifies having to type in such 
a long program? That program, or something 
equivalent, is going to become pretty important 
this time, as we continue our discussions of 
graphics by developing an arcade shoot-'em-up 
called Bug-Mania. In the process, we'll explore 
an area of graphics that most people overlook, 
the forty-column color-on-color text mode. 

Now that we can create special character 
shapes and load them into the standard charac- 
ter set, a class of graphics known as "character 
set animation" is not only possible but highly 
practical and rewarding. Most people don't re- 
alize it, but the capabilities of the Apple II DOS 
Tool Kit package, Animatrix, program are sup- 
plied as standard in the Apple III and work at 
hardware speeds! However, to make all this 
neat stuff really work for you, you need a char- 
acter set editor such as the one discussed last 
time. If you don't have last month's article, you 
can still use the programs, but they won't make 
much sense, and they certainly won't be pretty. 

Since last month's article was written, a set 
of Business Basic invokable modules called Ba- 
sic Extension has appeared on the market from 
Foxware Products of Salt Lake City, Utah. In 
addition to routines to manipulate and search 
arrays, it contains useful functions such as reset 
lockout, reboot, upshift, and, most significant 
to last month's article, the ability to change file 
types. Specifically, the editor from the last arti- 
cle can be modified with this routine to change 
the edited font file automatically to the system 
file-type font, so that it can be used by other sys- 
tem procedures. This allows you to edit a font 
and then configure it with SCP. Congratula- 
tions, Foxware! 

Doing the Sideways Scroll. One of the 



critical elements of any shoot-'em-up game is 
the ability to keep more than one activity going 
on the screen simultaneously. This means that 
the targets should move as well as the weapons, 
and firing at objects should not bring every- 
thing to a halt. Since each of these activities 
takes some processing time, it is important that 
each be accomplished as quickly as possible in 
order to make the whole game smooth and fast. 

Normally on the Apple II and other similar 
systems, this speed is accomplished with assem- 
bly language routines, which execute fast 
enough to make up for the fact that it takes a lot 
of work to move objects around on the hi-res 
screen. Careful use of the Apple III built-in rou- 
tines and the user-definable character set will al- 
low us to do much the same thing in Basic. To 
begin, let's look at a routine that scrolls objects 
horizontally across the text screen. We'll start 
with groups of asterisks (realizing that we could 
redefine them to almost any shape). 

The program looks like this: 



10 


^j^.. .* **** ** *... ... . .... .. ..... 


20 


start$ = CHR$(26)+CHR$ 




(0) + CHR$(10) 


30 


PRINT CHR$(21);"1"; 


40 


PRINT CHR$(16);CHR$(1); 


50 


PRINT CHR$(19);CHR$(4); 


60 


PRINT CHR$(20);CHR$(13); 


70 


HOME 


80 


FOR 1 = 0 TO 39 


90 


PRINT start$;MID$(m$,41-i,i) 




;MID$(m$, 1,40-1) 


100 


GET a$:IF ASC(a$) = 27 THEN 130 


110 


NEXT i 


120 


GOTO 80 


130 


TEXT:HOME 


140 


END 


Line 


10 defines a forty-character string, 



exactly as wide as the screen mode we will use. 
Be sure when you type it in that the result is 
exactly forty characters in length. Line 20 puts a 
starting location to display the strings on the 



screen into startS, using the cursor positioning 
command of the console driver. The code 
shown will set a starting location at column 0, 
row 10. Line 30 sets the cursor movement op- 
tions to disable everything but "advance after 
character." You should check out the Standard 
Device Drivers Manual for more details on the 
cursor options of the Console Driver. Line 40 
puts the screen into forty-column color text 
mode, and lines 50 and 60 set the foreground 
color to dark green (4) and the background col- 
or to yellow (13). The home command sets the 
whole screen to the background color, and then 
the routine to scroll m$ begins in line 80. 

It is important to go through the routine in 
lines 80 through 110 to see how this accom- 
plishes the display of the string m$. For each 
value of i, the string is split into two parts, on 
the boundary between the beginning and end of 
the string. When i equals 0, the result is 
MID$(m$,41,0);MID$(m$,l,40). This is the 
combination of a null string together with the 
entire string (1 ,40). When i equals 1, the combi- 
nation is MID$(m$,40,l);MID$(m$,l,39), that 
is, the last character of the string, coupled with 
the first thirty-nine characters. The end of the 
sequence, where i equals 39, is equivalent to 
MID$(m$,2,39);MID$(m$,l,l) and finishes ro- 
tating the string around to start again. The get 
statement in line 100 allows the display to freeze 
after each step, so you can see exactly how this 
works. To see the effect of the scrolling, simply 
hold down any key (except escape) and the pat- 
tern will scroll rapidly to the right. Holding 
down the closed-Apple key in combination with 
the other key will cause faster scrolling (since 
the characters are presented to get faster). If you 
want to see how fast this thing will really run, 
cut out line 100 completely. Those asterisks will 
really fly! 

Line 130 is important since it snaps you 
back to eighty-column reality with the cursor 



options restored. 

Well, so much for the simple stuff. Now it's 
time to add the options to create objects and 
creatures of your own to populate your game 
world. 

"Oh Scroll a Mio." We'll start by defining 
the characters that will bring our creature to life. 
To make things interesting, we'll use two ver- 
sions of the bug to produce some simple ani- 
mation without getting too complicated. We'll 
redefine the characters from decimal 20 through 
25 to be our graphics characters. These are nor- 
mally control characters and aren't displayed 
unless referenced by their character number 
plus 128, that is, decimal 148 through 153. This 
prevents the animation characters from inter- 
fering with any other normal characters we 
may have to print. If you haven't seen the last 
issue, and don't have access to a character set 
editor, you may simply use the same character 
numbers without changing their definition, but 
the creatures on the screen won't make much 
sense. 

In any case, figure 1 offers a suggestion for 
the bug set. 

Creepy, right? Actually, you can probably 
create a better-looking bug than this, so play 
around with the editor until you are satisfied. 
Watch the "280 x 192" window on the editor to 
get an idea of how your creature will look in 
forty-column mode. The changes from the set in 
characters 20 through 22 to the set in 23 
through 25 are designed to make the mouth

open and close, the legs move, and the tail wag! 
TTiis is the basic concept of character set ani- 
mation; the animation of an object is accom- 
plished by displaying several related versions of 
the object rapidly on the screen as characters. 

Since the shapes will be displayed as a char- 
acter font, remember the rules for character 
fonts: Use the first seven dot positions only (the 
eighth is used for a flash/no flash flag in in- 
verse mode and will not be displayed) and make 
sure the characters are no more than eight dots 
high. Save the character set using the font op- 
tion, with any name you like. If you have a way 
to change the resulting file to the official font 
type (via the invokable module discussed ear- 
lier, or the Pascal System Filer), do so now. This 
will save some hassles later. 

Can't Tell One Bug from Another without 
a Program. Now for a program that will dis- 
play these characters on-screen and accomplish 
the animation! We'll use the scroll technique 
from the last program, together with character 
strings made up of our new character font. 

10 DIM a%(511),char$(3) 

15 q$=CHR$(34):esc$ = CHR$(27) 

:slen=40 

20 array$ = "a%":char$(0)=" " 

25 text40$ = CHR$(16)+CHR$(0) 

30 b$ = " ":b2$ = " ":b3$ = " " 

35 INVOKE'VBASIC/download.inv" 

40 INPUT"Name of font file: ";flname$ 

45 name$=^q$+flname$+q$ 

50 INPUT"Line number to crawl on: ";1 

55 tc$=CHR$(26)+CHR$(G)+CHR$(1) 

These lines do the initialization of several ar- 
rays and values. Note that the array a% is di- 
mensioned to hold an entire character set, 
which Download.inv will load off disk. You'll 
have to change the pathname of Download.inv 
to be correct on your own system. In addition, 
text40$ contains the console commands to turn 
on forty-column black-and-white mode (mode 
0), and tc$ contains the cursor addressing com- 



mand to position the cursor to row 0, line 1, 
using the line number that was input in line 50. 

60 char$(1)=CHR$(148):char$(2) 

= CHR$(149):cha.r$(3)=CHR$(150) 
65 m$ = ".23... 123.1223.. 13. 

123.3. 23. ..123. 1223.." 
70 FOR i=1 TO 40:SUB$(m$,l,1)=char$ 

(VAL(MID$(m$,i,1))):NEXT i 
75 char$(1)=CHR$(151):char$(2) = CHR$ 

(152):char$(3) = CHR$(153) 
80 n$ = ".23... 123. 1223. .13. 123.3.23 

...123.1223.." 
85 FOR 1=1 TO 40:SUB$(n$,i,1) = 

char$(VAL(MID$(n$,i,1))):NEXT i 

Lines 60 through 85 look complicated, but 
they are simply the instructions on how to set 
up the strings to be scrolled across the screen. 
First, line 60 creates values in the charS array 
that correspond to the pieces of our first bug. 
Then the m$ string in line 65 tells what piece to 
put in what position. This allows us to create 
bugs that consist of a head only, a head and a 
tail, a head, body and tail, or any combination 
our imagination permits. The periods in be- 
tween the numbers are simply place-holders, 
which have a value of 0. Remember that we as- 
signed a space to char$(0). Line 70 reads the val- 
ues in m$. one chararter at a time, and substi- 
tutes the appropriate value from the charS ar- 
ray. Then lines 75 through 85 do the same thing 
for a second string, n$, which will contain the 
shifted versions of our bugs. Although we kept 
the bug structures the same in m$ and n$, noth- 
ing prevents us from redefining even the length 
of the shapes from one string to the next. This 
would allow us to aeate bugs such as caterpil- 
lars, which move by shortening and lengthen- 
ing their bodies! 

90 PERFORM getfont(@name$,@array$)

earlier, set up the screen mode, load the font in- 
to the standard character set, and turn off all 
screen options except advance, allowing us to 
write to the screen without interference from 
sCToUing. 

If you used the font editor from the last is- 
sue, or some other font editing technique, and 
cannot change the saved file as an official sys- 
tem type font (as shown by the catalog listing), 
you must make some modifications to what's 
been described so far. The changes are: 

35 INVOKE "/BASIC/download.inv", 

"/BASIC/request.inv" 
90 0PEN#1,name$:PERF0RM 

filread(%1,@array$,%1024,@ret%) 
92 IFret%<>1024THEN PRINT"Nota 

font file":GOTO 40 
Remember, make these changes if you use 
the font editor from the last article and cannot 
change the saved file type to font. And now, on 
with the show. ... 

110 FOR i = 0 TO 39 STEP 2 

115 PRINT tc$;MID$(m$,slen+ 1-1,1); 

MID$(m$,1,slen-i) 
120 GET z$:IF z$=esc$ THEN 200 
125 PRINT tc$;MID$(n$,slen-i,i+1); 

MID$(n$,1,slen-i-1) 
130 GET z$:IF z$=esc$ THEN 200 
135 NEXT i 
140 GOTO 110 

Lines 1 10 through 140 are the main scrolling 
loop. As you can see, it looks basically (heh, 
heh) like the lines in the last program, with sev- 
eral important differences. Since we have two 



strings to print, we cut the number of iterations 
in half, and we adjust the subscripts in each 
MID$ function to print successive strings in the 
sequence. We still use the get statement to pause 
between each change, but now it permits us to 
see the animation as it progresses. Again, hold- 
ing down any key will permit smooth scrolling 
and motion as the little creatures open and shut 
their mouths, move their legs, and wag their 
tails. 

200 PRINT CHR$(21);" = "; 

205 PRINT CHR$(22);CHR$(14); 

210 TEXT:HOME 

215 name$=q$+"/BASIC/standard"+q$ 
220 PERFORM 

getfont(@name$,@array$):PERFORM 

loadfont(@array$) 
225 PRINT CHR$(15); 
230 END 

Lines 200 through 230 perform cleanup, but 
in this case there's more to clean up than be- 
fore. After setting console options back to nor- 
mal (line 200), line 205 shuts off the screen while 
the cleanup is being done. The CHR$(22) is 
there to synchronize shutting off the screen with 
vertical blanking, avoiding funny flashes on the 
screen. Line 210 restores the eighty-column 
screen and clears it to blanks, and then lines 2 1 5 
through 225 restore the standard character set 
and turn the screen back on. You should 
change the pathname to the name of the char- 
acter set you normally use. 

So much for the example program. When 
you run it, the creepy creatures should crawl 



across the screen at your command. It's fun to 
elaborate on this program by editing more com- 
plex characters or creating more versions df 
them to get smoother animation. In fact, the 
Running Horse demo on the System Demo disk 
was done somewhat in this way. 

Business Basic Gets a Little Gamey. By 
now we've covered the essentials necessary for 
you to follow the discussion of the arcade type 
game below. Basically, we're going to take our 
scrolling creatures and make them targets in a 
shooting gallery ("Oh, no," you cry, "not our 
poor creatures!"). To be a little fairer, we'll put 
some moving obstacles between the shooter and 
the creatures and deduct points when the bul- 
lets hit the obstacles. Both the creatures and the 
obstacles will be moving using the techniques 
from the previous program. In addition, every 
good game needs some sound effects. We'll use 
the .audio driver to make some tones to liven up 
the game. With that said, let's look at the game:

Lines 60 through 80 set up additional vari- 
ables and strings needed for the program. In 
particular, the lin$ array contains various ver- 
sions of the characters used to represent a shot 
being fired at the creatures. It is made up of sets 
of vertical bars (the "1" character) combined 
with the vertical tab character contained in the 
bu$ string. Vertical tab is used because the shot 
is fired from the bottom of the screen toward 
the top. Each string in the array is prefixed by 
the na$ string, containing the screen control 
codes to turn off character advance. This comes 
in handy in printing vertically, since it is only 
necessary to go up after printing, not back up 
and then go up, as would be true if advance 
were on. Anything that reduces the number of 
characters printed on the screen speeds up the 
action. Notice also that lin$(0) has an asterisk as 
the last character. This represents a burst as the 
shot goes through the barrier and explodes. By 
adding some extra characters, you could make 
the line and the burst different colors. Line 75 
defines blk$, which erases a shot right after it's 
fired. This gives the impression of a quick blast 
from the gunner. Notice that av$ is added to the 
end of each occurrence of blk$ to turn advance 
back on. 

Line 80 sets up the values for the routine 
that decodes keystrokes and decides what to do. 
More on that later.

Lines 90 through 1 10 set up the scrolling 
barriers. E$ and f$ can be any arrangement you 
like, but be sure to make them exactly forty 
characters long. Notice that, instead of waiting 
and performing the MID$ functions when the 
string is actually printed on the screen, they are 
done in this loop and the results stored in string 
arrays to be printed later. Since these strings 
won't change, this is a more efficient, and there- 
fore faster way to handle them. Line 110 han- 
dles this straightforwardly, but lines 100 and 
105 create dq$ and eq$ in a more confusing 
way. Basically, the process is this: dq$ and eq$ 
contain every other occurrence of e$, the string

of a creature. T4$ contains the position of the

firing of lin$ takes place. 

Now we're ready to look at the additional 
setup subroutines. The first, at line 700, loads 
the font of our choice. It looks very similar to 
the routine from last time: 

700 INPUT"Name of font file: ";flname$ 
705 name$=q$-l-flname$-l-q$ 
710 PERFORM getfont(@name$,@array$) 
715 RETURN 

Again, if you can't change your edited font 
files to type font, make the changes in this rou- 
tine that were suggested in the last program. 

The routine at line 800 is used to set up the 
bug character strings. It is derived from the last 
program and looks like this: 

800 temp$ = ".12...123.1234..12. 

123.1. 12,. ,123.1234.." 
805 char$(1)=CHR$(148):char$ 

(2) = CHR$(149):char$(3) 

= CHR$(150) 
810 m$(0) = ".23... 123.1223.. 13. 

1 23 3 23 123 1223 " 
820 FOR 1 = 1 TO 40:SUB$(m$(0), 

i,1) = char$(VAL(MID$ 

(m$(0),i,1))):NEXT i 
830 char$(1) = CHR$(151):char$ 

(2) = CHR$(152):char$(3) 

=CHR$(153) 
840 m$(1) = ".23... 123.1223.. 

13.123.3.23.. .123.1223.." 
850 FOR 1=1 TO 40:SUB$(m$(1), 

i,1)=char$(VAL(MID$(m$(1), 

i,1))):NEXT i 
855 FOR 1=1 TO 40:m(i)=VAL 

(f\/1ID$(temp$,i,1)):NEXT i 
860 RETURN 

The only real difference between this sec- 
tion and the same function of the last program 
is in lines 800 and 855. These lines combine to 
create the array m, which is used to score hits 
and quickly decide how long an individual crea- 
ture is. The game uses the principle that if you 
hit a creature you destroy everything from the 
point of impact back, but whatever's left in 
front of the hit keeps going. We'll see exactly 
how this is done later. 

The last setup routine creates the screen and 
playing area. 

600 PRINT CHR$(14); 
605 PRINT text40$;bw$;:HOME 
610 PERFORtvl loadfont(@array$) 
615 PRINT av$;:REM turn everything off but 
advance 

630 PRINT og$;:PRINT USING"40c";b$

655 PRINT t5$;points;" "

660 PRINT bw$;t4$;" X "; 

665 PRINT CHR$(15); 

670 RETURN 

First the screen is turned off, so the setup 
can be completed quickly and without being 
seen. Then forty-column color mode (blue on 
white) is chosen and the screen is cleared to 
white (line 605). The font is then loaded as the 
standard character set, and various parts of 
the screen are filled in using orange-on-green

Getting Under Way in Bugland. The preced- 
ing gets us ready for the actual playing proce- 
dures. To make the game fun, we want to have 
scrolling and player motion taking place all at 
once. As we have seen in previous articles, the 
best way to tackle that is the ON KBD capa- 
bility, where the Apple III can be doing some- 
thing but still respond when a key is pressed. 

190 ON KBD GOTO 300 

200 FOR i = 0 TO 39:c=(i/2=INT 

(i/2)):g=(MID$(fq$(i),hr,1)<> 

b$)+(MID$(eq$(i),hr, 

1) <> b$r2:PRINT tc$;MID$ 

(m$(c),slen+1-i,i);MID$ 

(m$(c),1,slen-i);t2$;dq$ 

(i);t3$;fq$(i);t2$;eq$ 

(i):NEXT:GOTO 200 

Line 190 sets up an ON KBD jump to 300 
when a key is pressed. In the meantime, line 200 
is continuously executed. This is a complicated 
routine, so let's look at each part of the line. 
First, the scrolling loop is set up as before. 
Then a value for c is calculated. C will be 0 if i is 
odd, 1 if i is even. This allows us to choose 
which version of the creatures we will display on 
this round. Then g is calculated. G is a number 
that indicates what the state of the barriers is. 
When you analyze the complicated logical ex- 
pression, you will find that g is 0 if both fq$ and 
eq$ are blank at the current location of hr (the 
gunner's position). This would indicate that the 
barriers are open at that spot. G is equal to 1 if 
the bottom barrier (fq$) is closed, and 2 if the 
top barrier (eq$) is closed. If both barriers are 
closed, then g is 3. This will affect scoring, as 
we'll see later. We really only need to calculate g 
when a shot is fired, but we've got time to waste 
in this loop. We'll need every millisecond when 
the shot is actually fired to avoid slowing down 
the animation. 

Next the appropriate version of the crea- 
ture string is printed, and then the barrier 
strings are printed. Notice that printing dq$, 
fq$, and eq$ (in that order) has the effect of 
SCToUing the top barrier twice as fast as the crea- 
tures, in the same direction, and scrolling the 
bottom barrier at the same speed. Because of 
the way fq$ was created, the bottom barrier ap- 
pears to scroll backwards. After scrolling 
through the entire m$ array, the routine goes 
back and starts over endlessly, until a key is 
pressed. 

Which brings us to the ON KBD routine at 
line 300: 

300 OFF KBD:z= KBD 
305 ON j(z) GOTO 400,330, 

340,150,170,500 
310 ON KBD GOTO 300 
315 RETURN 

First we turn off the keyboard interrupt, 
and assign z the ASCII value of the character 
typed. This is used in line 305 to determine 
which processing routine to jump to. Check the 



definition of the j array in line 80 for more in- 
formation about what is happening. This tech- 
nique of branching is very wasteful of space (the 
j array takes up IK of memory) but is extremely 
fast, which is what we need in processing these 
keystrokes. Cross-referencing line 80 tells us that 
the jump to line 400 occurs if z equals 32 (space 
bar). This is the firing signal. Lines 330 and 340 
process right and left arrow keys (ASCII 8 and 
21, respectively), which are used to move the 
gunner around. A return (ASCII 13) jumps 
back to line 150 to begin a new game, and an 
open-Apple return (ASCII 141) restarts with 
doubled point and penalty values. Finally, an 
escape (ASCII 27) jumps to 500 and ends the 
game. Looking at these individual routines will 
end our discussion of this game and get us down 
to playing it. 

330 hr=hr-(hr>2):G0T0 350 

340 hr=hr + (hr<39) 

350 SUB$(t4$,2,1) = CHR$(hr-2) 

:SUB$(t6$,2,1)=CHR$(hr-1) 

:PRINT t4$;" X " 
360 ON KBD GOTO 300 
370 RETURN 

This sequence simply resets the value of hr 
after being sure that hr is not already at the left 
or right edge. You could reduce these values to 
restrict the gunner to a certain section of the 
screen. Line 350 changes the values of t4$ and 
t6$ to represent the new value of hr and re- 
prints the gunner with spaces on each side. 
Printing the spaces erases the previous image of 
the gunner in the old position, no matter which 
way he moved. Then the ON KBD statement is 
reactivated, and the routine returns to the loop 
at 200. 

400 IF i = 40 THEN 460 
405 PRINT t6$;lin$(g); 

t6$;blk$(g) 
410 IF g THEN points = points 

-pnts(g):PRINT#1; 

beep$(g):GOTO 450 
415 ch = slen*(i >hr)+hr-i 
420 IF NOT m(ch) THEN PRINT#1 

;beep$(g):GOTO 450 

:ELSE:PRINT bell$; 
425 FOR j = ch TO ch-m(ch)+1 

STEP-1:IF m(j) 

THEN points=points+m(j) 

*hit:m(j) = 0:NEXT 
430 SUB$(m$(0),j+1,ch-j)=" " 

:SUB$(m$(1),j+1,ch-j)=" " 

:hits=hits+ 1 
450 PRINT og$;t5$;points;" " 

;t7$;hlts;bw$ 
460 ON KBD GOTO 300 
470 RETURN 

Lines 400 through 470 are the firing sub- 
routine, and this is where all the action takes 
place. First, a check is made to see if the key- 
stroke occurred during the loop exit and restart 
time. If so, a return is made with no action 
taken. This rarely happens, but must be pro- 
vided for. Next, the gun is fired, by printing lin$ 
and blk$ at the current gunner location. Then g 
is checked to see if the bullet struck a barrier. If 
so, the appropriate number of points is deduct- 
ed and a tone is sounded, with pitch corre- 
sponding to which barrier was struck. Then a 
jump is done to 450 to print the new point 



values and return. 

If g equals 0, then the bullet made it through 
the barriers; a check is made in lines 415 and 420 
to see if anything was hit. If the m array con- 
tains 0 at that point, then the shot was a miss; 
the appropriate tone is sounded and a return is 
made. If m is not zero, then a machine bell is 
sounded (note that a bell character sounds with- 
out slowing down the program as a tone does). 

Line 425 then backs up along the string add- 
ing up points and zeroing out the m array. Line 
430 blanks out the appropriate parts of the m$ 
strings and bumps the hit count. With the 
strings changed, the next printing of m$ will 
erase the bug from the point of the hit back- 
wards. Line 450 then prints the new score, and 
play resumes. 

Notice that the major work of the game is 
done in this routine. Anything that makes this 
routine simpler or faster has the effect of speed- 
ing up play, and making the game more fun. 

This finally brings us to the last routine, 
which ends the game: 

500 PRINT CHR$(21);" = " 

505 PRINT CHR$(22);CHR$(14); 

510 TEXT:HOME 

515 nam$=q$ + "/BASIC/ 

standard" +q$ 
520 PERFORM getfont(@nam$, 

@array$):PERFORM 

loadfont(@array$) 
525 PRINT CHR${15); 
530 CLOSEilNVOKE 
540 END 

This is essentially identical to the routine 
used in the previous program. 

A Game a Day Keeps Pac-Man Away. Sure, 
this game won't save you many quarters if 
you're an arcade freak, and it's not exactly go- 
ing to drive Bill Budge out of business, but the 
techniques may prove useful, and prove some- 
thing else as well. You don't need assembly lan- 
guage to get reasonable performance out of the 
Apple III, even in games, a realm of program- 
ming thought absolutely to require it. If you're 
careful, use clever techniques, and remember 
that you can trade off memory space for addi- 
tional speed by using tables, you can create 
some interesting things. There is certainly a lot 
you can do to make this game more interesting 
too. Try to figure out how to have the bug 
heads dive down through the barrier and at- 
tack the gunner when their bodies have been 
blown away. You might also try to speed up the 
scrolling by printing just one-third of the gun 
blast at a time, with scrolling in between, and 
then figure the hit out at the end of the process. 
This would look more natural and require the 
gunner to "lead" the target, quite a challenge. 
You can also change the scoring rules to your 
liking and, of course, completely redefine the 
barriers and bug shapes. Have fun! 

Next month we'll add smooth scrolling to 
this game with the character download capa- 
bility. That's the real way the Horse Demo 
works. In addition, we'll start our exploration 
of how these techniques, and some brand-new 
ones not possible in text mode, can be imple- 
mented on the hi-res graphics screen. Until 
then, blaze away! n

beginners' 
Corner 




BY (HRISTOPHER U. LICHT 



As we have noted in previous months, even beginners who have no 
intention of ever writing their own Basic programs — much less machine 
language ones — can benefit from a little knowledge of machine lan- 
guage. Having such knowledge makes it easier to use many of the var- 
ious available commercial packages to the fullest. 

It can also be useful to know where in memory Apple's designers 
chose to put things so you'll know where it's safe to put other things. 
We'll spend this month taking a cartographic expedition through mem- 
ory. Because the Apple II Plus with 48K of memory has been the stan- 
dard machine for a couple of years, we're going to assume that that's the 
one you have. 

To begin with, you're probably aware that 16K, 32K, and 64K don't 
really mean 16,000, 32,000, and 64,000 bytes. They're a convenient short- 
hand that understates the true figures. The actual numbers of bytes are 
two to the fourteenth (16,384), two to the fifteenth (32,768), and two to 
the sixteenth (65,536). Because the computer internally uses the binary 
number system and has to translate to decimal, it sees these numbers as 
nice round figures. They only seem strange to us. 

Counting the Ks. You may or may not be aware that your 48K 
Apple is actually a 64K machine. Its 6502 microprocessor can read from 
and write to a full 65,536 bytes of memory. The 48K refers to the amount 
of RAM memory, but there's also 16K of ROM, in which Applesoft and 
the Monitor are stored. However, because the programs controlling 
Applesoft and the Monitor are embedded in their own set of chips to 
prevent the user from overwriting those programs, only the 48K bytes of 
RAM can be controlled by the user. 

The terms RAM and ROM refer to the two types of internal mem- 
ory of the Apple. RAM is the memory to which the user has complete 
access. That is, individual bytes of RAM can be read from and written 
to. The acronym stands for random access memory. Random access 
means that each byte has an address assigned to it, and that the user, or a 
program, can look at any byte without having to deal with the sur- 
rounding bytes. 

ROM stands for read-only memory. One confusing thing about these 
terms is that ROM is also random access. Any byte within a bank of 
ROM can be read by referring to its address without having to read the 
surrounding bytes. What distinguishes ROM from what we call RAM is 
that ROM cannot be written to, and ROM can hold its data even after 
the power has been turned off. That is because the data stored in 
ROM— in the Apple, the programs that operate Applesoft and the 
Monitor— is permanently burned in at the factory. Barring some kind of 
physical damage to the chip, the data in ROM can't be erased, and it 
can't be overwritten by other data under any circumstances. 

As we mentioned briefly last month, the Apple's memory is divided 
into 256 pages, each containing 256 bytes. This convention is used be- 
cause 256 is to hexadecimal (base 16) what 100 is to decimal (base 10). 
Just as the latter is 10 tens, the former is 16 sixteens. 

One eight-bit byte in Apple's memory can store one of 256 (or 2*) dif- 
ferent values. These values can represent decimal numbers 0 through 255 
or hex numbers $0 through $FF. Alternatively, depending on the con- 
text, they can represent alphanumeric characters, graphic displays, line 
numbers, Basic or machine language commands, and other things. 

The Logic of the Machine. Although the page system doesn't have 
any particular logic in decimal notation, it is logical in hex. Each byte is 



addressed with a four-digit hexadecimal number. A new page begins 
whenever the third digit from the right in the hex address is incremented 
by one. Thus, page zero goes from $0000 to SOOFF (0 to 255), page one 
from $0100 to SOIFF, and so forth through page 255, which consists of 
locations $FFOO through $FFFF (65280 through 65535). You won't 
always see addresses as four-digit numbers; leading zeros may be left off. 
Such page organization is helpful to the Apple's designers and program- 
mers, who can reserve whole pages of memory for special purposes and 
easily remember what goes where by the page reserved for it. 

Most of the programs that go into memory, whether in Basic or ma- 
chine language, occupy much bigger chunks than a page and are more 
often referred to by their absolute address or size. Pages zero through 
three, which we'll discuss later, are the only pages of this kind that are re- 
served by the Apple itself for a distinct purpose. The word page is used 
more commonly to refer to the areas of memory reserved for the text and 
graphics displays. Each of these pages is actually much longer than the 
256-byte kind of page. We'll talk about these later also. 

Plunging In. Now to begin our expedition. Use the memory map on 
page 69 of your Apple II Reference Manual as a guide to the locations 
mentioned in the rest of the article. Note that address numbers and page 
numbers can be spxjken of in decimal or hexadecimal, so the map has the 
hex addresses on the left and the decimal ones on the right. 

The top sixty-four pages, locations 49152 through 65535 
($C000— $FFFF), are taken up by the ROM chips that contain Apple- 
soft and the Monitor. Any memory below that, from location zero 
through 49151 ($BFFF), is RAM memory and can be changed by the 
user or running programs. 

Immediately below Applesoft is an area of memory used by periph- 
eral cards, the game controllers, the speaker, and a few other things, for 
input and output. Beneath that is the memory used by the disk operat- 
ing system (DOS) if it has been loaded. 

When you boot the disk, DOS is loaded into locations 40192 through 
49151 ($9D00-$9CFF). DOS also needs to reserve locations 38400 
through 40191 ($9600-$9CFF) for buffers to store input and output 
data temporarily while the Apple waits for the disk to catch up with it. 
Although you can increase or decrease the size of these buffers, at this 
stage it's safe to assume that the default value will be used and that DOS 
will not need any memory below 38400 ($9600). 

From the Bottom Up. Now let's jump down to location zero and 
work our way back up to where we are now. 

The first three pages of memory, zero through two, are used exten- 
sively by Applesoft, DOS, and the Monitor. You shouldn't plan to store 
anything in these locations because altering the contents of some of them 
can cause drastic errors. 

The first memory page, often called zero page, has a special signif- 
icance to the 6502 microprocessor. There are some forms of machine lan- 
guage addressing that require the use of one or two zero-page locations. 
Therefore, zero-page locations are used primarily as pointers by Apple- 
soft, DOS, the Monitor, and other machine language programs. A 
pointer, by the way, is a place in memory that a machine language pro- 
gram can read to find the address in memory of a particular table or 
subroutine. 

Page one, the second page, is another special-purpose area called the 
system stack. A stack is an area of memory that works like a pile of data. 



256 



S O [ T A L l< 



MARCH 1983 



When you put some data on the pile, you put it on top. When you take it 
off the pile, you take it off the top. Picture a stack of dishes. The last dish 
you put on the stack will be the first one you take off of it. This is called a 
last-in-first-out, or LIFO, method of storing data. When a Basic pro- 
gram executes a gosub statement or for-next loop, the return address is 
put on the stack for easy retrieval later on. 

Page two is called the input buffer. When you type in a Basic pro- 
gram line or answer a question the computer asks, what you type is 
stored temporarily in the input buffer before being processed. 

Although substantial parts of these three pages may be unused at any 
given moment, you never know which they are and whether or not 
they're going to be needed in the next moment. It's best to leave every- 
thing below page three alone. 

After the initial boot, most of page three is available for storing the 
user's machine language programs. Of the 256 bytes on the page, the first 
208 (768-975 or $300-$30F) bytes are free. This is a favorite place for 
commercial packages to load short machine language programs. Here 
they're safe from the Apple's automatic internal operations. The last 
forty-eight bytes on this page (976- 1023 or $3D0— $3FF) are needed for 
certain operations of both DOS and Applesoft. 

Turning the Page. Locations 1024 through 2047 ($400-$7FF) just 
above page three contain the information the screen needs to print either 
text or lo-res graphics. This is called the text page, even though it is four 
pages (of the 256-byte variety) long. If you haven't added an eighty-col- 
umn board to your machine, your screen can display forty characters per 
line and twenty-four lines of text, for a total of 960 characters. If you 
divide this total by 256, you'll see that only three and three-quarters 
pages of memory are needed in order to give each screen position its own 
byte. Whatever peripheral devices you have use the remaining sixty- 
four bytes as temporary storage locations; these bytes should not be con- 
sidered available either. 

To see how the text display works, enter and run the following 
program: 
10 HOME 

20 FOR I = 1024 TO 2047 
30 POKE I, 65 
40 NEXT I 

As stated on page 139 of your Applesoft manual, the number 65 is the 
ASCII code for the letter A. When you run the program, your screen 
should fill with As. They'll be flashing because, in the screen memory, the 
number 65 is displayed as a flashing A; the number 193 is displayed as a 
normal A. When you're in text mode, each character loca- 
tion on the screen corresponds to its own memory location and displays 
whatever is in that location. 

Lo-res graphics mode uses the same memory locations as text mode, 
and each byte corresponds to the same screen location. The display, 
however, is different. Each of the 960 bytes of text screen memory 
controls two dots, one on top of the other, resulting in 1,920 rectangular 
lo-res dots on the screen. 

A byte can be divided into two four-bit halves, called nibbles. Each 
nibble contains a value of from 0 to 15 and controls the color of one dot 
on the lo-res screen. In binary notation, the possible values of a nibble 
range from 0000 to 1111. 

Lo-res graphics mode allows sixteen different colors. To demon- 
strate this, type in the following short program: 

10 OR 

20 FOR I = 1024 TO 2047 
30 N = N + 1 

40 IF N > 255 THEN N = 0 
50 POKE I, N 
60 NEXT I 

If you're using a color monitor, you should see lines and dots in dif- 
ferent colors plus four lines of text at the bottom when you run this pro- 
gram. If your display is black and white, the pattern will differ. 

Beneath the Pretty Pictures. If you were to enter the Monitor now 
and examine the appropriate memory locations, you'd find the hex values 
corresponding to the colors your program produced. For example, 1 is 
Applesoft's lo-res color code for magenta. The eight-bit binary repre- 
sentation for 1 is 00000001 . Since the first four bits are zero, the upper of 
the two lo-res dots is black and the lower takes the color that is coded 



0001; this is magenta. To see this, change line 30 to = / and you 
should see your screen fill with alternating magenta and black lines. Now 
run it again with A' = 77 in line 30. The binary number for 17 is 
00010001, which turns on magenta in both dots. 

Before moving on, try using 255 for N. Since 255 is the largest num- 
ber one byte can hold, the binary representation of it is 11111111. Both 
nibbles now contain their maximum values (1111 binary or 16 decimal) 
and instruct the screen to display the associated color, which is white. 
Binary 0000 for one nibble is black, which produces what we think of as 
an empty dot, while binary 1111 (16 or $F) produces the opposite color, 
which is white. In between are the other fourteen lo-res colors. If you'd 
like to see them and their associated numbers, boot your system master 
and run Color Demosoft. 

Immediately above the text /lo-res memory area (2048 or $800) is 
where Applesoft Basic programs begin. To see this, first enter the fol- 
lowing one-line program. 



NEW 

10 PRINT 



■AAAAA" 



Now type call —151 to enter the Monitor. When you see the asterisk 
prompt, type 800.80F to list locations $800 to $80F (2048 - 2063). This is 
what you should see on your screen: 

0800- 00 OE 08 OA 00 BA 22 41 
0808- 41 41 41 41 22 00 00 00 

That's what a Basic program looks like in hex code. Hex $0A is equiva- 
lent to decimal 10, your line number. Hex $BA is the code correspond- 
ing to the print command. ASCII codes $22 and $41 are the quotation 
mark and letter A, respectively. The zeros at the end indicate the end of 
a line. 

It's possible to write Basic programs that take up all the space from 
$800 to the bottom of DOS. If you plan to use hi-res displays, however, 
you'll probably need to keep the program below location 8192 ($2000), 
where page one of hi-res graphics begins. 

Getting Really Graphic. There are two hi-res graphics pages. As with 
the text /lo-res page, we're not talking about 256-byte-long memory pages 
but about two areas of memory, each consisting of 8,192 bytes. Just as 
lo-res graphics uses one nibble to control one screen dot, so hi-res 
graphics has a one-to-one correspondence between specific memory loca- 
tions and specific screen locations. In this case the relationship is one bit 
per dot, and the dots are much smaller. Although the hi-res screen is 
more complicated than this description may imply, you can think of it as 
being 280 dots wide by 160 high, resulting in a total of 53,200 dots. Since 
one bit per byte is reserved for a color code, each byte controls seven 
dots. Thus 7,600 memory locations (53,200 divided by 7) are needed for 
hi-res display, but 8,192 are actually set aside for each hi-res page. Hi-res 
page one then uses memory locations 8192 through 16383 ($2000-$3999), 
while graphics page two occupies locations 16384 through 24575 
($4000-$5999). 

Just as we could poke numbers into specific memory locations to con- 
trol the lo-res display, so can we poke numbers into hi-res graphics to ac- 
complish the same thing. We can get some idea of what's happening by 
running the following program: 

10 HGR 

20 FOR I = 8192 TO 16383 
30 POKE I, 255 
40 NEXT I 

This program sets all bits in all the bytes to 1 (or on), which means that 
all the dots on the screen will go on and the whole screen will display 
white. 

As we saw in January, the usual place to put machine language pro- 
grams is between the end of hi-res page two and the beginning of DOS. 

At this point in your Apple-using career this ought to be enough 
about memory. Later, when you need a truly detailed Apple atlas that 
covers every byte of memory, you might want to look at the book What's 
Where in the Apple, by William F. Luebbert, published by Micro Ink 
(Chelmsford, MA). Be sure to get the revised edition. 

Another class of beginners moves on. April's Beginners' Comer begins at the begin- 
ning with the lie: Matt Yuen takes over the writer's block. Chris Light will continue 
intermediate-level stuff from time to time in Ilnd Grade Chats.

For those who need even more power, a more advanced ver- 
sion combines all the above features with the ability to use 
many of the memory expansion boards currently available. A 
configuration editor allows VisiCalc to use a mixture of dif- 
ferent kinds of memory expansion cards. Just tell it what 
memory cards you have and which slots they are in. For exam- 
ple, you could use more than one language card equivalent. The 
memory cards can be combined 
to give you access up to 
1 76 K of memory!

VENTURES WITH 
VISICALC 

BV lOE \HELTOH 



Last month's Softalk contained an article about how VisiCalc Ad- 
vanced Version was used to calculate the statistics of an Apple Comput- 
er-sponsored tennis match between Jimmy Connors and Bjorn Borg. We 
are now going to build the VisiCalc template that was used at that match. 
Then we'll look at how we can use the same type of model to do a more 
complete analysis of a tennis player's game. 

Tennis, Anyone? A simple explanation of the relevant parts of the 
game would probably make this discussion more meaningful to those of 
you who haven't played tennis. Scoring a tennis match requires keeping 
track of points, games, and sets. Each player's goal is to win enough 
points to win a game, enough games to win a set, and finally, enough sets 
to win the match. 

A point is won by one of the two players (or by a team in doubles) 
each time the tennis ball is put in play. When the game is scored the usual 
way, a minimum of four points must be scored in each game. The win- 
ner must win at least four points and must win by a margin of two 
points. This means that a game could, theoretically at least, have an un- 
limited number of points if the players won points alternately. 

Games usually average between four and ten points total. The first 
player to win six games with a two-game margin wins the set. If it should 
happen that both players win six games, there are two options. Play can 
continue until one player has a two-game lead or a tie-breaker can be 
played. Normally the winner is the player who wins two sets out of three, 
although in some major championships the winner must triumph in 
three sets out of five. 

Various rules determine how points are won (or lost) in tennis, but 
for our purposes only three situations need to be discussed. One way a 
player can win a point is by hitting the ball somewhere in the opposite 
court so that the other player can't reach it. This is referred to as a "win- 
ner." Another way of winning a point is by hitting the ball so well that 
the other player can reach the ball but can't return it into play. This is re- 
ferred to as a "forced error." When one player is in a good position to hit 
the ball and misses, hitting the ball out of the court or into the net, his 
opponent wins a point. This is the third — and incidentally the most com- 
mon — way a point is won. 

To be able to analyze a match using VisiCalc, that is all we really 
need to know. The statistics usually calculated for tennis matches (and 
used by those doing the commentary) are shown in figure 1. Don't wor- 
ry if you don't understand all of them; the principles underlying them 
will quickly become apparent. 



First-service percentage— A server gets two chances to put a ball in play or 
the server loses the point. This statistic is the percentage of times a player 
gets the first ball in play. 

Aces— This is a service winner where the opponent doesn't touch the ball. 

Double faults— A player who misses both serves loses the point and is said 
to have double faulted. 

Forehand and backhand winners — Points won when a player hits a ground 
stroke the opponent can't touch. 

Forehand and backhand unforced errors— Points lost when a player can 
reasonably be expected to keep the ball in play with a groundstroke but 
doesn't. 

Trips to net and won at net— A player may approach the net and hope to 
win the point quickly. It's important to know how many points are won at net 
versus how many are attempted. 

Figure 1. 



Our next step is to begin creating the model. Boot VisiCalc and let's 
get started. Refer to figure 2 and enter the labels as shown there. Leave 
rows 1 through 3 blank; we'll be entering additional information into 
them later. Set the column widths to 5 (/GC5 or whatever is appropriate 
for your display) to permit more of the model to be visible. 

If you're using VisiCalc Advanced Version, you can set the width of 
column A (/GCC14) so that all the title text can fit in the same column. 
Continue entering the rest of the information into the cells, with cell ref- 
erences matching those shown here so you won't have to adjust your 
model until after it's completed. Then delete the blank columns B and C.

Figure 2. 





How Do We Score? Let's think for a moment about what we are try- 
ing to accomplish. Take forehand groundstrokes for example. As you 
can see from figure 2, we've divided forehands into winners and un- 
forced errors. That means we are going to ignore forced errors. If we 
wished, we could simply enter a value in E9 or ElO and increment it each 
time we saw another winner or error. That would be easy, but in the heat 
of the match we might accidentally enter the wrong value and then for- 
get the original value. There must be a safer way. And there is. (Sur- 
prised?) 

If we use columns at the bottom of the model for scoring, we can 
make an individual entry for each point by entering points consecutively 
down the column. Working in that manner means that at the very most 
we'll change only one value and won't have to remember the running to- 
tal. Now, it's simple; each statistic can have a separate column and we 
only have to enter a value in the appropriate column. But can things be 
made still simpler? Yes. 

Look again at our forehand statistics. We are looking only for win- 
ners and unforced errors. We can have one column for forehands and en- 
ter one value if the player hits a winner and a different value if he makes 
an unforced error. But now things get complicated again. We have to be 
able to tell the two values apart. How can we tell the difference between 
them? If we enter a 1 for a winner, we can ©SUM the column and deter- 
mine the number of winners. If we enter a 2 or some other value for un- 
forced errors, our sum won't be accurate anymore. However, if we enter 
a 0 for unforced errors, the ©SUM of winners will be correct. Now we 
total unforced errors. There is no function to sum Os. Before reading 
further, look at your reference card or your manual and see if you can 
find a solution. 

There is a way to enter Os and Is in a column and count each value 
independently, as well as to count both if we wish. This, by the way , is an 
important idea that can be applied to other areas besides sports scoring. 
The functions ©SUM and ©COUNT can do it all. 



260 



SOFTAI 1^ 



MARCH 1983 



We know what ©SUM will do; it will total all the Is that we enter in 
the column. ©COUNT will, according to the reference card, count the 
"number of nonblank entries in list." That isn't exartly true; ©COUNT 
only counts values. If you enter text in the list, ©COUNT ignores it. In 
our application, this means that ©COUNT counts the number of Is and 
Os. Now getting the number of Os is a simple matter of subtracting 
©SUM from ©COUNT. 

There's another facet of ©COUNT and ©SUM worth discussing. 
We can actually track a third value if we want to. Both ©COUNT and 
©SUMrequire a list of values or cell references to complete the formula. 
We'll use a range that starts at our first game point and continues for a 
sfjecified number of rows. 

The third value we can track is the number of cells in our range. This 
could be the maximum number of entries and could be used in calculat- 
ing another statistic. We can determine this value by manually counting 
all the cells in the range or we can enter 1 in A21 and +A21-I- 1 in A22, 
replicating those two cells for the same number of rows using relative ref- 
erence. It's a simple matter to use ©MAX on that column fo determine 
the total number of cells used. ©MAX displays the final (largest) value. 
Thus we know the total number of possible values, the number of Is, and 
the number of Os. This isn't appropriate for our model, but it might be 
useful for other analysis. 

In our column, we can now enter Is for winners and Os for unforced 
errors, and we can keep a running total. Figure 3 shows our model with 
the scoring section complete.

You'll notice that we have used a window (/WH) to separate the sta- 
tistical area from the scoring section. If you don't have an eighty-column 
display, you should synchronize the windows (/WS) so that when you 
scroll the entry and statistics sections wall remain together. We have also 
set a horizontal title (/TH) in row 19. This setup allows us to continue 
entering points down the column. The titled area lets us see the column 
headings while we're making entries. 

If you haven't done so already, enter the additional information dis- 
played in figure 3 into your model now. Enter 1 in A21 and + H-A21 in 
A22, replicating those two cells through A40 using relative reference. If 
you were analyzing an actual match, you'd replicate through A150 to 
provide enough cells to contain points for a complete set. At the end of 
each game enter a 1 in column A in the row on which the next game will 
begin. Later you'U be able to scroll down the model and see how many 
points were played in each game. You could also do an ©MAX, limit- 
ing the range to just that used in the set, to determine the number of 
points played in a single game. 

Another important thing to remember is that the ranges specified in 
our functions will determine how long it takes a model to recalculate. If 
ail the ranges are only ten rows, the model wiU complete a recalculation 
about thirty seconds faster than if the ranges had been two hundred 
rows. As always, VisiCalc pays dividends if you are as simple and pre- 
cise as possible. 



It's also a good idea to set the recalculation mode to manual 
(/GRM), especially when you have normal ranges. This will enable you 
to enter formulas and to score during a match without having to wait for 
a recalculation after each point. Apple III owners can speed up the re- 
calculation by "turning the lights out." Pressing control-5 will blank out 
the screen display during the recalculation, speeding up recalculation 
time by about 25 percent. 

Two points require additional comment. First, we usually complete 
statistics for two players, so you'll want to complete a duplicate section 
starting further to the right in your model (for example, beginning at col- 
umn K). Second, it's interesting to note that now we require only six col- 
umns to complete the ten statistics for one player. 

Service Statistics. We'll complete our model by taking all of the sta- 
tistics and filling in their formulas in column E. The first three statistics 
relate to serving (first-serve percent, aces, and double faults) and involve 
entries in the first three columns (columns B, C, and D) in the scoring 
section. 

Every time a player aces his opponent, enter a 1 in the appropriate 
player's aces column (for example, in column B for player one). Move to 
the top window (;) and go to cell E6. Total the aces using 
©SUM(B21. . .B40). Normally, you'd change the range to something 
approximating B21. . .B150. As mentioned earlier, we want to keep the 
recalculation time short during model development. 

First serve and second serve are the next columns. Where aces con- 
stitute only a sum, first serve uses Is and Os in the manner we talked 
about earlier. If a player gets his first serve in play, enter a 1 in column C; 
if he faults (misses), enter a 0. Note that serves will be treated slightly 
differently than the remaining statistics; a 1 doesn't mean that the player 
won the point, only that he succeeded in putting his serve in play. By the 
same token, a 0 doesn't mean that the player lost (on the first serve), on- 
ly that he missed the serve. This statistic will require our model to reflect 
an understanding of the difference between 1 and 0. 

Go to E5. The first-serve percent is a measure of how many times a 
player gets his first serve into play divided by how many times the player 
attempts a first serve. Keeping in mind our solution, we would enter the 
following in cell E5: 

@SUM(C21, . .C40)/@COUNT(C21. . .C40) 

If a player aces his opponent, enter a 1 in column B and a 1 in col- 
umn C. If the player misses the first serve, enter only a 0 in column C. 
Doing things this way requires making two entries for an ace. We can 
simplify this. 

If a player aces his opponent, that is also the equivalent of getting a 
first serve in play (albeit not for long). So aces should be included in our 
first-serve percent. We can accomplish this by doing a separate percent 
for column B, but it's easier to set things up in our original percentage 
formula. All we have to do is include the ©SUM and ©COUNT for col- 
umn B. The formula in E5 should now look like this: 

@SUM(B21. . .B40,C21. . .C40)/@COUNT 
(B21. . .B40,C21. . .C40) 

Now an ace entered in column B will automatically count as a first serve 
in play. No additional entry will be required in column C. (By the way, 
the two ranges in each pair of parentheses are treated as a single list of 
values.) 

Double faults are calculated by entries made in the second-serve col- 
umn (column D). If we wanted to, we could simply enter 0 for each sec- 
ond-serve fault (a double fault because the first serve was already a fault). 
But it would be nice not to have a different set of rules for the two differ- 
ent service columns. To be consistent, enter a 1 for a serve in play and a 0 
for a fault in both columns C and D. The formula in E7 will calculate 
only the number of Os, however. The formula in E7 is: 

@C0UNT(D21. . .D40)-@SUM(D21. . .D40) 

Forehand and Backhand Statistics. The forehand and backhand sta- 
tistics are calculated in the same way. The only difference is that the for- 
mulas reference different columns. Because of the similarity between the 
forehand and backhand statistics, we'll discuss only the forehand. 

Forehands are divided into winners and unforced errors. Remem- 
ber, we've decided to forego calculating forced errors. We'll make all en-

tries for forehands in column E. The scoring is simple. If a player hits the 
ball inside the court that the other player can't reach, enter a 1; if the ball 
is hit into the net or out of the court, enter a 0. The formula for comput- 
ing winners (in E9) is: 

@SUM(E21. . .E40) 

The formula for computing unforced errors requires counting the to- 
tal number of entries and subtracting the winners. The formula in £10 is: 

@C0UNT(E21. . .E40)-@SUM(E21, . .E40) 

The backhand formulas are the same, except that column F is used 
for scoring. The backhand formulas are: 



Winner (E12): @SUM(F21. . .F40) 
Unforced Errors (El 3): @C0UNT(F21. 
-@SUM(F21, . .F40)

Points at Net Statistics. This series of statistics may seem slightly 
more complex than the ones we've been dealing with up until now, but 
it's not really. The same mathematical formulas are used. The complex 
part is trying to understand what we are attempting to accomplish. Ex- 
perienced tennis players and watchers won't have difficulty; for those 
who don't fit either of those categories, a little explanation might be 
helpful. 

In the course of playing a point, one of the players might choose to 
approach the net and try to end the point with a quick volley winner (hit- 
ting the ball before it touches the ground). The winning or losing of a 
match can depend on how successful this strategy is. Some players, such 
as John McEnroe, rarely hit a lot of groundstrokes; they choose instead 
to attack at the first opportunity and attempt to win at the net. Others, 
such as Bjom Borg, are content to hit groundstrokes. But even Borg re- 
alizes how important the net is and has changed his game to include go- 
ing to the net occasionally. 

You'll notice that we have only one column for three statistics (trips 
to net, won at net, and percent won at net). In fact, these statistics are just 
as simple as the others we've been dealing with. When a player ap- 
proaches the net, enter a 1 if he wins the point and a 0 if he loses it. Using 
©COUNT, we can determine the number of times the player attempted 
to come to the net (the total number of Is and Os); ©SUM will then tell 
us how successful the player was. In E14, enter: 

@C0UNT(G21. . .G40) 

And in El 5, enter: 

@SUM(G21. . .040) 

The percentage won at net is calculated by entering the following 
into El 6: 

+ E15/E14 

Now the basic statistics are complete. Of course, we've neglected the 
statistics for sets 2 and 3, as well as the match statistics. The simplest 
method of handling sets 2 and 3 is by entering additional scoring titles in 
row 20. In the author's model, for example, the second set of player-one 
aces (remember, there are two players in each set) begins in column R, 
the third set in column AH. 

After each set has been completed, simply scroll the bottom window 
across to the new section and begin entering. The statistics for these sets 
should be completed in the same way as they were in set 1, but with dif- 
ferent ranges. An easy way to accomplish this is to replicate all the for- 
mulas across (with no change) and then to edit for the new columns (the 
rows will stay the same). 

Figure 4 gives the formulas used in the author's model. 

One final note on scoring. If you're already a bit confused as to what 
to enter in the scoring column, you'll be relieved to see that we've left an 
empty row (row 20) for comments. The author's has the reminder "En- 
ter 1 for ace, nothing else" in cell B20. It won't matter that you can't see 
the complete message in the model. Move the cursor to the cell and read 
the message on the edit line. If the message bleeds off the screen, use the 
edit (/E) command and the arrow keys to scroll so you can see the com- 
plete text. If your version of VisiCalc doesn't have editing ability, be care-

ful to make the complete text visible in the window. (You might also con- 
sider purchasing the new version of VisiCalc; it has many features that 
make it more powerful than the original version. ) 

Match Totals. The remaining column completes the match statis- 
tics. It will keep a running average of the totals. Thus you'll be able to see 
how each player is faring overall, as well as how he's doing in each indi- 
vidual set. It's an interesting comparison because a player's consistency 
often changes during a match. 

Most of the formulas in column H are straightforward summations 
of columns E, F, and G in the same row. For example, in H6,l the total 
number of aces is either E6-I-F6+G6 or @SUM(E6. . .G6). Replicate 
that formula (with relative reference) into H7, H9, HIO, and HI 2 
through HI 5. 

The formulas in H5 and Hi 6 are different. You can't sum a series of 
percentages and divide by the number of percentage values and get the 
correct answer. So we have a dilemma. We want to keep it simple. The 
answer for H16 is to use the values we already have. In cell HI 6, enter: 

-I-H15/H14 

The answer for H5 is more complicated. The method that would take 



up the least number of cells would be to enter the ©SUM of all the aces 
and first-serve columns and divide by the ©COUNTs of the same col- 
umns. The problem with that option is that VisiCalc limits the number of 
characters in a cell to 125. Incidentally, VisiCalc allows nine levels of 
nesting, in case you're inclined to try such complex methods of saving 
space. 

So, for once we bite the bullet and use additional cells (why do you 
think we left rows 1 and 2 open?). Of course, we don't have to place the 
formulas in rows 1 and 2. We could place them anywhere. Stop and see if 
you can determine why rows 1 and 2 are better than, for example, rows 
21 and 22. 

Why this is so has to do with the recalculation order in VisiCalc. The 
recalculation order was explained in this column just a few months ago; 
so we won't discuss it in depth now. However, it's always good to keep in 
mind. VisiCalc starts scanning from cell Al and either goes down the col- 
umns or across the rows, depending upon the recalculation order. If we 
placed our ©SUM and ©COUNT in rows 21 and 22, row 5 would see 
values in rows 21 and 22 and use them for its calculations. Then, when 
VisiCalc recalculated rows 21 and 22, it would update them to the cor- 
rect values. The values represented in row 5 would be incorrect until the

next recalculation. Thus, to ensure accuracy, two calculations would al- 
ways be required. 

If our sums are above row 5, then they are recalculated before row 5 
and always provide accurate values. The formulas for rows 1 and 2 in the 
author's model are shown in figure 5.

Figure 5. 

The formula for cell H5 is: 

(E1-hF1-hG1)/(E2-FF2-l-G2) 

One last thing. Since our model is row-oriented, change the recalcu- 
lation order to rows (/GOR). Now we're finished. 

There are a number of personalizations of the model that you might 
want to try making. You can go back to cells E5, F5, and G5 and divide 
row I by row 2 if you want. You can also calculate a number of other 
statistics, but we'll get to that later. 

You'll notice that some of the cells display ERROR. That refers to a 
division by 0 error. Using the information provided in a prior column, 
you could make these cells display 0 until you entered a value into them. 
Hint: doing this involves using ©IF. VisiCalc Advanced Version users can 
employ the ©LABEL function as the else value. But that's another 
column. . . . 

Score Yourself. Scoring other people's matches can teach you a lot 
about tennis and other sports. You might also wonder how you can use 
this model to help improve your own game. One way would be to ask a 
friend to use this model to chart your game. You don't have to take the 
computer out onto the court, either. Have a paper filled out with the six 
columns and the person doing your scoring can enter Is and Os on the 
paper as if it were the VisiCalc model on the computer. Afterward, you 
can enter the results yourself and see how the same comparisons used on 
the pros apply to your own game. 

Another option, and a much more revealing one, is to design a dif- 
ferent model to chart your strokes and give you more insight into your 
own game. The model itself is straightforward, using the principles 
you've already learned. The difference is that every normal stroke is 
scored. Figure 6 shows the completed template.

You'll notice many similarities to the first model. The screen is still 
divided into two windows: a statistical window and a scoring window. 
The points are still numbered in column A, enabling you to tell how 
many points were played per game. 

The differences aren't extreme. There are now seven columns for 
scoring. You'll have to set the cell widths narrower to display all eight 
columns (including column A). The statistics are only won, error, and 
percent won. Won uses ©SUM, error is @COUNT-@SUM, and per- 
cent won is ©SUM/@COUNT. You should be able to figure out how to 
make the model work by now. Good luck.

STORY-TALK 



F I C T I ON 




6^ DAVID HUNTER 



Quaking, rustling from an unseen, unfelt breeze, a branch of the 
quiverleaf tree cast a shimmering, dancing shadow on the one hundred 
second and one hundred third pages of War and Peace (Simon and 
Schuster, The Inner Sanctum Edition, 1942). The 1,370-page novel, plus 
62 pages of introductory material, was comfortably propped in the lap of 
Vladimir Kozintsev. 

Wrinkled, slightly yellowed, a steady index finger pulled at the up- 
per-right-hand corner of page 103 and flipped it up and over. The old 
prince, Nicholas Andreevich Bolkonski, is using Michael Ivanovich to il- 
lustrate the theory that all men are equals. Sunstruck, very much alive in 
the new spring, the quiverleaf touched the old man and his old book with 
its shadow. Swimming fractals collided and interfaced with the straight 
and orderly words of Tolstoy in a random underwaterlike ballet. 

Kozintsev first saw the girl when she was standing next to the trem- 
bling quiverleaf, with the sun behind her. He looked straight at her, 
through his one-hundred-thirty-one-year-old eyes. So tall, so thin. Must 
have been raised in zero gravity. 

Long black hair twirling like an olive branch in a storm, the girl 
turned her back on Kozintsev and commenced to look about. She acted 
nervous and very unfriendly. 

"Please don't go. Stay." Kozintsev's voice was steady and not 
threatening. 

The girl clapped small white hands to her ears and made a long, loud, 
full-throated wind-call. Kozintsev closed the book and put it down. 
What an inhuman sound. 

As if on cue, a slight breeze came rustling through the woods. The 
girl turned and her eyes were bright with water. 

"Come here." Vladimir stood up and gave her his best post one 
hundred grin. She walked forward slowly. 

She carried only one small pack and a walking stick. She was wear- 
ing shorts, knee-high mountain boots, and a bright green sweater. Koz- 
intsev guessed her age to be around sixteen. She stood a full six foot six 
inches but was almost unhealthily thin. She was not well muscled or par- 
ticularly tan. She seemed oddly older than she looked, and yet she had a 
certain innocence and mystery. 

"My name is Vladimir Kozintsev. What is yours?" 

The girl put her hands on her ears again and gave him an unhappy 
look. 

Maybe she doesn't speak English. 

The girl stamped her stick twice on the ground and made a sound 
very much like a loud yawn. 

Kozintsev leaned on the waist-high rail of his front porch and peered 
at the girl standing only fifteen feet away. She looked back with a very 
blank expression that Kozintsev strangely felt said more than a book the 
size of War and Peace. Natasha! No. There is something wrong about her. 

"Look," he said, brandishing his right index fmger, pointing toward 
the quiverleaf. "I'm Vladimir," the finger touched his chest. "You are 
. . ." the finger pointed at the giri. 

"Dorothy!" She said it loud, but perfectly. 

/ wonder what happened to her brain-mate. Maybe it malfunctioned. 
Dorothy is an odd name. Never met a Dorothy. 
"Where do you come from, Dorothy?" 
She pointed behind her at the forest line. 
"Do you speak another language?" 
A blank, powerful look. 

"Blaademirrour," she blurted. She pointed at the quaking quiver- 
leaf. 



"That tree is called a quiverieaf. It's the American Aspen." 
Dorothy saatched her head and stamped her stick. She sang a short, 
merry verse of monosyllabic nonsense. 
"Queverrdeef," she said. 

Kozintsev walked over to the top of the stair that led from the porch 
to the ground. His great-great-grandfather had built a beautifully rug- 
ged cabin, perfect for the chilly winters and balmy summers of central 
Appala-Penn. Dorothy stepped lithely up the handmade stairs. 

"Goodsdaya," she said cheerfully when she reached the porch. 
"Blaademirrour." 

"Actually that's Vladimir. I think you should meet Andromeda; she 
lives here too. She's inside making dinner. Would you like to come in?" 

"Gaaah . . ." Dorothy shook her head up and around and pointed at 
the door. 

She smells the food. 

"Andromeda! We have a visitor." Kozintsev shambled on in with 
Dorothy following. His six-foot frame fit in handsomely with the homey, 
wood paneled interior of the cabin. 

"Waaiouts." Dorothy pointed at War and Peace in Kozintsev's right 
hand. 

"This is a book." She's either had a terrible shock or she is illiterate, or 
both. It's almost English she's speaking. Almost. It could be a case of 
apraxia — a disorder late in the neurological chain of command. She may be 
making perfect sense in her own mind. 

"Buuk." Dorothy was looking everywhere at everything. Smiling, she 
ran over and touched a lit-up phosphor screen. 

"That is a data window to an info-slate." 

Andromeda Houston came through a door behind Dorothy. Life- 
long friend of Kozintsev, Andromeda searched him now with her one- 
hundred-twenty-nine-year-old eyes. 

"Dorothy this is Andromeda. Andromeda this is Dorothy. She just 
walked out of the woods and I'll bet she's half-starved." Kozintsev 
winked at Andromeda, who nodded her head. 

"There's plenty for the three of us. Here child, put down your things 
and come sit by the fire. The spring air is still chilly, especially in the deep 
forest." Dorothy silently let herself be led to a plush armchair. 

Vladimir and Andromeda went to the cookery and had a quiet talk 
while they prepared salads and a creamy vegetable casserole. 

"She just walked out of the forest?" Andromeda asked. 

Vladimir took apart a head of lettuce, leaf by leaf, layer by layer. 

"I can't figure her out. She seems to understand certain words, but 
she's unable to handle sentences." 

Andromeda chopped a carrot. "I wonder what happened to her 
brain-mate." 

"Either it malfunctioned, or. . . ." 

"Or?" 

Kozintsev stared mysteriously at the lobotomized head of lettuce. 
"Or, she doesn't have one." 

"But that's incredible. Everybody born on Earth in the last two hun- 
dred some-odd years has had one implanted a year after birth. It's stan- 
dard equipment these days." 

"By her appearance, I'd say she was born and raised in space." 

Andromeda dished a heaping portion of steaming vegetables into a 
pewter porringer. "Dimi, do you think she's dangerous? It's a long ways 
between us and the authorities." 

"She seems harmless to me. Very much confused and uncertain, but 
no threat. She might be suffering from amnesia or some form of apha-

sia. Her first reaction on seeing me was to run away. Fascinating." 

Andromeda waiiced over to Vladimir and put her arms around him. 
"You old Russian bastard, pretending you're Tolstoy, eh? Wise old man, 
indeed. I love you, even after half an eternity." She kissed him on his 
whiskery cheek. 

"Has it been that long?" 

Andromeda took two dishes of food into the living area and was 
gone for a minute or two as Kozintsev made the hot herbal tea. There is 
something raw about Dorothy, unfinished. Kozintsev's thoughts were in- 
terrupted when he heard Andromeda talking to Dorothy in the other 
room. 

In a moment, Andromeda returned to the cookery. 

"Does she know about the collection?" she asked. "She seems fasci- 
nated by that old Encyclopaedia Britannica set. I found her breezing 
through one volume, looking at the pictures. I tried to tell her that the 
pictures are of a different Earth, back when it was fully populated. She 
just put her hands over her ears and made a whooshing sound." 

"I don't think she ever saw a book before today. That's not unusual, 
though. Do you realize it's been more than eighty years since they 
stopped printing." So many people now who don't know what a book or a 
magazine was. So many now who have never even seen Earth, who don't 
care. 

Vladimir and Andromeda brought in the tea and salads. Dorothy let 
the encyclopedia fall from her lap like it was nothing of value. Kozintsev 
winced. 

For a few moments no words were said among the three as all were 
busy relieving the most powerful hunger pains. Finally, Vladimir broke 
the moratorium. 

"Where are your parents, Dorothy? Do you have a mother and fa- 
ther?" He spoke slow and distinctly, hoping she would recognize some of 
the words and understand. 

"Fathertn mutherin spaysht. Fathertn gonna nowww." Dorothy 
made a windlike sound. "Mutherin hopshpital gonna nowww auhhh 



Dorothy yaaah whoosh zoolkooshwaaygo." 

Kozintsev put down his fork. Connect: did you get that? His info-file 
answered: yes, will keep saving. Vladimir looked at Andromeda, who al- 
so seemed to be conversing inwardly with her brain-mate. 

"Your father is dead. I'm sorry," he said to Dorothy, hoping he had 
understood her. 

"Dorothy derree nfathert." She looked sad and grew still. 

They ate again and Vladimir wondered what to ask Dorothy next. 
He was beginning to understand her a little. It was exaggerated English, 
he thought, and maybe some invented words. 

In all his years, Kozintsev had never met anyone like her. He had 
been all around known space, been all around the earth a dozen times. 
He and Andromeda still made trips to acquire rare books. Not so often 
anymore, it's true. Still, Kozintsev fancied himself a wise old man and he 
was mystified and intrigued by the wild young girl who apparently was 
without brain-mate and central info-file, who knew very little English or 
any other language, and who wandered the Appalachian Mountains 
alone, in this twenty-fifth century. 

He regarded her while she plowed into the lettuce, tomato, and car- 
rot salad. She knows how to handle a fork. Her eyes are quite intelligent, 
though dreamy, foresty. She also seems to take good care of herself. Her 
slimness is not as unhealthy-looking as I first thought. She isn't starving. 
Her bones and muscles can't support much weight. A legacy from space — 
which her body knows, if her mind doesn't. 

After dinner, the three had a long discussion. Andromeda pulled out 
a note pad and doodled with a pen. Dorothy was fascinated. 

"Here, you try it," said Andromeda. 

Dorothy gave happy chirping sounds as she made wide, sweeping 
marks on the pajjer. The two wise old humans were amused and 
touched. 

Later, Kozintsev asked questions and Dorothy answered in her 
strange, convoluted dialect. Andromeda took notes and eventually got 
tired around 11:00 p.m. She and Kozintsev made up a sleeping bag for

Dorothy and then Andromeda said goodnight. 

With the fire blazing and several candles lit, Kozintsev and Dorothy 
stayed up for a few more hours. The atmosphere in the cabin was magi- 
cal, with their shadows skipping haphazardly over the rows of books on 
elegant hardwood shelves. Kozintsev learned much about Dorothy and 
she became easier to understand. She learned fast. 

Through the course of the evening, Kozintsev pieced together her 
story as best he could. Dorothy was born and raised on an n-drive ship 
out of Europa. He inferred that her father and mother were stowaways 
and fugitives. Dorothy lived in space until she was five years old. When 
she was four, her mother was taken away to a hospital and never seen or 
heard from again. 

Dorothy's father fled to Earth and settled away from people, in the 
wilderness. He was very rich but had no imagination. They hved in a 
small cabin with no info-slate, not even a radio. Dorothy had never had a 
brain-mate installed. She was on her own. 

When she was six, Dorothy's father withdrew from the world; he 
ceased to talk and hardly moved at all. He sat silent in his chair and 
stared at a picture of Jupiter, year after year. 

They lived on the money her father had; Kozintsev believed that it 
was stolen. Dorothy would go into town three or four times a year and 
buy containerized supplies. Those trips were the only time she interacted 
with other humans who talked. She knew just enough Enghsh to get 
what she needed and would leave right away. 

For the previous ten years Dorothy had been alone, with no one to 
keep her fluent in the language. She wandered the forests, singing in her 
own sound-oriented tongue, talking to the trees in their own language, as 
best she could. 

The next morning, a sleepy Kozintsev and Andromeda sat on the 
front porch drinking coffee. Dorothy was still asleep in the spare room. 

"Her father finally snapped out of his silence three or four days ago," 
Kozintsev explained. "He started yelling and smashing things. Dorothy 
ran into the woods. She came back when she saw smoke. Her father had 
started a fire in the cabin and she found him sprawled outside. He was 
dead, probably from a heart attack." 

"Ah, the poor thing," said Andromeda. 

"She buried him, with great honor. He must have asked her to do 
that, before he stopped talking. He was a strange, powerful man from 
what I can gather. She marked the grave with his hat and boots. The 
shock probably has something to do with her speech problem, but its real 
genesis goes back ten years." 

Morning birds skimmed through the air and squirrels scampered 
about. Soft morning light shone through the trees and the quiverleaf. 

"She knows how to say her name perfectly because that is the one 
thing she remembers her mother saying. 

"Without a personal info-file she had no way to store and recall 
events and people perfectly, like we can. She saw data-windows and in- 
fo-slates during her childhood and on those trips to town. But she never 
really knew what they were for. She had never even seen books or pen 
and paper. She had her memories, of course, but they have faded with 
the passage of time." 

Kozintsev tugged thoughtfully on his beard. 

"I told her about our book collection and she got excited. She's as 
free as the wind, but I think she'd like to stay with us a while and learn to 
read, write, and speak properly." 

Andromeda set down her coffee cup. 

"That sounds like fun," she said. "Beats worrying about whether the 
robots have wandered into a bear's territory." 

"I told her she can sing to our trees all she wants. They'll listen and 
enjoy." Oh, how they'll listen. 

Kozintsev suddenly burst out laughing and dribbled coffee on his 
plaid shirt. 

"If there are more like her on this almost-empty, forgotten planet, 
we'll live longer than my father yet." 

Ten, twenty, thirty years more. It'll be worth it if there are more like 
Dorothy, who needs us. 

A slight wind rustled through the woods. The quiverleaf sang to its 
leather and cloth-bound cousins in Kozintsev's cabin. The trees gath- 
ered around and guarded the sacred treasury of knowledge. 3M

Softalk Presents Hie Bestsellers 



Making heads or tails out of the current Apple marketplace is no job 
for beginners. Things just keep getting stranger. And very little light was 
shed on the subject in the poll of January software sales. 

January turned out to be a disappointing month for most retailers. 
That should set off alarm bells all over the industry, because January is 
traditionally the second or third strongest month of the year. And this 
January should have been a blockbuster. 

January sales are usually strong because of the large number of new 
computer owners entering the market during the late December Christ- 
mas buying period. By the time their New Year's Day dinners have set- 
tled, they realize some of what they should have bought with their sys- 
tems and head back to their local retailers. This overlay of new users on 
the established base creates strong sales to kick off the year. 

That should have been especially true this year. Apple computers 
went flying out of the stores in unprecedented numbers in December, 
auguring a boom January. But it wasn't to be, and there's no hard evi- 
dence as to why this year didn't fit the pattern. 

Speculation that the imminent introduction of the lie depressed the 
market won't hold water. As those things go, it was a relatively well 
kept secret as to the exact day. Furthermore, any announcement about a 
new model should not have affected the buying habits of those who 
bought systems in December. 

Extrapolating from the number of computers sold in December, it 
figured that January would be the second biggest software month in his-

tory. It only got fifth or sixth. 

Fifth or sixth isn't all that bad, but the failure of the marketplace to 
perform as strongly as expected is not a publisher-friendly development. 

Quite possibly some of the weakness stems from a fragmentation of 
the delivery support system. That development is causing some confu- 
sion among retailers. Three years ago, it was difficult for dealers to keep 
up with the good software because of the lack of a well-focused delivery 
system. They were in the position of having to deal with each software 
publisher individually — a method that was time-consuming and 
inefficient. 

The advent of Softsel brought some order to the marketplace. They 
carried virtually every major software publisher and became an ex offi- 
cio one-stop shopping center for dealers. Keeping the best software on 
the shelves was as easy as calling Softsel. 

That's all changed. First, Softsel's success engendered the Softsel 
emulation mode, with new distributors entering the market on almost a 



weekly basis. Dealers now contend with almost as many distributors as 
they once did with publishers. Second, the collective body of distributors 
fell down on the job. 

The failure came from lack of recognition that most Apple dealers 
were adding at least one other computer brand to flesh out their line. 
When the distributors didn't move quickly into such areas as CP/M and 
IBM, the dealers were forced to go shopping for product — either by 
using several distributors or by returning to the method of dealing with

WORD PROCESSING 
HAS NEVER4BEEN SIMPLER 




Brederbund's Bank Street 
Writer turns your Apple or Atari computer into a powerful 
word processor, with many of the advanced features you'd 
expect to find only in an expensive business system. Powerful, 
yet purposefully simple, Bank Street Writer has no complex 
codes to memorize. The screen 
guides you every step of the 
way. It's everything you're ever 
likely to need in a word proces- 



sor at a price you can afford. 
Here are just a few of its many 
features: • Add, move, in- 
sert and erase blocks of text, 

♦ Universal search and replace, ♦ Automatic centering and 
indent, ♦ Automatic word wrap, so you don't have to hy- 
phenate or "return" at the end of each line, ♦ Potent print 
format routines all in memory, ♦ Disk storage and retrieve 



Bankstr^t 

Writer 



functions with password pro- 
tection, ♦ Document chaining allows you to print documents 
of unlimited length, ♦ Page headers and automatic page 
numbering— top or bottom, • Highlighting of text, • Upper 
and lowercase without additional hardware. 

Brederbund's Bank Street 
Writer comes complete with 
Tutorial and Utility programs, a 
comprehensive reference man- 



ual and a free back-up disk. 

Student approved, the en- 
tire system has been exten- 
sively tested by Bank Street 
College of Education and Intentional Educations. 

Bank Street Writer. The ground-breaking, sensible combi- 
nation of word processing power, thoughtful design, and 
exceptional value. 



The First Word Processor For The Entire Family.

Stepping into that breach was Micro Lab, with a program that pro- 
vided dealers with Micro Lab and Micro Fun software on consignment. 
No need to call; a salesperson visits the store to check the racks monthly 
and restocks as necessary. 

Industryites generally thought that Stan Goldberg, president of Mi- 
cro Lab, had gone off his rocker. The program was expensive to imple- 
ment and didn't appear to hold significant advantages over using dis- 
tributors. For the first six months, that conventional wisdom seemed to

hold true. 

Then came Miner 2049er. Miner is the first truly innovative package in 
some time from the Chicago software publisher. And it provided a good 
test of the flooring plan because approximately 50 percent of the stores 
were buying directly from Micro Lab and 50 percent were buying from 
distributors. 

Micro Lab aeamed the distributors. They've been outselling the en- 
tire body of distributors by a factor of at least five to one. Goldberg was 
crazy like a fox. 

Similar incidents of success outside the normal distributor channels 
are cropping up. State of the Art sells most of its product direct, and its 
General Ledger crept onto the bottom rung of the Top Thirty in January. 

Apple's got clout selling bread-and-butter software, but they've been 
truly underwhelming with their entertainment and more esoteric pack- 
ages. Lately, however, their educational offerings from Children's Tele- 
vision Workshop are clobbering the arcade games at the cash register. 



The Pizza Program 

Have you ever come home and wondered, "What are 
we having for dinner?" Now there's a great time saver 
for anyone who cooks or shops at the grocery store. 
Announcing the first dinner menu planning system. 



ENDS HO-HUM DINNERS 

Are you tired of the same old 
thing for dinner? Would you like 
more variety in your evening 
meal? Is there something you'd 
rather have but don't get very 
often? The Pizza Program is 
designed just for you. It's a de- 
lightful new software package 
designed to end the dinner-blahs 
with computer generated menus. 
Here is how it works. 

You review what you like from 
the pre-selected food groups in 
the system. Delete any foods 
you don't enjoy. Add anything 
new at any time. Then decide 
how often you like to eat certain 
items. For example Don't like 
liver? Then eliminate it with a few 
simple keystrokes. Or, you can 
plan for it as seldom as once every 
99 weeks or as often as daily. 

Want to go out to your favorite 
restaurant? Enter the restaurant's 
name as a "Main Course." Now 
your computer will automatically 
remind you to go out to eat— and 
as often as you select. It will de- 
lete all other items from that meal 
except the name of the restaurant. 

AUTOMATIC SHOPPING LIST 

You get a new menu each week 
or for just a few days if you want. 
And, it generates a detailed shop- 
ping list, automatically. It can 
arrange each item on the list in 
sequence according to the aisles 
at your favorite store. Studies 
show a shopping list will discour- 
age impulse buying and save 
you money. 

Also, it generates a per serving 
calorie counter. This is easy to 
delete anytime you are not in a 
diet mood or want to celebrate 
for any reason. You never count 
calories unless you want to. 

RANDOMLY DELICIOUS 

Say goodby to boring meals. 
Your computer will remember 
variety is the spice of life. This 
system makes eating at home a 
pleasure again. Each menu is 
randomly generated from major 
food groups according to the 
specific criteria you select. The 
system is easy to learn and easy 
to operate. Yet it is a sophisti- 
cated piece of software which will 
prevent menu mix-ups. 

The Pizza Program is not a 
recipe file. Instead, it is a com- 
plete menu planning system you 
customize to fit your tastes and 
budget. It's a practical and easy 
way to organize your meal plan- 
ning. You'll appreciate it day after 
day, week after week. People 



across the country are finding it 
a super idea— a great companion 
to any kitchen. 

TRY IT FOR 30 DAYS 
WITHOUT RISK 

You can try it with no obliga- 
tion. Our home trial lets you 
actually use The Pizza Program 
for a full 30 days before you de- 
cide to keep it. Watch the fun and 
convenience it creates. Enjoy 
better meals and see how much 
time it saves. If you are not satis- 
fied for any reason, return it 
within 1 month for a prompt and 
courteous refund. Your invest- 
ment is j ust $34.50 plus $2.00 for 
shipping and handling. (Califor- 
nia residents add 6'/?% sales tax.) 
A full 40 pages of instructions are 
included. And, it will be shipped 
promptly by first class mail. 

OUT OF THE RUT 

One woman's reaction to this 
program is typical. She wrote, 
"Before using your system I 
found myself getting into a rut of 
serving the same things over and 
over. The Pizza Program has 
changed all of this for me We 
now have a wider variety of din- 
ners and best of all I don't have 
to decide what they will be. If this 
was all it did, I'd be thrilled. But it 
isn't. The shopping list I receive 
along with my menus has been 
such a time saver. I quickly run 
through it and delete anything I 
feel I don't need and add some- 
thing I might. I would have a hard 
time going back to doing my 
menus by hand." 

This system requires an Apple II 
Plus* with 48K and 1 disk drive.

1985 WAS NOT A VERY GOOD YEAR. 

THE RUSSIANS INVADED GERMANY, 
STORMED THE PERSIAN GULf, 
ATTACKED NORVWAV, AND 
OVERRAN THE BALTIC. 



**★ 





INTRODUCING OUR NEW SERIES OF WARGAMES: 

WHEN SUPERPOWERS COLLIDEI 



SSI has just turned the Cold War into 
a very hot one. We've produced an 
entire line of v^argames under the title: 
WHEN SUPERPOWERS COLLIDE* Each 
game in the series presents a different 
scenario of probable U.S.- Russia con- 
frontations in various parts of the world. 

The first four releases are GERMANY 
1985,' RDF " (in the Persian Gulf), 
NORWAY 1985r and BALTIC 1985.' 

Designed by Roger Keating, creator of 
SSI's highly-acclaimed SOUTHERN COM- 
l\/IAND'," these strategy simulations boast 
the same successful look and play as 
his previous masterpiece: beautiful color 
graphic displays, easy-to-use movement 
system and realistic combat rules. 

In GERMANY 1985, battalions of 
Soviet infantry, tanks, artillery units, and 



'4aK disc tor the Apple II witli Applesoft ROt/lcard. 



paratroopers have breached the southern 
center of West Germany through the 
Fulda Gap. NATO forces must contain 
and repel the Red invasion. 

We've introduced several innovative 
rules to this game: Speed of movement 
is inversely proportional to the number 
of enemy units that can see you: smoke 
screens can be called upon to help cover 
an attack or retreat; and the concepts 
of HQ units, divisional integrity, and air 
superiority are fully incorporated. 

For improved playability, the computer 
can actually move and fire for you. For 
example, if you w/ish to move from point 
A to B, simply order the computer and it 



will move the designated units along the 
most efficient path — stopping whenever 
enemy units are encountered. Or you 
can have the computer direct your 
artillery fire for you. In the solitaire 
mode, the computer can play either the 
Soviet or U.S. side. 

GERMANY 1985 (at $59.95) is more 
than the standard bearer for our new 
series. Its rulebook contains all the rules 
for the rest of the line.. ..which are priced 
at just $34.95 each! What you've got 
are four great modern wargames'at 
unbeatable prices! 

To see how you can decide the 
outcome of battle when superpowers 
collide, look for GERMANY 1985 " and

Clearly, Apple has the inside track on selling to their own franchisees, 
but that's been no guarantee of success in the past. 

For all of Miner's success, the best it could manage in January was a 
solid third place. Choplifter and VisiCalc traded places again at die top, 
with Choplifter regaining the lead. 

VisiCalc sales are clearly being impacted by Multiplan, which jumped 
from twenty-ninth to thirteenth. Those sales are coming directly out of 
VisiCorp's pocket. VisiCalc has successfully held off SuperCalc in the 
IBM market; now it'll have to test its muscle in the Apple market.

Have fun learning to play the ancient game of Reversi, more recently called by 
the name of Othello*. QS REVERSI is reaidy to challenge you to a game at any level. 
Beginners vyill find it easy to learn — soon you will be beating the computer at its 
lowest level of play But move up slowly, because QS REVERSI plays expertly at its 
highest levels There are 12 levels of play, and few humans can beat it above level 
10 QS REVERSI's excellent algorithms allow it to make its move decision very fast. 
Only at levels above 8 do you notice any delay at all, and at level 12 the maximum 
decision time is about four minutes. Wfe have found that QS REVERSI outplays 
other commercially available microcomputer Othello games, including Hayden's 
REVERSAL 

The instruction manual includes the rules of Reversi. Requires 48K of user 
memory. Sold on diskette only.

There were no changes in the composition of the Adventure 5, al-

Considerable weakness was noted among programs considered for

programs were strong enough to write home about. Oddly enough, two 
Home Accountant competitors made the list: Chequemate and The Ac-

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 5.9 percent of all sales of 
Apple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in February to ascertain their sales for the month 
of January. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold — such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and personal prefer- 
ence of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in February represented every geographical area of the continental 
United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index 
number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an 
arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correla- 
tive only for the month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index 
rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another 
month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 4.3 percent, which translates roughly 
into the theoretical possibility of a change of 4.82 points, plus or minus, in any index 
number.

was tied for eighth. Just as interesting was Word Juggler's accession to 
the mantle of most popular word processor, at least for one month, as it 
pushed Apple Writer HI back. 

The depth of the sales drop-off in January should serve as a warning 
sign to distributors and publishers. Whether there will be a shakeout of 
distributors, more publishers going to flooring plans, a combination of 
those alternatives, or something totally new may be the focal point of in- 
terest this year. 

Stan Goldberg thinks he knows the answer. Miner 2049er whispered 
it in his ear.

Take your marble to [ 
the top. Pick your spot

for a flip instead of a 
flop. Once you get it, 
the fun never stops! 
It's FLIP OUT — a 
crazy new strategy 
game for one or two 
players. Each marble

your time and plan 
carefully. Plan right 
and you'll flip, if you 
didn't you Flip Out! 



It is up 
to you to stop the 
invasion of the evil 
Quarriors and save 
Repton. You are armed 
with devastating 
Nuke Bombs, a Radar 
Screen, a Laser Gun 
and an Energy Shield. 
You'll need them all! 
You'll be attacked by 
Nova Cruisers and 
Single Saucers. You 
must avoid Spye 
Satellites and deadly 
Dyne-Beam Shooters 
and you must stop the 
Draynes from deplet- 
ing the Reptonian 
power supply. Repton 
is a battle so thrilling 
you'll be relieved to 
find out you're still on 
earth when it's over! 




AN 


AN I MATED STRATEGY GAME 


i 


^^H- presents ^^^^^^^^^H 




Turn your keyboard 
into a typing arcade! 
You can blast attack- 
ing letters and words 
right out of the sky. 
Type Attack was 
designed by a profes- 
sional educator and 
the fast action game 
experts at Sirius. It 
features 39 pre- 
programmed lessons 
and 60 user defined 
lessons. Great sound, 
graphics and a real- 
time words per minute 
bar make improving 
your typing skills fun! 




Talk about adventure 
on the high seas! 
You're blasting away 
at a squadron of 
enemy bombers and 
Kamikaze fighters from 
the deck of your P.T. 
boat. Suddenly you 
notice the sea is 
loaded with mines and 
an Exocet missile is 
screaming toward you 
on the horizon. Instinc- 
tively you jerk the joy- 
stick to the starboard, 
keeping your thumb on 
the fire button. Phew! 
That was close! Some- 
times it's hard to 
believe Wavy Navy's 
just a video game.
