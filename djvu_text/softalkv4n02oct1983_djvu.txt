CONTEST: 
TRICK OR TREAT 



Finally, a contest for kids! That's right, 
all kids under the age of one hundred fifty-two 
can play. 

The San Francisco Applefest takes place Oc- 
tober 28-30, and rumor has it that there will be 
a massive trick or treat in the Moscone Center 
on Monday, October 31. All you have to do is 
show up, tell the security guards you're there 
for the trick-or-treat party, and go in. Once in- 
side, go from booth to booth, with your plastic 
bag in hand, and ask for software, hardware, 
and other goodies from the exhibitors. It's easy! 

For those who can't or don't feel like taking 
part in the city-by-the-bay extravaganza, here's 
a contest for you. 

Later on in this contest, you'll find a list of 
fifty treats we want you to find. Some are or- 
dinary items you can find around the house, 
while others are not-so-ordinary items you 
probably couldn't find in a hundred years. This 
complicates things a bit. The ordinary items of- 
fer no challenge, and the others make the con- 
test impossible. 

Through the miracle of magazine publish- 
ing, we have been able to come to a com- 
promise. The treats we want you to find are 
scattered throughout this issue of Softalk, and 
all you have to do is flip through the pages, find 
them, and write them down. 

Some of the treats in question can be found 
in pictures, some are hidden in text, and some 
are indirectly referred to. For example, if the 
treat listed here were "candy bars," you would 
look for a picture of some candy bars, just the 
words, "candy bars," or even "Almond Joy." 
Finding either a picture or the words is good 
enough; you don't have to find both. In some 
cases, there will be several places where treats 



can be found. If this happens, you have to find 
only one. 

Sorry, finding them in the contest section of 
the magazine doesn't count, but anywhere else 
in the magazine does. That's right. You can 
look in articles, photographs, ads, drawings, or 
even your mailing label. 

Items on the treats list that refer to words, 
rather than pictures, must be found exactly as 
they appear here. For example, "safe deposit 
box" in number nineteen cannot be extracted 
from "safe deposit boxers." 

Get Your Costumes On. Number your 
paper from one to fifty, and write each treat by 
its corresponding number. When you have 
found a treat, write a short description of where 
in the magazine you found it. Example one: 
scissors — page 347, second paragraph, right- 
hand column, third line; if it helps, include the 
sentence you found it in. Example two: chop- 
sticks — the middle-left side of the Oriental Ex- 
press word processor ad on page 2. 

Simple? You betcha. Ah, but there is a small 
catch. Not all the treats listed on the next page 
are found in the magazine. Those you can't find 
are tricks. If you suspect that a certain item 
can't be found in the magazine, write "trick" 
after it. Example: Atari 810 disk drive— trick! 

We won't tell you how many tricks there are 
mixed in with the treats, but if you have really 
keen eyes you'll be able to figure it out. 

The trick-or-treater who compiles the most 
accurate list of tricks and treats will be treated 
to $200 worth of Softalk advertisers' products. 
In the case of a tie (ha!), the entry with the 
scariest appearance will receive special consid- 
eration. The tie, however, will be broken by the 
spooky random number generator.

ONTEST WINNERS 



July's I'm Bored with Games contest was 
one of the more popular ones we've had in a 
while. Most entries were quite imaginative and 
well written. If there wasn't a penalty for being 
overdrawn at the bank, we would have awarded 
$I(X) first prizes to about half of the contestants. 
Unfortunately, our bank isn't very understand- 
ing when it comes to contests, so we could have 
only one wirmer. 

Many entries seemed to contain similar fea- 
tures: 3-D holographic images, mind-controlled 
computers, and video screens in the form of 
geodesic domes. 

Since it was hard to tell one game from 
another, we also looked at game plot. Those 
that didn't have any plot at all were eliminated, 
and those that involved senseless violence and 
irrational destruction were also given the back 
seat. 

When the dust had cleared, the entry that 
stood out belonged to Sandra Caliguire (Ocala, 
FL), who submitted not only a game but an en- 
tire game system that had various modules 
available for it. One of the more original 
touches that Caliguire added to her Vicarious 
Simulations system was that some of the 
scenarios were historic rather than futuristic. 

Caliguire's winning entry is a home enter- 
tainment console as well as a computer game. 
Here it is, along with just a few scenarios: 

Vicarious Simulations. By Sandra Cali- 
guire. Are you frustrated by the lack of 
reality in today's fantasy games? 

Does receiving fifty-nine different inane 
answers to the command "cut tree" iriake 
you want to hang the adventure pro- 
grammer? 



If so, why not try Vicarious Simula- 
tions! 

Using only the freshest of hardware in- 
novations. Vicarious Simulations systems 
make your fantasies come alive. VS hard- 
ware required with all scenarios for full en- 
joyment: 

Holographic Digitizer and Viva Voice 
Speech Trapper. For ideal system startup, 
allow these devices to record your move- 
ment and speech for reference in real-time 
gaming. Up to a dozen different friends or 
family members can be stored on disk for 
recall in your fantasies. 

Insta-Laser Videodisc Recorder. Spe- 
cial analog interfaces carry disk informa- 
tion to the videodisc recorder, creating a 
video image of the fantasy in progress, 
which can later be shown on your own tele- 
vision—a fantastic way to impress friends 
and beat those rerun blues. 

Organic Modem (version 2.3, compati- 
ble with 6502 chip). Perfected after months 
of testing at the San Diego Zoo, this elec- 
tronically charged, electrode-studded head- 
band creates a two-way path between the 
computer and you. Your neuromuscular 
reactions to thoughts are coded as analog 
waves and transmitted to the Apple, which 
decodes the data instantaneously. No 
longer will the frustrated adventurer bang 
the keyboard in despair over two-word 
commands. Full thought parser included. 

Additionally, the Organic Modem will 
permit your Apple to transmit all sense- 
oriented data. Now you can actually taste 
that mug of brew and feel the slash of a 
sword. Most important, you will actually

see through the eyes of your character, in- 
stead of the monitor screen. You are the 
character. 

Current VS scenarios include: 
London 1350. Relive the merry olde 
days of yore, compleat with the realities of 
the Black Death vividly re-created. Watch a 
third of England waste away. Avoid family 
and friends in a desperate scramble for sur- 
vival. 

Washington D.C.: The Nixon Years. 
Guaranteed rollicking fun for all budding 
politicians and Watergate buffs. Join in the 
backroom schemes and trickery; will you 
be a minor aide, a major fool, or Tricky 
Dicky himself? See how long it takes to get 
caught. 

Star Trek, Again (for die-hard fanatics 
only). All one hundred episodes are includ- 
ed, as well as the movies and various 
springboard scenarios. Enlist as your fa- 
vorite character or become one of the face- 
less four hundred that walk the halls of the 
Enterprise. Manipulate events by your ac- 
tions! Sell your videodisc adventure to 
Gene Roddenberry as a movie premise! 

Caliguire will be skipping down to Personal 
Computer Center in Ocala, where she'll grab 
Penguin's Graphics Magician and a joystick as 
her prizes. 

Not everyone opted to create a game. Bruce 
Youmans (Utica, NY) followed the Bruce Art- 
wick/SubLogic school of thought and designed 
a simulation program. 

Youmans 's Rollercoaster Simulator includ- 
ed "Optoscan video contact lenses (RGB option 
available soon; specify prescription if any) that 
display every detail through sixteen inverted 
loops, twelve flaming hoops, and the Cave of 
Death. The lenses also read each eyelid posi- 
tion, acting as paddle controls for left and right 
banking of your coaster car." Whoa. 

Darren Vengroff (Lubbock, TX) is a little 
confused. We ran a contest like this one back in 
1946. Vengroff was probably thinking of that 
contest when he sent in his entry: 

Bounce. Bounce is the latest creation 
from the Texas A&M department of soft- 
ware engineering. The game uses the newly 
developed eight-by-eight hi-res graphics 



screen just patented by the Aggies' ad- 
vanced graphics research lab. 

At the beginning of the game, one of the 
sixty-four pixels on the screen lights up. 
This represents the ball. Incredible, isn't it? 
But wait, that's not all! Amazing as it may 
seem, a subroutine that's only 1.3 
megabytes in length causes the ball to move 
to an adjacent pixel. This continues until 
the ball reaches the edge of the screen. 

At this point in the game's develop- 
ment, the time required for the ball to reach 
the opposite edge has been reduced to an 
unbelievable 3.4 days. All this may have 
been too much for you, but there's still 
more. 

Once it reaches the edge of the screen, 
the ball will literally bounce, reversing its 
direction and returning to the edge of the 
screen where it began. Wow! Unfortunate- 
ly for game players, there is as yet no 
player interaction (except the thrill of 
watching the bouncing ball). 

Another drawback of Bounce is the fact 
that the game isn't available to Apple users 
due to the machine's lack of graphics and 
memory capability. Available in punched 
paper tape (software) or vacuum tube 
(firmware) forms for Eniac and Univac 
only. 

Marty Geil (Annapolis, MD) became bored 
with fighting imaginary monster enemies in 
Wizardry, so he solved the problem with his 
new game: 

Spellbinding! is the three hundred fifty- 
eighth Wizardry scenario. The object is to 
descend all fifty levels of the dungeon, 
touch the fearsome slimedragon George, 
say, "You're it," and then escape with 
your life. 

Where this game really shines is at 
those points in your wanderings at which 
you encounter monsters. No longer do you 
have to imagine the battle taking place. In- 
stead of drawing a picture on your monitor, 
this version makes use of your Applink 
telepathy card to hypnotize people passing 
nearby, transport them to your house, dress 
them in monster costumes, and send them 
to fight you. 



Microsoft Sof tCard systems 
introduce your Apple to tiiousands

Fastalk is a quick guide to popular, specialized, 
new, and classic software. When you need a particu- 
lar kind of program or just want to see what's new, 
Fastalk is the place to look for fast answers. 

If a program has been reviewed in Sofialk, it car- 
ries the issue date of the review in italics at the end of 
its listing, and the capsule description given reflects 
the published review. 

A new software entry, which must be of profes- 
sional quality to be included, is designated by a check 
mark preceding its name. A new entry loses its check 
mark after its first appearance and drops out of 
Fastalk after one to three appearances (depending on 
genre) if it fails to gain popularity. 

A bullet preceding a title indicates a program that 
Sofialk has designated as a classic, based on its ability 
to stand up over time, its significance for its time 
(breaking new ground or introducing a new genre), or 
its archetypal qualities. 

Other entries in Fastalk are there either by virtue 
of current activity (the programs are selling at least as 
much as the least-.selling entry on any of the bestseller 
charts) or because they are representative of the best 
of programs for a special interest or need (such as 
card games or non-Basic-specific language terminal 
programs). 

Sofialk may arbitrarily omit any package from 
Fastaik, whether or not it meets the foregoing 
criteria.

Howa fireman 




and a broken leg 
softH^are simple. 



^^^^/hat does a fireman know 

▼ ▼ about designing software? 
Nothing. Usually. 

Meet Dennis Jarvis, a fireman 
from Southern California. He's 
married, three kids. And a dog. 

About five years ago, Dennis had 
a fire-related accident. Not serious, 
just a fall off somebody's back 
porch and a broken leg. But it did 
confine him to the house for about 
six months. 

To keep him occupied, Dennis' 
wife bought him a computer. 

Dennis had never used a com- 
uter before. He had no previous 
knowledge of how they work, no 
technical training. So Dennis just 
learned by doing. With patience 
and a lot of hands-on practice. 
He proved to be quite a natural. 

Before long, Dennis was writing 
his own programs. And Basic 
Accounting, the first program from 
Firefighter Software was born. 

It was brilliant. Naturally. 

THE IDEA BEHIND 
BASIC ACCOUNTING. 

Sheer simplicity is what makes 
Dermis' software so innovative. 
Because he approached his ideas 
from self-taught, extremely practical 
understanding. 

Take his original package. Basic 
Accounting for Apple and Atari. 
UnUke the best-selling accounting 
program. Firefighter requires no 
understanding of basic accounting 
theory. It's based on a simple 
system of positive and negative 
numbers. Firefighter's Basic 
Accounting is extensively "error 
trapped", too. So it's virtually 
impossible for you to type something 
that will damage either the program 
itself or any data you've entered. 



BUT IT'S FAR MORE THAN 
JUST EASY. 

Don't get the wrong idea. Just 
because Demiis made his software 
simpler doesn't mean it's not 
smarter. He added more capabilities 
than the number one seller. More 
practical features, too. 

Like an unlimited number of 
checkbooks, charge cards, savings 
accounts, petty cash and separate 
business accounts. Firefighter can 
also handle an unlimited number of 
individual financial transactions. 
And all balances are automatically 
updated after each entry. And those 
entries appear in a long form (for 
original entry) and a short form for 
quick review. That helps to speed 
up editing! 

AND THAT'S JUST 
SCRATCHING THE SURFACE. 

There's Password Protection. So 
your financial records aren't open to 
just anyone. 

You can prmt checks of any size 
and format. Even add an address for 
envelopes with a window. 

Firefighter can create a variety 
of on-screen and prmted 
reports— Budget Reports, Audit 
Reports, Income and Expense 
Reports, and Search Reports. It even 
creates on-screen graphs to give you 
a look at how your money is 
flowing. 

Every report can be printed on 
standard 8V2 by 11 paper (without 
special wide carriages or compressed 
print codes). 

Every screen can be dumped to 
the printer without damaging the 
screen or any saved data. 

And the list goes on... 



Dennis? He's still a fireman. 

Although he returned to the 
Department soon after his leg 
healed, he is still the guiding force 
behiiid Firefighter. 

In fact, in his never-ending 
efforts to make Firefighter the most 
personal, most supported software, 
Dennis set-up a telephone hotline. 
To answer any questions, help solve 
problems, Usten to your comments 
and provide consultation. That's his 
way of insuring Firefighter remains 
simpler yet smarter.

System Saver " 

The most important penplieral tor your Apple n and lie. 





For Line Surge Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides es- 
sential protection to hardware and 
data from dangerous power surges 
and spikes. 




SYSTEM SAVER 
APPLE II 



For Cooling 

As soon as you add 80 columns or 
more memory to your Apple II you 
need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral 
cards generate more heat. In addi- 
tion, the cards block any natural air 
flow through the Apple n creating 
high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the 
cards and the computer itself 



For Operating Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two 
switched power outlets. As shov\m 
in the diagram, the SYSTEM 
SAVER efficiently organizes your 
system so that one convenient, 
front mounted 
power switch 
controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple E, 
monitor and printer. 



Available m 220/240 Volt 50 Hz 



MONITOR 










APPLE II 









By connecting the Apple II 
power mput through the SYSTEM 
SAVER, power is controlled m two 
ways: 1) Dangerous voltage spikes 
are clipped off at a safe 130 Volts 
RMS/175 Volts do level. 2) High fre- 
quency noise is smoothed out be- 
fore reaching the Apple H. A PI type 
filter attenuates common mode 
noise signals by a minimum of 
30 dB from 600 khz to 20 mhz, with 
a maximum attenuation of 50 dB. 




SYSTEM SAVER provides cor- 
rect cooling. An efficient, quiet fan 
draws fresh air across the mother 
board, over the power supply and 
out the side ventilation slots. 



The heavy duty switch has a 
pilot light to alert when system is 
on.You'U never use the Apple power 
switch again! 



Easy Installation 



Compatible with Apple Stand 



Just clips on. 
No mounting or 
hardware required. 
Color matched 
to Apple n.

THE 

STATISTICS 
SERIES'" 

FLEXIBLE • ACCURATE 
EASY-TO-USE 



THE STATISTICS SERIES is the statistical 
software system for the student or 
professional. 

With THE STATISTICS SERIES, you can set 

up your own statistics workstation to rival 
a mainframe computer. Why switch from 
mainframes? Because you're in charge 
when you do, in touch with your data in 
ways not possible with a mainframe. 

REGRESS II gives multiple regression pre- 
dictive power to users in finance, engi- 
neering, medicine or social science. 
Choose solution types from simultane- 
ous, stepwise, forward, backward, or 
power polynomial solutions. 

ANOVA II performs simple or sophisticated 
analyses of variance for agriculture, medi- 
cine or social science. Run the most com- 
plex anova designs easily and quickly. 

STATS PLUS is a number cruncher for mar- 
ket research, business, finance, biology, 
and social science. Besides the general 
statistics and nonparametrics, this pro- 
gram offers data management and five- 
way crosstabulations of questionnaire 
data. 

CALGU-PLOT is a problem solver for busi- 
ness and finance, engineering and sci- 
ence. After you set up the equation and 
vary the constants, CALCU-PLOT finds 
the solution and displays the results. 

THE STATISTICS SERIES produces carefully 
organized statistical reports and graphics 
displays. 

THE STATISTICS SERIES programs come 
with a 10 day money back guarantee. Buy 
them together or separately at a most 
attractive price.

Open Discussion gives you the chance to air your 
views and concerns, to seek answers to questions, to 
offer solutions or helpful suggestions, and to develop 
a rapport with other readers. It 's what you make it, so 
share your thoughts, typed or printed, and double- 
spaced (please), in Softalk'i Open Discussion, Box

Boo! This month artist Cecilia Ziemer Watson 
must have really been in the Halloween spirit when 
she created the picture above, using the Utopia 
graphics package by Todd Rundgren with the Apple 
Graphics Tablet. The end of Open Discussion may be

jump out and scare you! 



Out of the Closets 

I have been an Apple owner since 1978 and 
have always enjoyed going up to my study after 
dinner, when the kids were on their way to bed 
(or at least to their rooms), and pursuing my fa- 
vorite hobby of computing. Over the years, I 
gradually added peripherals, books, and 
magazines, until my study bristled with evi- 
dence of my hobby. Having young children, 
and being wise to their destructive ways, I even 
locked the study from the outside so no one 
could enter. It worked! No one entered, except 
me. The room took on an aura of a sanctum, 
very quiet and also very lonely. This process 



occurred slowly but inexorably. My children 
began to express interest in the machine and 
were allowed to touch it only under direct su- 
pervision by me. Clearly something had to be 
done to reintegrate the household. 

Recently, I acquired an Apple lie and took it 
up to the holy room to sit by its older brother. 
The problem was that there was no room for the 
new arrival at all. That did it! I brought the 
whole mess downstairs to our unlived-in living 
room and, in an afternoon when the kids were 
away, rewired everything and set up both Ap- 
ples on a big table in the living room. 

Don't worry, I said to my wife, they will 
learn to use them and not abuse them. For once 
I was right! The children have laid claim to the 
Apple II, have learned to turn it on, boot disks 
at will, play games to their hearts' delight, and 
to regard it as fun. (They are too young to use it 
for problem-solving yet.) No catastrophe has 
occurred, the only spill has been my coffee, and 
the living room is living up to its designated 
name. Other added benefits have been the gain- 
ing of an additional room and the addition of my 
wife, a former computer widow, to the fraterni- 
ty (sorority?) of computer users. I don't know 
how many others have had an experience simi- 
lar to mine, but the contrast in our home has 
been considerable and markedly positive. I 
don't know the long-term effects on our chil- 



dren, but the short-term effects on all of us have 
been beneficial. So to all of you with Apples, 
kids, and patient wives— get the Apples out of 
the closets and into the living rooms. 
Frederick M. Gise, Wagoner, OK 

A Worthwhile Journey 

After long deliberation and agonizing, I finally 
bit the bullet and bought an Apple II Plus. On 
that fatefiil day I knew I had gotten a good buy, 
even though it meant a sixty-mile drive. What a 
long trip, but what a happy day when we 
brought our Apple home. 

Little did we know at the time what a 
marvelous deal we had gotten. Not only did we 
get the best price on the computer we wanted, 
but we got the best salesperson. Barbara 
Purcell, manager of Media Pack in Clarksburg, 
West Virginia, sold us our Apple II Plus, but 
there was much more to the transaction than just 
an exchange of money for equipment. There 
was courtesy to me and, more important, to my 
two sons. I say that because so many salespeo- 
ple fail to recognize someone under eighteen as 
a person with knowledge and discretion. Ms. 
Purcell treated all of us with the utmost dignity 
and has continued to do so. It is worth the sixty- 
mile trip just to get something as minute as a 
cartridge ribbon for our printer, and we can get 
those in the town where we live!

Those Sneaky Paddles 

We recently ran into a situation that could be of 
interest to other He owners. The other night we 
were debugging an assembly language program 
and had to turn off the computer because it had 
"locked up." When we turned it back on, the 
Apple was putting stuff on the screen. If we 
pressed any keys, it played some tones. It 
wouldn't boot. We turned it off and on several 
times only to have the same thing occur. 

We're not new users. Our Apple 11 is nearly 
five years old now, so we've seen a few hard- 
ware troubles in our lives. We eventually 
popped the top and pushed on all the chips and 
cards to make sure everything was making good 
connection, but we saw no improvement. We 
sat back, in anger and frustration. It was after 
midnight, on a weekend, and we had a pile of 
work to get in the mail Monday morning. We 
thought about what we were seeing. It appeared 
that the Apple was running its built-in RAM 
test. Normally this is invoked by pressing the 
closed-apple key when you turn on the com- 
puter. Nothing was touching that key, but it 
seemed possible that the key had gone out. 
However, the closed-apple key is the same as 
button 1 on the paddles. After a little searching 
we found our paddles buried under a pile of 
papers and reference books. We turned on our 
Apple and it booted fine. The weight of the 
papers was enough to press down button 1 so 
that, as far as the Apple knew, it looked like the 
closed-apple key was being pressed. 

Moral of the story: Never trust a game pad- 
dle that's unseen; it may be conspiring with 
your Apple lie to prevent you from rebooting. 
Here's another thought if your lie still insists on 
checking itself. Disconnect your game paddles 
or joystick to make sure it hasn't gone flaky. It 
might save you a trip down to the shop and sev- 
eral days without your Apple, not to mention 
the dollars to have it checked out.

A Hardware Star 

I would like to say a few words about 
Hollywood Hardware and its Ultra ROM 
Board. I bought the board a couple of months 
ago and have had several subsequent dealings 
with the company. The board is better than I ex- 
pected! It has vast capabilities and has made my 
programming and editing a lot easier. The peo- 
ple at Hollywood Hardware have been extreme- 
ly helpful and eager to back up their product. I 
have no reservations about recommending this 
company and its product. 
M. Steven Cook, Anderson, SC 

Words and Toys 

A few weeks ago, I bought the Proofreader and 
Thesaurus from Aspen Software in Tijeras, 
New Mexico. I couldn't be more pleased with 
these two pieces of WordStar-com^&tMe soft- 
ware. At least / use them with WordStar. Before 
receiving these two pieces of software, I 
thought that WordStar was the most wonderful

piece of stuff available. Not so now, although it 
runs a close second. I say second, because as far 
as I am concerned, both of these Aspen prod- 
ucts tie for first. I don't know which I like 
better. 

The Proofreader replaces SpellStar and does 
so with extreme grace. The simplicity of use, as 
well as the ease with which one can update the 
main dictionary, makes this the ideal spelling 
correction system. Not only does it show you 
the word that it doesn't recognize, it shows you 
(if you want) a list of possible correct spellings 
for the word— those words that are nearest to it 
alphabetically. The dictionary is over lOOK, so 
if a person does not have a high-density disk 
storage system or a hard disk, it may be a little 
unwieldy. I guess that problem could be cor- 
rected with multiple drives, but I have a Micro- 
sci A70 double-density drive; so all of it fits on 
just one side of one disk for me. 

On the other side of the same disk, I have the 
Thesaurus. I'm not sure just how many words it 
has, but it has plenty for me and is extremely 
easy to use. You simply place the cursor on the 
word that you're not pleased with and, while 
editing your text, press the escape key twice. At 
the top of the screen a list of possible replace- 
ment words will appear. Then, when you've de- 
cided which word you want to use, you move 
the cursor to that word and press a key. Voila, it 
automatically replaces the word in the text with 
the new word chosen. After that, you simply re- 
justify the paragraph if the length of the line 
changed. 

Both of these products have my vote for best 
word processing software of the year, and I 
think the person who wrote these programs 
ought to be given the Nobel Peace Prize, for 
bringing man and computer together in a friend- 
ly, warm atmosphere. Again, my congratulations 
to Aspen Software for its great success in writ- 
ing these two programs. 

A third product I recommend is the re- 
placement keyboard from Executive Peripheral 
Systems. I have always felt that WordStar was a 
little extravagant with all those control keys. It 
is sometimes difficult to find the function I 
want, paging through the menus. This keyboard 
eliminates that problem for most of the fre- 
quently used commands. When you wish to use 
WordStar, you simply put the WordStar CP/M 
PROM into place under the lid of the keyboard 
and place the overlay over the user-function 
keys. 

This keyboard is so handy and easy to use 
that my roommate (who has a very bad short- 
term memory and refused to use WordStar 
because he couldn't remember the commands) 
has started writing his own letters and now has 
the incentive to learn to use the computer. 
That's amazing! I could never get him to do it 
before. 

The only other problem I have found with 
the board occurs when you change a PROM; 
You have to turn the computer off or disconnect 
the keyboard from the computer for a second. I 
may install an on/off switch to the keyboard to 
replace this inconvenience. The instruction 
manual says you can put the computer away, 
someplace where it is not in the way. But if you 
have to reach the computer to turn it on and off, 
how can this be done? I have a foot switch, for- 



tunately, because of all of the plug-ins I need, 
but I don't like turning the whole thing off just 
to do a power-reset. Perhaps the manufacturer 
will take the hint and add the switch.

Pust-Mortem Replacement 

I have just had a fabulous experience with Sirius 
Software that I would like to share. Quite a 
while ago I bought Wayout from Sirius. It is a 
superbly produced piece of software; the 
graphics are amazing. After I played it for an 
extremely long time, it died— probably from 
overuse. Two days ago, I sent the disk back to 
Sirius, requesting another copy and a replace- 
ment bill. Today I received it, and without a 
bill! Now that's what I call service. 
Brett Juilly, San Mateo, CA 

Among the Good 

Several months ago I purchased a copy of 
Screen Writer II from a software mail-order 
house. Within a few weeks the package arrived. 
To my dismay, the very first page of the in- 
struction manual advised that the enclosed disks 
were for use with Applesoft and that an Integer 
version of the package would be provided with 
the return of the two disks and registration card. 
I bit the bullet on this one, since I couldn't recall 
if the dealer had been informed as to the model 
of my Apple. I returned the disks directly to Si- 
erra On-Line, since past experience had shown 
that living overseas is conducive to what I can 
describe only as "The Little Bo-Peep Syn- 
drome"— that is, our mail packages always 
seem to "lose their way." In addition, at 
$12.85 a minute, a person thinks twice before 
he reaches out to touch someone via telephone. 
To me, an 800 toll-free number means three ad- 
ditional digits I must quickly attempt to enter 
before the phone lines go dead again. 

Quicker than you could name the number of 
Apple look-alikes, I received a letter from Mary 
Fenton, product support manager at Sierra, ad- 
vising me that a new set of disks had been 
mailed and that I should return my disks after 
receiving the replacements. In other words, I 
was given the opportunity to stay in business 
until the replacements arrived. (Now, if I only 
had an Apple II Plus in which to use the disks.) 

The replacement disks worked perfectly 
from day one. Then came day two! For no ap- 
parent reason I couldn't get the editor part of the 
program to load. Again I wrote to Ms. Fenton 
and she said they would work on a fix. The fix 
turned out to be another set of replacement 
disks, not yet on the market from what I could 
tell, and a letter apologizing for any inconven- 
ience I had suffered thus far. It is important to 
note that each letter from the company always 
reminded me of my option to obtain a full 
refund. 

If you've been keeping count, that makes 
two different exchanges, at no additional cost, 
that have taken place up to this point. The story 
doesn't end here. Just recently I received an- 
other letter accompanied by a questionnaire in 
which they want me to evaluate the new version 
of Screen Writer II. In addition, at the conclu- 
sion of the evaluation period, they're sending 
me a whole new package, including all new 
documentation.

GAME DESIGN BY MIKE RYEBURN 




How TO UNSCJ 

TOUR NESI 



It doesn't take a computer to tell 
you that money can't buy you 
happiness. 

But at last there is a piece of per- 
sonal computer software that can make 
you a lot happier about your money. 

And you're looking at it. 

Who needs it? 

Dollars and Sense"' is designed for 
everyone who wonders where their 
money is going. Or why it isn't going 
as far as it used to. Or even as far as it's 
supposed to. 

It's designed for peo- 
ple on a budget. And for 
people who aren't. 

It's designed for 
people with expense 
accounts. And people 
who just want to 
account for their 
expenses. 

For people who don't 
know a thing about computers. And 
people who know everything. 

For people who can't balance a 
checkbook. And people who can do 
it in their sleep. 

And if you've read this far, it's 
designed for you. 




Where have all the dollars gone? 

Dollars and Sense saves you money 
by organizing your money. By giving 
you the clearest picture you've ever 
had of your financial behavior. 

You can establish budgets along 
any lines you like. Monthly or annu- 
ally. Fixed or variable. On up to 120 
accounts. 

It can write checks, make transac- 
tions automatically, even remind you 
to pay your bills. 

And as time goes by, it tells you 
exactly how you're doing. With a com- 
plete set of reports and 
full-color graphs! 

Year-to-date summa- 
ries. Income statements. 
Balance sheets. Cash 
flow analyses. 
Monthly and yearly 
comparisons of 
where you wanted to 
be vs. where you are. 
You can look into the future to dis- 
cover how much damage that new car, 
new driver, new dress or new baby 
will do to your budget. 

Or look into the past to find out 
anything you like. Like how many bar 




''■/ /

tabs you picked up in February. 
How much unleaded you 
pumped in July. 

Or whether your utility 
bills have gone far enough through the 
ceiling to justify a new roof. 

And all you have to do is spend 
a few minutes each week telling your 
IBM® PC, Apple® II or He what came in 
and what went out. 

Tax break. 

You can use Dollars and Sense 
around the house or around the office. 

And around April 15, you'll be 
glad you did. Because a few simple 
keystrokes will present you with all 
the information you need to satisfy 
Uncle Sam. 

If you do your own Long Forms— 
or your own loan applications— you'll 
save time. If someone else does them 
for you, you'll save money. 

Year after year 

User friendly. Really. 

Dollars and Sense also happens 
to be very easy to use. For everyone 
who uses it. 

If you're a novice, at computing or 
accounting or both, don't worry. 




The interactive demonstration disk 
will get you started. And the program 
will keep you going. With sample 
accounts, on-screen prompts and two 
different beeps. 

One for typographical errors. And 
another for other kinds of errors. 

As you get faster, so does Dollars 
and Sense. You can enter and edit large 
amounts of information, right on the 
screen. Move from function to function 
without waiting around. And get 
instant, up-to-date reports. 

On screen. Or on paper 

And one more thing. Dollars and 
Sense is tax-deductible. 

But only if you use it on your taxes.

In my years in both the private and govern- 
ment sectors, I have never witnessed such prod- 
uct support. You should appreciate the fact 
that, barring the first Applesoft disks, I was 
never totally without a word processing capa- 
bility. From the day the premier issue of Softalk 
arrived on my doorstep, I have read of "the 
good, the bad, and the ugly" of the computer 
market. Sierra On-Line is among the good. And 
on that you can bet "a fistful of dollars." 
Walter W. Frank, New York, NY 

Custom Packages 

I agree with readers who feel that many off-the- 
shelf software packages are extremely clumsy 
for the first-time user. There is, however, at 
least one software house that offers general ac- 



counting packages with a warranty of useful- 
ness to the customer. This company is Personal 
Computer Consulting and Services. The pack- 
age is not distributed through major chains but 
is sold directly to the end user with any needed 
customization to tailor the package to his busi- 
ness. Training and after-sale support, as well as 
a guarantee to provide future modifications to 
the package as the customer's requirements 
change, are provided. This level of support and 
training costs more than the price of the typical 
off-the-shelf software, but I feel it is well worth 
the higher price.

essing programs in the early days of Appledom. 
I bought my first copy three years ago and have 
never regretted it. The publisher has cautiously 
and deliberately upgraded thie program over the 
years (twice so far), and I am not aware of any 
"buggy" upgrades being released prematurely. 
Muse Software has endeared itself to me 
because the company lets you keep both the old 
manual and the old program, which are com- 
patible with the upgrades. Upgrades cost fifty 
dollars; I feel that's reasonable, all things con- 
sidered. The program is compatible with most, 
if not all, hardware for the Apple. For instance, 
it works with Mountain Computer's Multifunc- 
tion Card, whereas I have had to send Word 
Handler (the program I am forced to use at 
work) back for modification. Super-Text also 
includes printer parameter files for use with 
most popular printers. 

I would like to warn people about possible 
problems with Word Handler. At work I have 
tried to use it to keep my boss happy. I finally 
said the heck with it— I have had files crash for 
no conceivable reason. I have had my time 
wasted by our secretary because the manual is 
useless, and I had to figure out how to operate 
certain "features" of the program by guess- 
work. This program has deficiencies I wouldn't 
tolerate in a $50 program, let alone a $200 one! 
The only good thing I can say is that Silicon 
Valley's service is excellent— unfortunately, 
you too often have occasion to use it!

Offsetting the Weaknesses 

Regarding the review of OptionX that appeared 
in Buttonwood Apples (May '83), Crawford 
Data has an update available to the original 
purchasers that provides for updating of 
volatility files with the Dow Jones Market Ana- 
lyzer. This offsets a major weak spot mentioned 
in the conclusion of the review. Other im- 
provements in the OptionX update include faster 
loading, as well as calculations of potential 
gains and losses based on statistical projections 
of possible price changes in the underwriting 
experience. 

Another advantage of this supplier is the 
backup provided by the author. I have found 
him both helpful and cooperative in my ex- 
perience with his software. 
William G. Daly, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada 

A Way through the Woods 

As a registered professional forester, I would 
like to inform readers of the formation of a new 
nonprofit membership organization aimed at en- 
suring ready availability of practical forest-re- 
source-related computer technology. 

The Forest Resources System Institute 
(FORS) is the result of the combined efforts of 
consulting foresters, state and federal forestry 
agencies, forestry schools, natural resource 
associations, extension forestry services, and

Ears to You 

Something potentially dangerous happened to 
me recently regarding microcomputers and I 
would like to pass a warning on. It started out 
quietly enough. Before I turned my car engine 
on, I thought I would sit and listen to the rain- 
drops bouncing off the roof. I heard the delicate 
popping sounds and appreciated the input of 
sound into my construction of reality. There 
was, however, a persistent high-pitch ringing in 
both of my ears. 

As an audiologist, I had the interest, knowl- 
edge, and access to sensitive detection equip- 
ment to investigate. What caused the ringing? 
Was it temporary? Was it dangerous? Where 
was the source? The answers were determined, 
and this ringing, dear Softalk reader, could hap- 
pen to you. 

I suffered from something called tinnitus. 
The subjective frequency I heard was a high- 
pitch whine I thought I had never heard before, 
but, upon reflection, I remembered that it some- 
times occurred whenever I turned a TV on, The 
high pitch then apparently went away. The in- 
tensity of the subjective whine was enough, in 
scientific terms, to drive me bonkers. 

Alas, I had just purchased my new pride and 
joy, a thirteen-inch color monitor. Man, this 
baby had everything. It had a 400-line reso- 
lution, fantastic color, adequate resolution for 
text, a separate RGB eight-pin input plug, sepa- 
rate audio amp and speaker, great external 
looks, and the price was right. It was the 
new Panasonic CT 1300D Data Grade color 
monitor. 

It also uses a 15,734 Hz (cycles per second) 
oscillator for its horizontal-scan synchronizing 
signal. This pure tone was the culprit. The tone 
was emitted at a 58-decibel sound-pressure 
level when the microphone of a sound level 
meter was placed next to the case. The 16,000 
Hz octave-band analyzer indicated that the 58 
dB dropped off to 34 dB at the average position 
of the operator's ear. All other potential signal 
sources were disconnected. When the monitor 
went on, the needle went up and stayed there. 
When the monitor went off, the needle went 
down and stayed there. That experiment was 
repeated many times with consistent and repeat- 
able results. 

According to the most recent literature on 
the subject, 58 dB and 34 dB are not noise- 
hazardous and should not cause tinnitus. The 
federal standard for the level of hazardous 
steady-state noise is 90 dB for an eight-hour 
period. As an audiologist and someone who has 
a hearing loss, I wish to warn all users of 
monitors that the monitors are emitting a poten- 
tially tinnitus-inducing tone at approximately 
16,000 Hz. Those whose hearing is normal may 
be unaffected and suffer no prolonged ringing 
or damage. However, previously damaged ears 
may be especially susceptible to this 15,750 Hz 
pure tone and may suffer further damage at 
emitted levels that are now thought to be non- 
hazardous. 

My ringing continued for forty-eight hours 
and then subsided, but it resumed with five min- 



utes of use of my old green screen. 1 now have 
my trusty NEC green screen in a sound-atten- 
uating enclosure of tape and felt. According to a 
noise-control engineer, this will adequately ab- 
sorb the tone if it is emitted from within the unit 
and not radiated from the metal cover. Cooling 
is another problem if the unit is covered. My 
ringing continues for a few hours at a time 
several times a day. 

The pure tone sound level from the NEC is 
slightly lower at 34 dB at the operator's ear 
compared to the color monitor with 36 dB. I 
also measured a ten-inch Panasonic color 
monitor, the CT 160. It had the highest levels of 
all with 44 dB at the operator's ear. The Apple 
II itself was devoid of any audio tones. (Radio 
interference is another area.) 

It may be that only previously damaged ears 



arc .susceptible to this very real, very pure tone 
being emitted from monitors. Here is a test to 
determine if the emitted tone is affecting you 
Call it the "on-ofT' test. If you have a prolonged 
ringing in your ears, give them a rest over a 
weekend. Then turn on your monitor and listen 
to hear if you can detect that it suddenly came 
on. Then turn off the monitor after a few 
minutes and see if you can detect whether the 
tone stopped. If you heard the tone start when 
the monitor was turned on, and continued to 
hear the tone, but could not detect that the tone 
stopped when you turned it off, then the tone 
probably has triggered tinnitus. If you can 
detect the tone starting and stopping with your 
turning the monitor on and off, you can probably 
assume you haven't been affected by the tone.

fects on humans may reveal that it is not the in- 
tensity of the noise that causes the damage but 
the pureness of the signal. A sharp knife cuts 
with little pressure; loud rock 'n' roll may be 
the butter knife and the quiet 15.75K Hz pure 
tone may be the razor blade. The horizontal 
scan synchronizing oscillator tone can be called 
the Japanese sword. 

The brain detects the tone because of the fir- 
ing of tiny hair cells in the inner ear. If the 
vibration causing the hair cells to move and fire 
is too strong, or too long, the hair cells break 
and, instead of firing in response to a stimulus, 
fire when they want to, causing the phe- 
nomenon known as ringing. My wife is very 
helpful to me when this happens. When I say, 
"My ears are ringing," she says, "Well, 
answer them." 

Televisions emit the same tone, but TV 
viewers sit further away than monitor users, so 
the effect is decreased. I measured the sets per- 
sonally, using a calibrated sound level meter in 
a sound-attenuated room, and I am solely re- 
sponsible for the numbers and conclusions. Sof- 
talk is not responsible for the accuracy of the 
tests or conclusions but hopefully will print the 
information for the potential health-and-welfare 
benefit of its readers. Returning the monitor 
was a distressful event because it took so long to 
choose it, justify the expense, and drive down to 
pick it up, and I really needed the color to help 
me get past the nineteenth maze of Snack Attack 
after starting at entry level five. One dot from 
maze twenty!

Holding His Nose 

It is clear that Charles T. Morrow (June Open 
Discussion) belongs to that class of people who 
are finding it intolerable to live in the atmos- 
phere of unrelieved tension that the deploy- 
ment of nuclear weapons has created — and who 
would just as soon get it all over with and 
launch a war against the Soviet Union right 
now. 

I found it curious that Mr. Morrow began 
his criticism (his own term, "diatribe," would 
be more accurate) by pointing out that Robert 
Marlow (April Open Discussion) is an expatri- 
ate—as if the choice by an American to live out- 
side America were somehow treasonous. This 
primitive tribalist mentality is one of the root 
causes of the present nuclear peril. Unfortu- 
nately, not only Mr. Morrow but also those of 
us who do not share his warmongering views 
are threatened with destruction. 

The American people, manipulated by the 
media as they are, are not yet so gullible as to 
accept the official government propaganda 
characterizing the Soviet Union as, in the clas- 
sic (and recent) words of President Reagan, 
"the focus of evil in the modem world." Nev- 
ertheless, there is a persistent war mentality be- 
ing fostered in this country, and the current 
crop of "war games" reinforces this mentality. 
If one does battle nightly with the evil Soviet 
tank divisions (entranced by the simulational 
capacities of the Apple), then one is more likely 
to support the real thing, which certainly prom- 
ises to be much more exciting than any com- 
puter game. 

Although the first use of nuclear weapons 
may not be the cornerstone of NATO's defense 
policy, their use (whether first, second, or 
third) certainly is. Mr. Morrow's justification 
for the deployment of nuclear weapons (and in- 
tention to use them "if necessary") is the 
"huge conventional arms superiority" sup- 
posedly possessed by the Soviets. The implica- 
tion is that nuclear weapons are necessary and 
will be used in the event of war. Given the enor- 
mous destructive powers of the nuclear arsenals 
on each side and the high probability of total 
retaliation against whomever pushes the button 
first, this policy constitutes a fine plan to com- 
mit racial suicide. Better dead than red, eh, Mr. 
Morrow? Well, speaking both personally and 
on behalf of my children and their children, I 
say this policy stinks. 
Alfred Roy, Berkeley, CA 

Collision Course? 

I have been a board war-gamer for about five 
years, with such games as Third Reich, Bis- 
marck, and StarFleet Battles. The only things 
these games represent is an exercise in strategy 
and tactics in a competitive environment. When 
I play one of these games, I don't particularly 
care about the political situation underlying the 
conflict. Personally, I think war is a stupid idea 
in real life, and the world would be a hell of a 
lot better off if, instead of an arms race, all the 
top brass of the world got together and played

Walk a Mile in My Boots 

I agree with the majority that copy protection 



should be removed from most products. 
However, there should be better laws to help 
small companies fight large-scale pirates. A 
small company simply carmot afford to prose- 
cute a pirate today. It is understandable that 
many companies are afraid of what will happen 
if they remove copy protection from their prod- 
ucts. After all, won't they lose many sales? 
Maybe so, but maybe not. 

I usually will not buy software that is copy- 
protected, simply because I like to list and 
modify programs. If I buy some hobby pro- 
grams, what good do they do me if I can't put 
them on the disk I'm writing programs on? I re- 
fuse to reboot a disk every time I think of a new 
modification to the program I'm writing! 

Another point, as Ira Strum mentioned (July 
Open Discussion), is that kids won't buy soft- 
ware if it takes them three or four months to 
save up for it. 

Schools don't help the fight against copy 
protection. I admit it isn't fair to make schools 
with a limited budget buy one copy for each 
computer, but there should be limits. What if 
seven school districts got together and bought a 
$70 program. Then they could make 140 copies 
of it and send them out to the schools. Would 
that be fair to the companies and programmers? 

I am thirteen years old and get $8 a month, 
plus what I make selling programs to a local 
company. One of the programs I wrote retails 
for $200, of which I get $140. This means that 
the above scenario would cause me to lose more 
than $10,000 of my hard-earred money! (For 
those who would question the "hard," I spent 
six months writing that program!) Pirates hurt 
programmers more than companies! Listen, all 
you pirates: Would you still copy programs if 
you wrote them for a living? 
Anton Rang, New Richmond, WI 

Fugitive from Goons 

I enjoyed seeing your August Job Hunt contest 
which concerns the former occupations of 
prominent computerists. As a result of this con- 
test, many people are now curious about what I, 
Jack Cassidy, was doing back in the mid- 
seventies. Well, as it happens, I was teaching 
creative writing in Colorado, and before that I 
was an obscure nuclear reactor technician in 
California. Then the eighties came, and DOS 
Boss made me famous. 

Some people (like my family) are also curi- 
ous about what I'm doing now. I'm very sorry, 
but that's strictly confidential under the terms of 
my contract. And I don't want Bert Kersey's 
goons coming after me.

Voter Registration 

I am looking for a routine that can be used in 
any program to scroll the hi-res screen up, 
down, left, or right. Any suggestions? 

I disagree with the Open Discussion letter 
complaining about how nobody reads Fastalk. I 
do, and enjoy it very much! It keeps me in- 
formed on any programs that slip past my local 
computer store. ( I do agree that some of those 
programs that are classics shouldn't be.)

new things like $19.95 games and unprotected 
graphics programs. I have the Graphics Magi- 
cian and it is the best graphics system I have 
ever owned. 

I think Apple should sue any imitators of its 
computers. When I saw the Franklin comput- 
ers, I was amazed that they could make them le- 
gally It was only a few weeks later that I learned 
that if I went to Japan I could buy an Apple 
software-compatible computer for under two 
hundred dollars. I believe that we Apple owners 
should march down to the nearest computer 
store that sells those computers and smash them 
into millions of pieces. All in favor say, 
"Aye." Finally— before I start my neighbor- 
hood march— I would like to give a word of ad- 
vice to software publishers: You should follow 
Penguin Software and lower your prices. This, 
in turn, would reduce software piracy, which 
you are all so eagerly trying to stop. 
Craig Weinhold, Madison, WI 

Not Too Shabby 

Hold on, folks! Don't we check the accuracy of 
the entries in Fastalk anymore? I refer to the 
first entry in the Communications section of the 
August issue, for Apple Link. It states, "Only 
modem software known that can transmit 
Screen Writer text files." Oops! This letter was 
written on Screen Writer on my Apple II Plus at 
home, sent via Data Capture 4.0 to my com- 
pany's big IBM, and then delivered to the IV 
Phase word processing machine in my office. It 
is printed on the letter-quality printer associated 
with the office word processing system. Now, 
that's not too shabby, is it? 

I don't even know of anyone using Apple 
Link, but I do know of scores of people doing 
just what I did here with Screen Writer and 
several of the other good communication soft- 
ware packages that transmit Apple DOS text 
files. Knocking the competition is said to be bad 
advertising strategy and it sure seems like bad 
strategy for Fastalk, especially when the infor- 
mation is incorrect! 
W.J. Griebstein, Cincinnati, OH 

Brain Power 

As a computer novice and accounting illiterate, 
I set out to make a home finance program my 
first major software purchase. I fear Softalk's 
Fastalk column almost led me astray. 

The Home Accountant is called "thorough 
and powerful. " The Accountant is more expen- 
sive and gets modest descriptions like "simple- 
to-use" and "a sleeper." The choice should be 
obvious. 

In fact, I believe The Accountant (the more 
expensive program) is so far superior as to 
justify the cost. It gives the user credit for 
brains but will handhold you through a 
remarkably effective double-entry system. That 
part might scare people off. In fact, it makes 
this program more enjoyable, as well as being 
educational and practical, but not more dif- 
ficult. The documentation and tutorial are ex- 
cellent, and Decision Support Software gives 
excellent user support. 
Henry Tenenbaum, Washington, DC 

It's a Frame-up! 

I didn't know the gun was loaded. Honest, Your 



Honor, I wasn't even in town that day. I'm 
throwing myself on the mercy of the court. 
Let's plea-bargain. Toss out the conspiracy 
charge and I'll accept guilt through association, 
or perhaps a sin of omission. 

Okay, my name was on the Plasmania pack- 
age (exhibit A for the prosecution), and I did 
associate with known Sirians, but I can explain 
all this. About a year ago (it all seems so hazy 
now), I was writing games for the VCS (alias 
Atari 2600) and I designed one called Fantastic 
Voyage. It was a 4K game written specifically 
for the capabilities and limitations of the sys- 
tem. So far, no problem. Then, from on high, 
came a management decision (is there any other 
kind?) to translate this and other VCS games to 
other formats. The Atari 400 versions were 
passable, and some of the VIC -20 conversions, 
programmed by the highly talented Leonard 
Bertoni of Pittsburgh, were quite good. Still no 
problem. Then the first 48K Apple conversion 
appeared, the results of which were covered in 
Softalk's Marketalk Reviews. I have no argu- 
ment with the review. Indeed, I applaud honest 
criticism, having taken some flak myself back 
in the days when I was writing reviews. But I 
didn't ask for my name to be emblazoned on the 
front of the package! That, Your Honor, was a 
frame-up. 

I feel good about the VCS games I wrote. 
Some were praised, some got mixed reviews, 
and one or two vanished without a trace. But I 
can accept no praise, nor share any blame, for 
anything they spawned in the way of conver- 
sion — with one exception. I did convert and up- 
grade Nexar for the Atari 400. However, for 



reasons too complicated to go into here, some- 
one else also wrote a conversion. I don't know 
which version, if any, will be released. Caveat 
emptor. 

So that's my story. Your Honor. I've gone 
straight. 1, along with my unindicted 
co-conspirators, Mark Turmell and Dan 
Thompson, have joined Activision. The defense 
rests. 

David Lubar, Sacramento, CA 
Lobbying for Kids 

I am thirteen years old. I've had my Apple II 
Plus for about two years now, and in school 
there are Apple classes for students in the fifth 
through the eighth grades. I've been taking the 
class for two years. I am in the eighth grade. 
Our school has six computers and hopes to get 
maybe ten more next year. 

I know that a lot of adults read Softalk but so 
do many kids! This is why I'd like to see more 
columns and contests especially for kids ten

The Real and the Imaginary 

I was very surpri.sed to read the following state- 
ment by Tom Weishaar in the August DOStalk: 
"The Integer file Applesoft is supposed to con- 
tain cassette (or disk) Applesoft, bu't it never 
does. In fact, there seems to be no evidence that 
Apple ever actually released a version of cas- 
sette Applesoft on disk. If any of you know dif- 
ferently, let us know." 

Tom, how much evidence do you need? You 
will find this forty-three-sector file on the Apple 
System Master disk for DOS 3.1, 3.2, and 
3.2.1. It simply has not been that long since that 
practice ended. The first time it didn't appear 
was on the DOS 3.3 System Master! 

All of the comments made by Weishaar on 
the much earlier Applesoft on cassette tape 
seemed accurate. The only point left out was

Spec Changes 

Regarding the article about the computer desk 
by Robert Stang (April '83): I'd like to suggest 
a few changes in the specifications. 

Piece number nine should be 17 '4 by 9 '4. I 
also suggest that piece number one be 1 8 by 48 
and piece number two be 18 by 23% rabbet. On 
special cuts piece number two, how about only 
one Vi by % rabbet, and on piece number one 
rabbet, how about only one end Vi by % . This 
allows a smooth surface over the entire top. 
You could also rabbet piece number nine into 
piece number six midway, as you choose.

High on Apples 

Howdy! I'm serving time in prison up here in 
the frozen north, Alaska, and during my stay 
here I discovered computers. Since resources 
here are severely limited, your magazine has 
been an invaluable aid to me while I've learned. 
I'm pretty spoiled here now. The administration 
has provided me with my own room, an Apple 
II Plus, two floppy drives, ten megabytes of 
Corvus storage, a Microline printer, and 
various add-ons and peripherals. I make three 
dollars a day writing database software for 
them. Needless to say, my Apple has replaced 
cocaine as my favorite mind-altering substance!

cussion, I have just written to the Apple PIE 
Writers to join that user group. Without realiz- 
ing it, I must have been waiting for the an- 
nouncement of that group to spur me into action 
of my own. The two programs I use the most 
are PIE Writer and Data Reporter by 
Synergistic Software. I believe these are, 
without question, the best word processor and 
database management programs available for 
the Apple. 

I am writing to ask if there is a Data Re- 
porter user group (DRUG) that anyone is aware 
of, and, if not, are there any DR users who 
would like to try to start one? I would be willing 
to act as a clearing-house to get the ball rolling. 
Anyone interested?

Still Poking Around 

Hello, remember me? I'm Matt Offenbacher 
and I wrote to Open Discussion a few months 
ago. I was the one who had some interesting 
pokes and peeks. Well, I'm back and here's 
another list! 

Remember the poke 50 (1-255) that 
scrambled the text output? If you poke 50, 128 it 
will make any output invisible. Even your 
listing! 

If you have this poke at the beginning of 
your program and at any point have an end 



statement, or if you break out of the program, 
when you type anything it reruns the program. 
This poke is handy: poke 214,255. 

If you want to protect your programs, use 
this. When this poke is used it makes the first 
line of the program list over and over. Try the 
sample program that follows: 

5 REM REMARKABLE PROGRAM! 

1 0 POKE 2049,0 (this is the poke) 

20 ?"THIS PROGRAM WILL ONLY LIST 

THE FIRST LINE OF THE PROGRAM, 

OVER AND OVER!" 
30 END 

How about this poke. It will spin your disk 
drive without reading or writing anything. You 
can even take your disk out and it will still spin 
without an error. Use poke 49385,0. To stop 
the drive after this, type poke 49384,0. Pretty 
neat, huh? Well now, check out this call. Be 
very careful using it. It locks up your whole 
disk and you can't write anything on it. Before 
using this, back up the disk you're using. I don't 
want to be sued! 

CALL 42340 

Until recently I didn't know that there was a 
Basic command called wait. This command 
works kinda like a peek when used with the 
right number. Anyway, use this to have the 
computer wait for you to hit a key: 
wait- 163 84, 128. 

Matt Offenbacher, Lake Oswego, OR 
A Shortened Version 

In the April Open Discussion, Raymond E. 
Green, president of Technocom, wrote in with a 
solution to a previous letter titled "No Small 
Change. ' ' The solution was that of putting num- 
bers into two decimal notation. I have a subrou- 
tine that I use extensively in all my programs for 
that same application. The one big difference 
between Green's solution and mine is that mine 
is a lot shorter. The program follows: 

10 REM 2 decimal notation 

20 L$ = "":U = 1 

30 IF A<0THEN L$ = "-":U = -1 

40 A$ = STR(INT((A + U)* 1 00 + .500001)): 

50 A$ = L$-HSTR$(INT(ABS(A)))-h"." 

+ RIGHT${A$,2) 

60 RETURN 

All a person has to do before entering the sub- 
routine is convert the variable in use to "A." 
After returning from the subroutine, convert A$ 
back to a usable variable in the program. 
John Byers, Hibbing, MN 

To Fellow Readers and Readable 

I am the proud owner of an Apple lie and wish 
to make a few comments about it. First of all, 
the Mini-Assembler is back on the He. Just boot 
Integer Basic from the DOS System Master, 
type int, then call -2458. You then get the "!" 
prompt and you are ready for assembly 
language programming. 

I enjoyed Don Worth's article (July '83) on 
the 560-by-192 graphics. It's even visible on an 
Amdek Color-I monitor. I noted a bug in the 
listing 2 program on page 126. Add this line: 

135 HC0L0R = 7

Rana's disk drive was 
twice as good as Apple's 
witii one liead. 




Now we iiave two. 





We added another head 
so you won't have to buy another disk. 

That's the beauty of a double sided head. A 
floppy disk which allows you to read and write on 
both sides. For more storage, for more information, 

for keeping larger records, 
and for improved perfor- 
mance of your system. 
That's what our new Elite 
Two and Elite Three offers. 
It's the first double headed 
Apple® compatible disk 
drive in the industry. And of 
course, the technology is 
from Ran a. We're the com- 
pany who gave you 163K 
bytes of storage with our Elite One, a 14% increase 
over Apple's. And now with our high tech double 
sided heads, our Elite Two and Three offers you two 
to four times more storage than Apple's. That's 
really taking a byte out of the competition. 

We put our heads together 
to give you a superior disk drive. 

We designed the Elite Three to give you near 
hard disk capacity with all the advantages of a 
minifloppy system. The double sided head oper- 
ates on 80 tracks per side, giving you a capacity of 
652K bytes. It would take AVz Apples to give you 
that. And cost you three times our Elite Three's 
reasonable $849 pricetag. 



Rana's double sided heads give Apple 
II superior disk performance power 
than second generation personal com- 
puters such as IBM's. 



It takes 4V2 Apples to equal the capacity 
of our superior Elite Three 





The Elite Two offers an impressive 326K bytes 
and 40 tracks on each side. This drive is making a 
real hit with users who need extra storage, but 
don't require top-of-the-line capacity Costwise, it 
takes 2^2 Apple drives to equal the performance of 
our Elite Two. And twice as many diskettes. Leave it 
to Rana to produce the most cost efficient disk 
drive in the world. 

We've always had the guts to be a leader. 

Our double sided head may be an industry 
first for Apple computers, but nobody was surprised. 




They've come to expect it from us. Because Rana 
has always been a leader We were the first 
with a write protect feature, increased capacity 




Your word processor stores 5 times as many pages of text on an Elite Three 
diskette as the cost ineffective Apple. 

and accurate head positioning. A first with attrac- 
tive styling, faster access time, and the conve- 
nience of storing a lot more pages on far fewer 
diskettes. We were first to bring high technology to 
a higher level of quality 

So ask for an Elite One, Two, or Three. 
Because when it comes to disk drives, nobody 
uses their head like Rana.

Also, I got confused on page 124 where it says 
that poke 49246,0 turns AN3 on. Actually, that 
poke turns it off. Apparently a change of state 
turns on the double-hi-res graphics. Sort of like 
negative logic. Am I right? Anyway, that poke 
is correct in the programs. 

Does anyone out there have the following 
combination— Apple lie with an eighty-column 
card and an Amdek Color-I monitor? If so, you 
probably already noticed that you can't decipher 
eighty-column text on that monitor. The follow- 
ing will make it more readable: 

10 PR#3:REM TURN ON 80-COLUMN CARD 
20 PRINT CHR$(15);;REM TURN ON 
INVERSE 

30 PRINT CHR$(12);:REM CLEAR SCREEN 

TO WHITE 
40 REM REST OF PROGRAM. . . , 

With black on white it's still not very good, but 
at least it's legible. 

Now for some rebuttal on comments made 
in past Open Discussions. To Alan R. Fischer: 
What are you going to do to the guy who burned 
your disk? To Norman Jonston and Ira Strum: 
Right on! To George VanWagner, Gary Mc- 
Pherson Mugford, and Robert Marlowe: Three 
boos! To Poppi Kosak: Are you reading the 
right magazine? To Richard Steck: That's an 
unnecessary warning. 

To whom it may concern (who owns an Ap- 
ple lie): What is the name for the following 
ASCII characters: \(96), \ (123),'»'(126)? 
Jerry Van Cleeff, Montgomery, AL 

Strange Behavior 

Before you finish thinking about trading up to a 
lie, let me tell you that it would probably cost 
more to sell or trade your II and buy the He than 
it would to buy a keyboard enhancer and a 
memory expansion card. The He also has some 
firmware problems that you might be unaware 
of— nothing that really affects the operation of 
the machine, just some items that make it seem 
a little like Jell-0 inside. (Not quite solid.) 

Take a He that has a disk controller in slot 6 
and the eighty-column card in the auxiliary slot. 
Type PR^4 or PR#5. Sometimes it will go out to 
lunch as expected; other times it will boot the 
disk in slot 6. Try typing PR#2 and sometimes it 
will turn on the eighty-column card and jump 
into the Monitor. It's strange! Turn on the 
eighty-column card with PR#3 and type about 
sixty to seventy characters. Now go back to for- 
ty columns by typing escape 4. The cursor ends 
up somewhere in the middle of the screen. Typ- 
ing something at this point will put a character 
there, and then the cursor will return to where it 
should be. Turn off the eighty-column card 
from a program using the method described in 
the manual— it disconnects DOS! 

Well, nothing is perfect the first time— but 
don't let anyone fool you into thinking the He is 
an incredible new machine. (Everyone was 
similarly fooled by the IBM pc, which is quite 
ordinary.) The most important part of its name 
is the II. It uses the same Basic and the same 
DOS (but they screwed it up a little trying to fix 
append). It's so much the same that Basic still 
doesn't understand lower case. Now here are 
some suggestions for a couple of readers whose 
questions appeared in the June Open Dis- 



cussion column. 

To T.J. 'Venable: You might check with the 
Aircraft Owner's and Pilot's Association. They 
have a flight-planning program similar to what 
you have described. It is available to non- 
members at a slightly higher price. 

To Judith Juskowich: Contact local user 
groups for help with your ideas; they can be a 
valuable aid. But why limit the computer's use 
to those considered gifted? 
Michael Gibbs, Denver, CO 

Ham Sandwich 

To continue the house ground wire discussion 
of Paul B. Brumbaugh (June) and Edward 
Parker (August): My grounding education be- 
gan with a radio ham's complaint that my Apple 
lie was blasting him off the air. He had fol- 
lowed his handheld receiver's signal to my front 
door; and there was no doubt that I was radiat- 
ing, probably illegally. My letter to the FCC 
asking for assistance in measuring radiation 
levels to determine conformance to FCC Rules 
Part 15(J) produced only a pamphlet telling me 
what to do if a ham was interfering with my TV 
reception. Go buy a filter, it said. (Evidently the 
FCC is unaccustomed to dealing with the 
general public's interference with licensed ham 
operation; it usually works the other way.) 

The problem was a faulty electrical connec- 
tion to the breaker panel in my house. The 
ground wires from multiple circuits had been 
braided together by the installing electrician for 
common clamping to the system ground, but the 
ground wire of one circuit (guess which one) 
was an inch short and was not included in the 
actual clamp connection. I rerouted the wire, in- 
cluded it in the ground connection, and the 
radiation problem vanished. 

It resurfaced, however, soon after I installed 
a Microtek RV-611C parallel interface (thirty- 
four-wire flat cable) to my new Prowriter. Only 
twenty wires are used in the interface, however, 
so I could solve this one by substituting a stan- 
dard twenty-wire shielded flat cable normally 
used for disk drive connection. 

Moral of the story: If a neighbor ham ap- 
pears on your front doorstep instead of on your 
TV set, you (not he) probably have a problem, 
and a litfle time and ingenuity can fix it. 
Dick Smith, Pensacola, FL 

Touchdown Time 

In response to Philip Arnold's inquiry (June 
Open Discussion), Touchdown Systems's 
Game Plan program enables even computer 
novices to make sophisticated database in- 
quiries about their opponents' play-calling fre- 
quencies and patterns. Any interested readers 
can obtain a brochure by writing to Touchdown 
Systems, 18 Stanford Avenue, Colonia, NJ

Plugging the Loop Hole 

For Mark Yannone (June Open Discussion), the 
problem with the Osbome/McGraw-Hill Trans- 
portation Algorithm is in line 830 1=0, which 
resets a loop counter to 0 on every pass through 
a loop and consequently never exists. Initialize I 
outside the loop by deleting line 830 and insert- 
ing 785 1=0.

Upper Escape Case 

This is a reply to Charles Patalive's letter 
(August Open Discussion) in which he stated he 
was unable to insert printer escape commands 
using the Videx eighty-column preboot with his 
Apple Writer II. His difficulties may simply be 
that he is not entering upper-case letters when 
entering the escape printer codes. 
Francis E. Flavin, Jr., Hatfield, MA 

Getting Decoded 

I have an answer to a question by Pete Higgins 
(August Open Discussion). Have you tried the 
instructions in Appendix B? They didn't work 
for me (I have a NEC Spinwriter 7720 and an 
Apple ni). Look in your printer manual for any 
sort of "codes." If there are some, try con- 
trol-V and type that code. For example, mine 



(for subscripts) is control-V, then escape colon, 
then the letter or number I want, and escape 
semicolon. Try it. 

I congratulate you on your August issue for 
having only a small amount of advertisements 
for things like strip poker. Garden of Eden com- 
puters, and such. Also, I noticed lots more 
advertisements pertaining to the Apple III. 
Thank you. 

Frank Hammers, Saint Martinville, LA 
Wrong Computer 

I need some printer help. I have a NEC printer 
hooked up to my Apple II Plus. The printer 
works fine, but the manual that comes with it 
shows many different fonts that can be done. 
The problem is, it's all written for the NEC. 

Can the Apple do all of these different fonts 
on this printer? If so, what are the commands? 
If the Apple cannot do all of these fonts, then 
would an EPROM IC work (I have a Grappler in- 
terface, the original type, not the Grappler -H)? 
Can the Apple do graphics on the NEC printer 
without having to use a utility program that 



loads a "B" program and dumps it? Isn't there 
a command to dump an Applesoft Basic 
graphics program to the printer? 

As you can tell, I'm actually using only half 
of my printer. I'd appreciate any response to 
this problem. 

John Flikeid, Annandale, VA 
How Do You Dump? 

I'm hoping that someone knows how to help me 
print graphics from a program I'm writing. I 
have a NEC PC-8023-AC printer with an Epson 
APL Board in slot 1 . I need some sort of screen 
dump for this program. I can't use Zoom Grafix 
on this. Any help I could get would be 
appreciated.

THE 

STANDARD 
SOLVES THE 
PAPER FEED 
PROBLEM! 



If you own a printer you 
recognize the problem: 
Where to store the paper so 
it can properly feed into the 
printer. On the floor 
the paper is difficult 
to reach, is vulnerable to 
damage and is susceptible to 
jams caused by misalignment. Stor- 
' paper behind the printer is equally 
frustrating as valuable desk space is wasted. 

The STANDARD solves the paper feed problem by storing hundreds of 
sheets in an attractive dispenser directly under the printer. Paper is fed 
properly, is protected from dirt and dust, and space is saved. 

The STANDARD is available in two sizes: Small (illustrated), accommo- 
dates the Epson MX and FX 80, C. Itoh Prowriter, Apple and IBM Dot Matrix 
and other similar printers. Large, fits wider carriage printers such as the 
Epson MX 100. 
Ask your dealer for the STANDARD or order directly by mail.

TURN AN EPSON 
INTO A DAISY... 

with the SUPER-MX CARD 

for the APPLE II or APPLE lie. 

The standard of printing excellence is the 
daisy-wheel printer. The SUPER-MX 
card provides the Epson printers with just 
about the same quality print as the daisy- 
wheels! And these fonts can be accessed 
by all software, even copy-protected 
diskettes. 

SUPER-MX Roman font is 
the standard. 
Epsons can now print Elite 
with the SUPER-MX card. 

Other optional font styles are available 
in addition to the standard Roman font 
that just plug into the extra sockets 
provided. They come in pairs so you can 
add a total of four extra fonts. Orator 
Large comes with Letter Gothic. Script 
comes with Olde English. 

LETTER GOTHIC is 
modern looking. 
ORATOR is easy to read 
and good for speeches. 
SCRIPT a<icLt> dtKe 
pen^cmaJl t.oucK. 
©CCE £N(5CS/Sa iz very 
farmal and elegant. 

BETTER THAN GRAPPLER! 

The Super-MX card has all the Apple 
Hi-Res graphic dump commands that 
the Grappler card has including: double 
dumps (both pages side by side), dump 
from page 1 or 2, double size, empha- 
sized, rotated, strip chart recorder mode, 
and text screen dump. 

The two expansion sockets allow 
EPROM expansion to 12K to insure you 
that the SUPER-MX card will remain the 
most intelligent interface around. 

MX-100 needs Graftrax-Plus. MX-80 
needs Graftrax or Graftrax-Plus. FX-80 
works as is. 90 day warranty.

only, I'll call up file A and find it mixed with 
Bs. I'm using an Apple II Plus with 64K and 
one disk drive. 

Following Sierra On-Line's suggestions, I 
have tried S (file name) to save, saved to a dif- 
ferent output file name each time I work, and 
limited the number of files per disk to no more 
than ten pages total. The company has replaced 
my Screen Writer II disks, but even with the 
new ones the problem persists. Other programs, 
such as VisiCalc and Magic Window, work 
perfectly on my equipment. 

Has anyone out there had the same problem 
and solved it? I'd appreciate knowing about it 
before giving up on the program, which I love.

Banking on It 

I would like to know if anyone can give me 
directions for utilizing printer commands for an 
Epson MX-80 F/T with Bank Street Writer on 
an Apple He. I know that they cannot be embed- 
ded in the word processing itself. 
Jay Cooper, Kansas City, MO 

Overlap Delay 

I use a filing program called PFS.File quite 
often in my job. When I enter the print function 
of the program, I tell it to print something and 
then go to the next line. The command I am us- 
ing is the proper one, but when printing time 
comes, all of the words and information overlap 
each other. It seems that the advance to the next 
line does not work in my PFS:File program. 
Can anyone help me? This problem is causing 
delays in my work. 
Sean Roberts, New Orleans, LA 

File Help 

Perhaps Softalk readers can offer me some as- 
sistance. I have an Apple He without the eighty- 
column board and an Epson MX-80 with Graf- 
trax Plus. When using PFS.File I would like to 
be able to set the right and left margins and page 
lengths to skip the perforadons. Also, the PFS 
manual suggests the control -O command to get 
a 132-column printout. When I use it, I get a 
compressed code with an eighty-column print 
line length, not 132. Any suggestions? 
Alan Smolen, Palm Coast, FL 

The President's New Carpet 

My name is Norm Kams and I am the president 
of a new software company called Newport 
Software. I am sixteen years old and would like 
to make a few comments. 

I would like to give my thanks to Bert 
Kersey of Beagle Bros. I have learned a lot from 
the disks I have bought from this company and 
also from the excellent documentation that 
comes with the company's disks. I have called 
Bert with problems or questions and have 
always been treated like a friend. He was very 
helpful in all cases. If you're out there, Bert, 
thanks a million! 

Another company that's been one of my fa- 
vorites is Penguin Software. They have the 
greatest utilities I have ever used. What's more, 
like Beagle Bros, they're listable, "leam-from- 
able," and usable in my own programs. Thanks 
for the help! 

One problem has been weighing me down. 



When I first got my computer, new carpet was 
being installed, and in the process of moving the I 
computer into the garage, my Epson MX-100 
manual got lost in the hustle and bustle. I have 
written to one of the company's distributors and 
have gotten no reply. I would very much ap- 
preciate another copy of the manual or informa- 
tion about where I can send for it.

Borderline Case 

I've got an Epson MX-80 that I've added some 
graphics chips to. I've also got version 2.0 of 
Apple PIE, a much beloved word processor. 
How can I suppress carriage returns from 
within PIE, thus overprinting on one line? 
Control-K, when input through the control- 
shift-M mode, doesn't do the job. Does 
anybody put out an Epson fact sheet for PIE? 

Would somebody please show me how to 
use MicroLisp! I even bought a Lisp book and 
typed in a program. The only thing blanker than 
the screen was the look on the local salesman's 
face when I asked about Lisp. 

I'd like to add conrniunication capability to 
my Apple but I don't want to pay an arm and a 
leg. I've got the chance to pick up a PDA serial 
card and a minimodem. How limited will my 
options be with this combination, and what can I 
expect to pay for just the basic software? Fur- 
ther, if I hook up to the Source, or the like, and 
tap into a database, I'd like to copy the infor- 
mation to text files (to be used by PIE) and read 
them later at my leisure. That will decrease my 
on-line time. Would I have to pay for the whole 
hour or do I just pay for the portion of the hour 
that I was on-line?

Uncode Him and Modem 

Recently, I was looking in my Applesoft man- 
ual, and I saw, on page 138, the ASCII charac- 
ter codes. As I was looking through it, I noticed 
that the characters are all in abbreviations. 
Could anyone please tell me what they stand 
for? Also, I was thinking about getting a 
modem. Can any readers suggest a good one to 
consider? 

David V. Luzi, Lapeer, MI 
Number, Please 

We want to use a modem and an Apple II Plus 
to divert incoming calls from an office to our 
home telephone during off-hours. There will be 
two lines in the office, one for incoming calls 
and one to call home (lines 1 and 2). The 
modem will be under control of a driver pro- 
gram that I will write in Basic or 6502 code. I 
wish to use certain functions of the modem 
under control of this driver program. 

The modem will have to recognize when a 
phone is ringing on line 1 and turn control over 
to the driver program without answering the 
call. This program would then switch the mo- 
dem to line 2 and dial our home phone number. 
After this the modem would return control to 
the driver program to connect together lines 1 
and 2, so the caller could talk to us at home. My

own hardware and program would do the 
switching between lines 1 and 2. It must be pos- 
sible for the system to recognize when either or 
both parties have hung up. This could be done 
by recognition of the dial tone when it returns 
after the conversation has ended. The system 
should then again be ready to accept other in- 
coming calls in the same fashion, and the whole 
operation must be able to occur without any 
human help. 

I would like to know if anyone has done this 
and how?

Beginner's Intrigue 

I was first introduced to the Apple last summer 
when I visited a friend in New York. Ever since 
then I've been intrigued, trying to learn as much 
as I can about Apples. Sojialk really helps— all 
the articles are informative and useful. May I 
suggest that you include an article on ways to 
copy-protect disks that's simple and can be un- 
derstood by us beginners. Also, an article on 
RAM cards and how to use them in programs 
would be nice. I recently bought a RAM card so 
I can use Pascal and Logo, but I have no idea 
how to access it through any of my programs. 
Chuck Lawson, Soquel, CA 

Hi and Dry 

I have been reading Sojialk for almost a year 
and find it offers lots of information on all sorts 
of neat stuff. After looking at all the software 
ads and reviews, I still haven't found any soft- 
ware for a Hipad. Hipad? What's a Hipad? 
Well, a Hipad is a Houston Instrument (HI) 
digitizer (pad). I think it is the best digitizer on 
the market. The only problem is that all of the 
good graphics software seems to be made for 
the Apple Graphics Tablet. I am looking for 
something similar to Special Effects and The 
Complete Graphics System II from Penguin 
Software. 

If the Apple Graphics Tablet were a better 
product I would have bought it. The fact is, Hi- 
pad is the best. How do you go about telling a 
software house that there is more than one digit- 
izer on the market? Is it possible, or am I wish- 
ing for too much? Aloha niu loa (thank you very 
much).

Let It Mock 

Not able to pass up a solicitation from Call 
-A.P.P.L.E. to obtain the opportunity to add 
sound effects and voice capabilities to my Apple 
n Plus, I recently purchased the Sound/Speech I 
Mockingboard, Penguin's Thunderbombs , and 
Synergistic Software's Microbe. The Mock- 
ingboard worked superbly with both products. 
It also worked in a superior fashion with the 
demo disks that Sweet Micro Systems, the 
manufacturer, provided. 

Programming the Mockingboard to add 
voice and sound to my Applesoft Basic pro- 
grams has been an exercise in frustration for 
me, however. Either the instruction manual was 
written solely for people with a background in 
assembly language, or I've flat missed a key 
paragraph or two in the manual. My program- 
ming skills are limited to Applesoft Basic . I would 
greatly appreciate any assistance Sojialk readers 



could provide that would explain exactly how I 
can use Basic to get my Mockingboard to speak. 
Also, how do I add some of the demo disk 
sounds to my Basic programs?

Housing Problems 

Have any readers out there in Appleland re- 
moved their Disk II drives from the original 
housings? If so, maybe they can help with my 
dilemma. I have a couple of construction proj- 
ects that need a housing and it sure would be 
nice to have them match my disk drives, since 
they will sit next to them. The problem is that 
I've been unable to locate a source for the 
things. I want the entire cream-colored part of 
the box, and there must be no added holes or 



damaged paint. If you have one, or know where 
I can get one, write to Open Discussion.

Shields Up 

When I purchased my Apple II Plus it was just 
prior to the shielding of such units. At that time 
it presented no problem. My Apple, however, 
is currently located in such an area that it 
disrupts television viewing throughout the en- 
tire household. 

After I wrote to the Apple organization 
several times without a satisfactory response, 
the people there finally instructed me to visit my 
nearest Apple dealer and inquire into a 
modification kit. That closest dealer quoted me 
a price twice the price Apple suggested. I then

How Do You Spell Release? 

In the May Mind Your Business there was a let- 
ter from Harding Rees on how to keep Epson 




tractor teeth from tearing up the paper. While 
he may be right about the paper guide pressure, 
a far more common cause of this problem is the 
friction feed mechanism. If the release lever is 
not in the release position, after a few sheets the 
paper will wander, causing the tractor teeth to 
jump out of the holes and chew up the paper. 
Better original alignment of the paper will allow 
more sheets to be printed before this happens 
but can never completely overcome it. The only 
solution for continuous-feed forms is to release 
the release lever.

Can't Get off the Ground 

I have been creating a roster for my U.S. Air 
Force Pilot Training Class and our association 
for the past ten years. I have been doing this 
manually with my electric typewriter and hours 
and hours of typing and updating. 

I recently purchased an Apple Tie with an 
eighty -column card, two disk drives, and an Ep- 
son MX- 100 III printer. I would like to pur- 
chase a software program that would allow me 
to duplicate the roster, along with its affiliated 
mailing labels, formatted with four names listed 
across alphabetically. Four across simplifies the 
cutting and pasting of the final print copy for 
reproduction, which is, typically, 500 copies. 



This will also allow me to utilize four-across 
mailing labels to send the finished product. 

I'd appreciate suggestions from readers 
about software programs that would help me 
with this roster.

struction as opposed to traditional methods of 
teaching writing skills. 

Some questions I am seeking answers to 
are: Is it cost effective? How extensive will 
teacher training have to be? Is there any infor- 
mation available that supports the use of com- 
puters in the teaching of writing skills? What 
are some possible sources of funding for 
research in this area?

I wrote an Applesoft 
program that does di- 
rect access reads to disk using PRINT 
CHR$(13) + CHR$(4) + "READ FILE.NAME, 
R";X where x is the record number, followed 
by an input statement. After each read, I usually 
print a report line on my printer (a Microline 
83A behind a serial 1200 baud CCS. 7710A 
interface card). All of this seems to be working 
fine until I put in program logic to exclude from 
printing some of the disk records— at which 
time I get a blank line printed for each disk 
record read, examined, and skipped. It sure 
makes a funny-looking report. 

I have tried several things to eliminate this 
"feature." I took out the CHR$(13) but DOS 
began to act strange. I tried a PR#0 before the 
disk read and a PR#1 after. I played around 
with semicolons at the end of each print state- 
ment. Any constructive suggestions would be 
appreciated. Michael R. Bishop, Shreveport, LA 




TH£H 



Your taking out the 
CHR$(13) was a step in 
the right direction. To make DOS stop acting 
strange, try a print statement after any get state- 
ments or print statements that end with a semi- 
colon. DOS doesn't need the print CHR$(13) 
immediately before its commands. It just needs 
a line feed to have been printed after all previ- 
ous statements. This can be acccomplished by 
ending print statements with a semicolon and 
using input instead of get. Reading and printing 
at the same time can be tricky— you might try to 
separate the two functions. David Durkee 

If there is any way to 
call the Monitor move 
routine from Basic, I'd sure like to know what it 
is. Bruce Hahne, Iowa City, I A 




^f^^^ Yes, it is possible to use 
I the Monitor move rou- 
tine from Basic with a routine invented by S. H. 
Lam a number of years ago. It requires that you 
poke the Monitor command into the input buffer 
and then call the Monitor input routine. A typi- 
cal memory move might look like this: 

10 C$ = " 401^400.7FEM N D823G": 
FOR I = 1 TO LEN (C$): POKE 511 
+ I, ASC ( MID$ (C$,l,1)) + 128: 
NEXT : POKE 72,0: CALL - 144 

Try it, you'll like it! Another solution to this 
problem appears in the Ilnd Grade Chats arti- 
cles in this issue and last month's. Doug 
Carlston 



If I plot a two-dimen- 
sional figure, such as 
a square, is it possible to have the Apple fill it in 
with a simple command? Stuart Duncan, Her- 
shey, PA 



THiH 



There is no fill routine 
built into the Apple. To 
have your program automatically fill an area, 
you'll have to either write your own fill routine 
or use one of several available from published 
software packages. (The February 1983 issue of 
Softalk had an assembly language fill routine 
listed in Graphically Speaking that might be 
helpful.) Mark Pelczarski 

I typed in the Font Edi- 
tor that appeared in a 
previous issue of Softalk (The Third Basic, 
February '83) and I have a problem. If I save a 
font to disk, the type comes up UNKNWN in- 
stead of FONT. The size is 1,024 characters. 
What's the solution? Julian LeRoi Altenhaus, 
Maplewood, NJ 




Your disk file is un- 
doubtedly a FONT file; 
it just isn't called that. The file type is deter- 
mined by the value of a single byte in the file's 
directory listing. Business Basic, unfortunately, 
has no way of assigning the proper FONT file 
code number or of changing die file type desig- 
nation once it has been made. On the other 
hand, if you have Pascal you can change the file 
type designation easily with the Pascal Filer's 
Alter command. The file type can also be 
reassigned from assembly language by issuing a 
SET-FILE-INFO SOS call. John Jeppson 




When I use the expres- 
sion X = fre (0) in a 
program, the execution gets delayed for several 
seconds or more when I'm loading a text file. 
There can be a huge program in memory with 
lots of data, but only if the data is being read 
from a text file does this cause a delay. Why is 
this? Can it be avoided? A. loannides, Ossining, 
NY 



mN 



This will get a little tech- 
nical, so hold on to your 
hat. First of all, the X = fre (0) command in 
Applesoft does two things. It tells you how 
much free memory there is in the computer, and 
it does something called garbage collecting, 
which is Applesoft's way of making sure that all 
the possible available memory is counted. All 
this relates to the way variables are stored in 
memory. Numeric variables are very orderly; 
they pretty much stay in one place. Because in- 
teger and floating point variables always use 
seven bytes each, this works out all right. When 
the value of the variable changes, the new value 
can go into the same place as the old value. 

A string, however, can be any length from 0 
to 255 characters, plus seven bytes for the 
pointer. If we used the same system for string 
variables as for numeric ones, the system would 
break down quickly. Whenever a five-byte 
string was replaced with a ten-byte string, the 
next string would be overwritten. For this 



OCTOBER 1983 



57 



reason, only the string pointers are stored along 
with the other variables. The strings are stored 
immediately beneath the location pointed to by 
himem. Each time a string changes, the new 
string is placed in memory immediately below 
the last one stored. The old one isn't erased, but 
the pointer for that variable now points at the 
new string. 

If you have a program in which strings are 
constantly changing in value, a lot of memory is 
used up fast, mostly with old strings. The proc- 
ess we call garbage collection looks through all 
the strings and decides which ones are currently 
being used and which can be deleted. Fre (0) 
forces this activity, so if there is a lot of garbage 
in memory when the command is executed, it 
can naturally take some time to sort through 
it all. 

Back to the question at hand. There are a 
couple of ways to read strings from a text file. If 
the file contains just a list of words, the input 
statement works fine. If, for instance, you're 
reading text that was created on a word proces- 
sor, you'll discover that the presence of com- 
mas and returns in the text confuses the input 
command. Consequently, a lot of people use the 
get statement to read the file, one character at a 
time, and put the characters into strings accord- 
ing to the special needs of their particular pro- 
grams. This sounds like what's happening in 
your program. This type of input creates a lot of 
garbage strings. Just reading the word "Apple" 
in this way creates the strings A, p, Ap, p, App, 
1, Appl, e, and Apple. Reading data statements 
wouldn't do the same thing because the string is 
read all at once instead of one character at a 
time. 

Although there may be a solution, it prob- 
ably isn't an easy one. If you are willing to dive 
into DOS, you could write a routine to load a 
text fde directly into memory as if it were a bi- 
nary file. If you want to deal with the data from 
Applesoft, however, you still need some way to 
put it into string form. An easier way would be 
to write the input routine that reads the text file 
one character at a time in machine language in- 
stead of Applesoft. In that way, you get around 
saving all the preliminary forms of the final 
string. To do this, you will need to study how 
strings are stored in memory. Start with Appen- 
dix I in the Applesoft reference manual. David 
Durkee 




I have been trying to 
learn more about the as- 
sembly and use of shape tables. I understand the 
use of such things as the draw, xdraw, and rot 
statements, and I am beginning to understand 
how to unwrap vectors and encode them. My 
problem is I am having trouble assembling the 
shape table directory. Also, if someone could 
help me figure out how to poke a table in from 
Applesoft I'd really be grateful. Andy Ihnatko, 
Westwood, MA 



WiH 



If you've got the actual 
shape definitions down, 
you've managed the difficult part. The shape 
directory at the beginning of the shape table is 
relatively easy. Each value stored takes two 
bytes, although in reverse order. For example, 
suppose you have three shapes in your table. 



The first two bytes tell the number of shapes. 
They are stored as 03 00, which really means 
0003. The next three pairs of bytes give the off- 
set, from the beginning of the table, of each of 
the three shapes. If the pair 03 00 is called bytes 
0 and 1 of the table, bytes 2 and 3 hold the offset 
to the first shape, bytes 4 and 5 hold the offset to 
the second shape, and bytes 6 and 7 hold the off- 
set to the third shape. This means that you can 
start the actual shape definition of shape 1 at 
byte number 8. Its offset would then be 0008 
and stored as 08 00. So now the first four bytes 
of the shape directory are 03 00 08 00. Each of 
the next two pairs of offsets depends on the 
length of the shapes in between. If shape 1 takes 
twenty-one bytes, then the offset to shape 2 
would be 0008 -I- 0021, or 0029. Stored in 
reverse order, they'd be 29 00. Now, to throw 
you off slightly and remind you that this is hex- 
adecimal, if shape 2 is 1D3 bytes long, the off- 
set to shape 3 is 0029 -I- 01D3, or OlFC, stored 



as FC 01. So in this fictitious example, the 
shape directory is 03 00 08 00 29 00 FC 01 . 
You'd put your actual shape definitions imme- 
diately after this. 

About poking the table in from Applesoft: 
First you have to take all those ugly hex- 
adecimal numbers and convert them to base 10. 
Here are the equivalences: 

Hex 0123456789ABCDE F 
BaselO 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1112 13 14 15 

The left digit in a two-digit hex number is the 
number of sixteens, so hexadecimal 23 is 2 * 16 
-h 3 = 32 -I- 3 = 35 in base 10. Another exam- 
ple: Hexadecimal C5 = 12 * 16 + 5 = 192 -I- 
5 = 197 in base 10. If you don't want to do 
these conversions by hand, there's a program 
for number base conversion in this month's 
Basic Solution. 

Once you convert all the values in your 
shape table to base 10, you can poke them into

sequential locations in memory. There are 
about 200 free bytes starting at location 768 
(which is hexadecimal $300, or 3 * 256 + 0 * 
16 + 0). The $ is the standard abbreviation for 
hexadecimal, although, with inflation, in a few 
years it will probably stand for base 15. (Ignore 
that last comment— just kidding.) The last thing 
you must do before you use the shape table, 
though, is poke locations 232 and 233 with the 
location of the beginning of the shape table, 
again in reverse order. So starting location 0300 
is poked as 00 03, or: 

POKE 232,0 : POKE 233,3 

Now this should work okay. As you can see, 
shape tables, as they come now on the Apple, 
aren't exactly for the first-time user. Some good 
programs for getting started with graphics are

ware or a new one written by David Shapiro 
called Amper-Graphics. Mark Pelczarski 

I need to speed up the 
computer system I have 
written for my medical office. The entire 
system is written in Apple III Business Basic 
and does everything I want it to, but it is slow at 
data production when we run the billing. I need 
some invokable modules; but my problem is 
that string locations in Basic are a secret. I real- 
ize they move, but I feel the speed would be en- 
hanced if I could get to the string data in assem- 
bly language. I also realize that you can't extend 
a Basic string. Raymond Sjerven, Kennewick, 
WA 



WIN 




Amazingly enough, there 
is actually a way to get 
at string data from a machine language module 
in Business Basic. And it's not too bad if you 
can get by with merely manipulating the exist- 
ing characters, including changing them to 
blanks. What really gets hairy is when you ac- 
tually want to change the legal length of the 
string. Changing the characters can be done "in 
place" in memory, but lengthening or shorten- 
ing the string results in the creation of a new 
string somewhere else in memory with the 
release of the old string to "free" memory. 
That, in turn, may lead to garbage collection 
and involve just about the entire interpreter. 

The more limited process of simple access to 
a string works as follows: Business Basic should 
already have created a string of the appropriate 
length in the usual manner. Then the address of 
the string is passed to the invokable module by 
the command PERFORM (@ mystring$). The 
address will be passed on the stack and also at 
$E8,9 on zero page, with the appropriate Xbyte 
at $16E9. This pointer, however, points to a 
' 'descriptor, ' ' not to the string itself. You now 
make use of what Apple calls the NOTNOW 
procedure, with the following declarations: 



INDEX 

DISPATCH 

NOTNOW 



.ECU 
.EQU 
.EQU 



35 
0E4 

13. (decimal) 



After popping and saving the return address, 
pop the descriptor address parameter directly to 
INDEX ($0E4,5). Then move the Xbyte from

$16E9 to INDEX -I- 1601. Next store 
#NOTNOW (decimal 13) at DISPATCH -I- 3 
and execute JSR DISPATCH. When the 
subroutine returns, the actual address of the 
string itself will be in INDEX and the string 
length in the accumulator. You can then handle 
the string by extended addressing off of IN- 
DEX. John Jeppson 

One of the best feamres 
offered by Basic on many 
large computers is the relative ease of matrix 
algebra applications. The lack of a fast means of 
manipulating arrays in Business Basic is a real 
limitation. I have managed to overcome this in 
machine langauge on my Apple n Plus. If one 
of the SoftaUc Sages has any suggestions, I'd ap- 
preciate the advice. David K. Magee, Jackson, 
MS 




men 



Business Basic could cer- 
tainly use a good set of 
matrix manipulation procedures in an invokable 
module. With your experience in dealing with 
machine language arrays on the Apple n Plus 
perhaps you would enjoy creating such a 
module on the Apple HI. You will, of course, 
need to use the Assembler from the Pascal 
system to create invokable modules for Busi- 
ness Basic. The Basic command PERFORM 
myprocedure (@ arrayvariable) will pass the 
address of your array to a machine language 
procedure in your invokable module. Two bytes 
of the address will be passed on the stack and 
also placed at $E8,9 on zero page. The appro- 
priate Xbyte will also be placed at location 
$16E9. To access the array data you must use 
extended addressing as described in the Pro- 
gram Preparation Tools manual that comes with 
the Pascal system. Array elements are two bytes 
for integers, four for reals, and eight for long 
integers; all such arrays are sequentially organ- 
ized in memory. John Jeppson 




Is it possible to get 
around having only 64K 
available for string arrays in Business Basic? 
These limits to what one can manipulate in 
memory are frustrating, and the fact that all that 
memory is sitting there unused is devastating! 
Harold Drob, San Francisco, CA 



wen 



The 64K limitation on 
string arrays arises from 
the manner in which strings are stored and ac- 
cessed in Apple HI Basic. The location of each 
string is kept in a table, but the location number 
actually stored is an offset from the beginning 
of the string data area in memory. Each time a 
string is accessed, the offset must be subtracted 
from the base address of the string pool to find 
the actual address of the string. With an offset 
of two bytes (sixteen bits), the largest number 
of separate locations that can be specified is 
64K. If the writers of Business Basic had chosen 
to make the offset three bytes long instead of 
two, much larger arrays would have been pos- 
sible. But subtracting a three-byte offset from a 
three-byte base address would take a lot longer 
and would slow access for every string. The 
writers apparently chose speed over maximum 
size. John Jeppson

One person might play with it awhile and say, 
"Jeepers! It's such a great idea, why didn't anyone 
think of it before?" 

Another might say, "Who needs something like 
this, anyway?" 

In answer to the second observer: Who needs a col- 
or television? Who needs a microwave oven? Who 
needs a computer? Answer: nobody. They're just nifty 
things to have. 

And that's why Beagle Bros makes the programs it 
does— because they're nifty things to have. Not 
wonderful, not nice, but nifty. 

To understand why Beagle Bros publishes pro- 
grams like DOS Boss, Utility City, and Apple Me- 
chanic, you have to understand Bert Kersey. And 
that's no small job. 

How do you understand a man who has three 
clocks on his wall, showing the time in three different 
cities— San Diego, Fresno, and Seattle— all, of course, 
showing the same time ("If anything changes in those 
cities, we'll know about it")? 

How do you understand a man who puts interna- 
tional symbols on the back of his disk envelopes telling 
you not to set disks on fire, feed disks to a crocodile, 
put disks in a toaster, fly disks like kites, or use disks

to hold toilet tissue? 

And how do you understand a man who puts trouser legs and shoes on 
the legs of his bed table? 

You don't. People like Kersey are dangerous and should be 
avoided— unless you happen to own a computer. In that case, they're 
people we should be grateful for. 

In its short three-year existence. Beagle Bros has made our Apples do 
tricks we didn't know were possible and made us laugh at things we 
didn't know were funny. Anyone who has ever seen a Beagle Bros ad, 
manual, or Tip Book knows what Kersey does in his spare time: He 
works full-time finding out things we didn't know we wanted to know. 

Neither he nor his wife Sharon will let on whether it's really their 
beagle Sophie who writes all the software and documentation, and 



Sophie can't speak for herself (she's shy). 

It may well be that Kersey (or Sophie) is the world's first software 
satirist. But he's not as nutty as he seems. 

Is It Chips Yet? As a young man, Bert Kersey spent most of his life 
waiting for someone to invent the microcomputer. Contrary to what one 
might believe, he didn't spend all that time writing utilities for the com- 
puter that would be invented some twenty years later. 

He was into r/z/«^5— electric trains, erector sets, gadgets, and wid- 
gets. The electric trains were his biggest passion. Even today, the 
molding in one of the hallways of his house is lined with trains on an oval 
track. 

When it came time for college. Kersey took his trains with him to San 
Diego State University— if not physically, then at least in his heart. It

Opposite page: When asked why he wanted to get into the software business, Bert Kersey replies, "I'm not sure." The rest is history. This page (top 
row): Sharon Kersey says that, although she and Bert do a lot of the paperwork, it was a troop of her nieces who chipped, cracked, and broke their 
fingernails stuffing plastic bags with disks and manuals in the earlier days; Sophie does her part for Beagle Bros by taking everyone's naps for them; if 
Tom Weishaar ever starts his own software company, he'll begin with half of what he'll need— a company shirt. Bottom row: Convinced that DOS Boss 
has put him in the public eye. Jack Cassidy goes outside only if he's wearing a disguise; in this middle picture, he models his latest disguise; Mark 
Simonsen ("I'm just a normal guy. Huh? Yes, I work for Beagle Bros, but I'm not real crazy or anything. What's that? Look, I just help them with the 
phones and program for them, okay? No, I don't want to say anything funny, so leave me alone before I call a cop!"). 



was the trains that influenced his decision in selecting a major. 

"I saw the word 'engineering' in 'electrical engineering,' and that's 
how I decided," Kersey says. Unfortunately, electrical engineering isn't 
a major that prepares people to drive electric trains; it prepares them for 
solving differential equations and staying up late at night. Grinding it out 
with electrical engineers didn't seem to agree with Kersey (he liked to 
sleep). So he soon switched to graphic arts, where he stayed for the rest 
of his college days. 

After graduating, Kersey spent four years designing and putting to- 
gether menus, signs, annual reports, and brochures for a restaurant com- 
pany before deciding to solo as a free-lance artist. 

When he wasn't at the drawing table, Kersey was off making movies. 
One of his movies that he especially remembers was a surfing film called 



Seaweed Sandwich. Though it sounds like something that would be 
shown on channel 17.5 at 4:00 a.m., the movie was originally made with 
profit in mind. Kersey's idea was to put together a montage of beach 
scenes, comprising a ninety-minute movie that would play at colleges 
and make a few bucks in the process. 

"It should have been just twenty minutes long; it played twice and 
flopped," he recalls. 

Seaweed Sandwich wasn't Kersey's only cinematic project. His other 
works include dozens of home movies, which went far beyond the usual 
relatives celebrating birthday parties. In fact, it's Kersey's experience in 
shooting and editing films that he credits for the way most of his Apple 
utility programs look on-screen. 

Risky Business. Sharon Kersey wasn't exacdy thrilled with her hus-

OCTOBER 1983 



band's filmic endeavors. Because of her conservative upbringing, 
Sharon found it hard to accept Kersey's quitting his job and their moving 
to the beach for something that showed little promise. 

"I'm glad we did it, though," she admits. "Even though it wasn't a 
practical decision, it was a challenge to take the risk; and if you don't 
take risks like that once in a while, life gets boring. 

"It's more interesting to live in such a way that there's always 
new things happening," she says. "You don't know what's around 
the comer." 

What was around the corner m 1979, however, almost exceed- 
ed Sharon's limits of "taking risks." That's when Bert discovered 
computers. 

It was a Radio Shack TRS-80, and he wanted one. Badly. In typical 
fashion, he thought up almost every practical reason for having one: to 
do home finances, to do word processing, to monitor the house lights, to 
de-flea Sophie. In the final analysis. Kersey quit lying to himself and ad- 
mitted the real reason he wanted one— just because. 

Again Sharon expressed apprehension; to her, it just seemed like an- 
other expensive toy. And soon Bert also had misgivings about buying it. 

"Darned thing broke down three times in two weeks," he recalls. "I 




got my $600 back and bought an Apple." 

Two days is usually the length of time it takes most people to become 
familiar with a new Apple. Two days is the length of time it took Kersey 
to decide to quit working as a free-lance artist and to start a mail-order 
software business. 

Before going any further, he needed a name for his busmess. 

Why Not Apple? "All the names with soft, data, and micro were al- 
ready taken," says Kersey. "Besides, I wanted a name that people 
would remember. One of the things that popped into my mind was Walt 
Disney's Beagle Boys from the Scrooge McDuck comics, so I chose 
diat." 

The Disney company, however, has a habit of suing people who in- 
fringe, steal, or otherwise use its trademarks. Kersey had to find his 
company another name. That didn't pose much of a problem, even 
though he had already designed a Beagle Boys logo. 

"I just changed b-o-)'-s to b-r-o-s and I had a company." 

For Apple users who have made the scene after DOS Boss appeared. 



it should be noted that Kersey — whose name is now almost synonymous 
with utilities — wasn't always into that sector of the software market. 
Games was the area where Kersey concentrated his early programming 
efforts. It only seemed like the natural thing to do; he liked playing 
games, so he tried his hand at writing a few. 

"I didn't even know what a utility was in those days. I met Roger 
Wagner of Southwestern Data Systems and saw what a utility was. Utili- 
ties didn't look like much fun. The only other thing I knew about utilities 
was that people would call up Beagle Bros and ask if we had any." 

Following what he learned about the mail-order business. Kersey 
placed an ad in Creative Computing for some of the games he had writ- 
ten. The ad carried the same lighthearted tone characteristic of the ads 
Beagle Bros runs today. (Asked which he likes more, writing programs 
or writing the manuals. Kersey replies, "Writing the ads.") 

Kersey didn't know the Apple software market too well in those days. 
His system consisted of an Integer Basic Apple II and a cassette player, 
and he assumed everyone else's did too. After all, who in their right 
minds would opt for something called "Applesoft" and spend $600 on a 
disk drive? Ridiculous. 

When orders started coming in, most customers requested Applesoft 
versions— on disk. That meant endless hours at the keyboard, converting 
the games from Integer to Applesoft and then putting them on floppies. 
Things only got worse when mail orders requested programs in some 
new thing called DOS 3.3. 

"Remember, I was locked in my room all day. I had no idea of what 
was going on out there," says Kersey. 

Bringing Home the Kibble. During the formative days of Beagle 
Bros, Sharon Kersey was the primary source of income for the family. 
About the time Bert was vying for an Academy Award with Seaweed 
Sandwich (he didn't win; the competition was a movie called Patton), 
Sharon had quit her job as a social worker with the county welfare 
department and started her own interior landscaping company. 

Either eight years in that business was long enough for Sharon or 
Beagle Bros was getting too big for one person to handle. She and Bert 
decided that it might be nice for them to work together on the same proj- 
ect for once. Having spent the previous thirteen years taking turns sup- 
porting one another, the two agreed to make Beagle Bros a husband-and- 
wife effort. 

Though Sharon handles most of the administrative duties, Bert is still 
as busy as ever. A typical day is divided up among programming, writ- 
ing documentation, creating ads (he does all copy writing, typesetting, 
composition, and paste-up himself), and feeding Sophie, who claims to 
advise Bert when her steak is done. Kersey denies this. 

The Other Boss of DOS. Though the true Beagle Bros are Bert and 
Sharon Kersey, one of the original Bros was Jack Cassidy, coauthor of 
DOS Boss and Alpha Plot. 

The son of a Navy man, Cassidy spent the better part of his life 
following his father's military transfers around the country. With his 
roots in San Diego, Cassidy finally transplanted himself to Cornell 
University in Ithaca, New York. There he received his undergraduate 
degree in mathematics. Then he was set for a career in microcomputers, 
right? Wrong. 

For whatever reasons people want to become writers, Cassidy 
stepped in that direction by enrolling in graduate school to study creative 
writing. He went to the University of Colorado, Johns-Hopkins, and the 
University of California, Irvine. If there were a University of Port Hue- 
neme (his birthplace), he might have gone there too. His total number of 
years in graduate study? "About one," Cassidy says with a chuckle. 

"I had my share of problems in graduate school; nothing out of the 
ordinary— things like money." 

When he finally realized he wasn't cut out for the life of a graduate 
student, Cassidy returned to San Diego to do some serious work at 
S-Cubed as a nuclear reactor technician. 

But any dreams Cassidy had of becoming a future nuclear physicist 
were shattered when he met Kersey. 

The two were introduced by a mutual friend who knew about one 
man's love of his Apple and the other's expertise with computers. As 
Cassidy tells it, "Bert showed me his Apple, and I was amazed at all the 
stuff it could do. He let me borrow it, and it just blew my mind how this 
little teeny machine could do all these things my three-million-dollar 
computer at work couldn't do." 

Like what? "It could play music. The Apple could do graphics in-

stantly. For the computer we used at S-Cubed, you had to write algo- 
rithms, input them, wait, and then wait some more. A real hassle. With 
the Apple, you just type it in and it's there." 

Things began taking shape. A path began to wear between the Cassi- 
dy and Kersey residences, mostly in one direction. Jack continued to fool 
with Bert's computer, while Bert was putting together Game Pack #1. 

What do you do when your friend is hogging your computer all the 
time? Bert couldn't kick him off; after all, it was for the good of the com- 
pany. Solution: Kersey bought an Apple for Cassidy. 

It wasn't because Bert was just a swell kind of guy, but so Cassidy 
could do all his work at home. "That situation didn't last very long," 
says Cassidy. "The next day, I bought it from him." 

Found: One DOS, Near Main Ram; Does Tricks. About that time. 
Beagle Bros's Game Pack was selling well enough to make it worth the 
upstairs commute to work every morning. But then Kersey began fooling 
with disk drives. 

Kersey is a curious and inquiring man, always experimenting, trying 
to make his Apple do weird things. As most Apple hobbyists do every 
now and then, he would try out poking random values into random loca- 
tions, just to see the result. He even wrote a program that could print out 




The Beagle Bros general accounting system: Each disk sticker represents 
100 sales. Lots of stickers means business is good. No stickers means 
business is not good. 

the contents of the Apple's memory wherever it found ASCII characters. 
From this, he discovered a list of all DOS commands. 

"I remember Bert saying, 'Hey, this is funny. What's it all mean?' " 
says Cassidy. 

Then, one afternoon, for reasons that are unknown to this day. 
Kersey came out of his computer room and picked up a magazine. 

"I read that it was possible to change the way DOS commands are 
worded. " The two then sat down, changing DOS commands and poking 
in values at various locations, just to see what would happen. 

"Most of the time the computer would hang and we'd have to re- 
boot," says Kersey, "but about every fiftieth try or so, something in- 
teresting would happen. We'd look at it, smile, write it down, and 
continue." 

The completion of DOS Boss took about three months, a time during 
which Cassidy thought about quitting his job at the nuclear plant. In 
November 1981 , DOS Boss debuted at number three on the Softalk Hob- 
by 10, and Cassidy quit his job. 

Just a few months later, the two co-wrote Alpha Plot, a graphics and 
hi-res text utility, which hit the Hobby 10 in March 1982. That was 
Cassidy's last Beagle program. 

By then, things really began cooking. The company took up most of 
Kersey's time, and Cassidy realized there wasn't too much that he and 
Kersey could work on together; Kersey liked Basic, and Cassidy didn't. 



' 'Basic makes my back hurt, ' ' says Cassidy. ' 'I also have a bad mem- 
ory, and Basic always requires you to remember all those variables and 
line numbers. 

"Bert and I still toss around ideas of what we might do in the future. 
With Apple's ProDOS coming out, I'm sure I'll be doing a lot of modifi- 
cations to DOS Boss . " 

Cassidy is still his own man, doing free-lance work for other publish- 
ers. One of his programs is B-Fast, a B-tree programming utility for 
Pascal fans, which is being published by Datamost. Another is Mega- 
finder, a Pascal database management program from Megahaus. 

Roll Over, Sophie— Now! Whereas Cassidy takes to the "serious" 
programming languages for their aesthetic value. Kersey absolutely 
abhors them. When it comes to programming, he's too impatient to learn 
assembly language, which is strange for a person whose Tip Books are 
fiill of hints on how to make programs run faster and jump higher. 

Kersey avoids assembly for the same reason that he got out of the 
photography business — too much time is sjjent waiting. 

"In assembly language, you have to write your program, run it, 
debug it, reassemble, and run it again. It's like waiting for your prints to 
come back from the photo lab," he explains. "I like the way Basic lets j 
you make a change and see it immediately." 

With this attitude, Kersey plodded along in Applesoft, coming up 
with bestselling utilities like Utility City and Apple Mechanic. Utility City 
was a collection of twenty-one programs on one disk; Apple Mechanic 
contained ten utilities and several other tasty delights. 

Once in the hands of hobbyists, these wonders let users format Apple- 
soft listings, put invisible commands inside programs, format catalog 
listings, create tricky file names, create shape tables, customize type- 
faces, combine text with graphics, rewrite bytes on disk, and do just 
about anything else Kersey's mind could concoct and chum out. All in 
Applesoft, all unprotected, and all listable. 

Most Beagle Bros programs are meant to be teaching tools for Apple- 
soft programmers. In fact, several programs on Tip Disk §1 encourage 
the customer to list the program before running it to see what makes it 
tick. This is extremely helpful when you run into one of Kersey's devil- 
ish ditties, the sole purpose of which is to baffle and confuse. 

Beagle Bros programs have been unprotected from day one, and 
piracy has had little to do with that decision. 

"Protecting software is a waste of time," says Kersey. "Copy- 
protection schemes that work today are just going to be broken next 
month, and the whole process of developing schemes takes too long. 

"Besides, none of us knows how to do it." 

Neither the Experienced nor Inexperienced Need Apply. If that 
last remark prompts potential protection scheme writers to apply for a 
job with Beagle Bros, forget it. Other than Bert and Sharon Kersey, the 
company has never had any full-time employees, and it's been happy that 
way. Things are changing now, though; Beagle Bros's growth is becom- 
ing too much for the Kerseys to handle. 

' 'We're actually considering taking on employees to help with a lot of 
the paperwork," says Sharon. 

Kristen Schwartz, Bert's niece, is probably the closest thing they 
have that resembles an employee. Under the Beagle alias of Minnie 
Assembler, Kristen is the one who handles all the company's mail corre- 
spondence. Customers might notice that, on product registration 
cards, the Beagle mail department is said to be headed by Flo Chart. 
"That," Kristen points out, "is a lie. Flo is nothing more than a woman 
on a poster in the Beagle office whose belly button lights up at two-sec- 
ond intervals." 

The only other semiemployee is Mark Simo.isen, creator of Flex Text 
and Double-Take. When he's not trying to think up new ways to use his 
programming skills to impress Kersey enough to give him a raise, Simon- 
sen is the person you talk to when you phone the company. Whether it's 
a technical question or one about submitting programs for possible 
publication, he's the one who saves Kersey the trouble of picking up the 
phone and saying, "Gee, I dunno. Phone Apple and ask for Steve." 

Like the way Kersey waited for computers to be invented, Simonsen 
waited for a company like Beagle Bros to be founded. After receiving his 
bachelor's degree in computer science from Brigham Young University, 
Simonsen jumped right into the working world, nabbing a job at GTE. 
Writing telecommunications software is a far cry from creating pro- 
grams that let your Basic listings scroll up and down, but it paid well and 
offered nice benefits. i

SOPTAI 1^ 



OCTOBER 1983 



Apples were nothing new to Simonsen, who had used them extensive- 
ly at BYU since 1978. In October 1981, he bought his own Apple, with 
the idea in mind of writing programs for publication. 

I Can Do That. "My first idea was to write a superduper DOS pro- 
gram that would allow you to modify DOS commands and messages to 
be what you wanted them to be. Then I found out about a program called 
DOS Boss that already did that," Simonsen remembers. 

"Next, I saw On-Line's SuperScribe (Screen Writer II) word proc- 
essor and how it let you format your text in various column widths; I 
wanted to do something like that for Basic programs." 

Simonsen contacted Sierra On-Line and submitted his program. He 
and the Coarsegold publisher corresponded several times before his pro- 
gram was rejected. Then Simonsen contacted Sharon Kersey, who sug- 
gested that he submit a demo of his program, along with documentation. 

"I wasn't ready at all. I said, 'Fine,' and hurried to write the docu- 
mentation, since there wasn't any." 

Now, he needed a demonstration program. Anxious to impress his 
potential publisher, Simonsen borrowed a copy of DOS Boss from a 
friend, looked at the demo, examined the program listing, and tried to 
write one that carried the same Beagle flavor. It worked. 




"One of the things that caught Bert's eye right away was my demo 
program. He told me facetiously that he wished he could write demo pro- 
grams as well." 

With that. Flex Text was bom, taking its place on the Hobby 10 after 
only one month on the market. 

About the same time Kersey was chuckling over Simonsen's Flex 
Text demo, Tom Weishaar — as the latest Beagle Bros Bulletin puts it, 
"That's pronounced, 'Weishaar' "—was signed up as another Beagle 
contributor. 

While the path Kersey took to the computer business was a con- 
voluted one, Weishaar's was even more circuitous. He went to India 
first. 

Don't Shoot Me; I've Got Programs To Write. In the late sixties. 
Uncle Sam was yanking kids by the ear to serve time in Vietnam. Wei- 
shaar, a man quite fond of his ears as well as the rest of his body, applied 
to the Peace Corps. 

Not too long after that, he found out that the Army wasn't interested 
in his ears and he wouldn't have to go. That bit of news had him so happy 
that he totally forgot his pending application to the Peace Corps. 



"Right about then I was jilted by this girl I was seeing, and when the 
Peace Corps called and asked if I'd like to go to India for a few years, I 
said, 'Heck yes!' " 

Originally sent there to teach modem agriculture techniques to Indian 
farmers, Weishaar found those two years to be an invaluable experience 
he'd recommend to everyone. 

"One-third of my life was growing up and going to college. Another 
third was two years in the Peace Corps. And another third was eve- 
rything I've done since then." i 

Weishaar's background seems hardly a foundation for a life in micro- 
computers: a bachelor's degree in English, radio, television, and film 
from the University of Iowa; the Peace Corps; his years spent working in 
his father's farm-equipment business; a master's degree in joumalism 
from the University of Kansas; a stint at the Commodities News Service, > 
a wire service for farmers, where he was the editor of Cotton Trade 
News. Though his interest in computing stemmed from his hand in the 
videotex industry, Weishaar's primary reason for getting a computer was 
similar to Kersey's. 

"Some people buy speed boats, some buy campers; I wanted a 
computer." 

The system Weishaar started with was a 16K Integer Apple and a 
modem. No disk drive, no monitor, no printer; it was planned that way 
for quite some time. 

"When we bought our house, I designated the dining room as the 
future computer room. So, for eighteen months, the dining room didn't 
have a piece of furniture in it." 

Some people make room for babies, and others . . . well, the Wei- 
shaars are just that kind of family. 

After learning Basic and assembly language on his own, Weishaar 
wrote Frame-Up and knew just who he wanted to publish it. 

"I examined my own philosophies about the software industry and 
looked for a company whose philosophies matched. I liked Beagle Bros's 
ads, and their sense of humor was much like my own," says Weishaar. 
"We also both feel strongly about keeping software inexpensive and 
unprotected." 

He concedes that "piracy is a big problem that is killing the indus- 
try," but that "protection schemes aren't the answer." 

No Bad Dogs, the Beagle Way. If there is an answer to solving the 
piracy problem. Beagle Bros seems to know the general area in which 
it's buried. Despite their lack of protection schemes. Beagle programs 
continue to sell. In the September Softalk Top Thirty, Beagle Bros placed 
five titles. In the Hobby 10 category, it held seven slots. (Kersey points 
out that with such a saturation of Beagle utilities, the category should be 
changed to Utility 10.) 

Even Beagle Bag, a collection of twelve games from the early Kersey 
era, broke into the Arcade 10 in August. "It can't really be classified as 
an arcade game, but where else could you put it?" quips the games' 
author. 

There seems to be a pattem developing here: low prices, unprotected 
disks, good quality, tmst in consumers, and amusing manuals. This is 
just part of what kept DOS Boss on the bestseller charts for twenty-one 
of the past twenty -three months. 

The pattern continues. Beagle Bros has acquired Global Program 
Line Editor (GPLE) from Synergistic Software and is now publishing the 
already bestselling utility. Unprotected and at a lower price. 

None of the Beagle programmers have any permanent bonds to the 
company, but they do have things in the works. 

Cassidy's current project is a book that will contain answers to 
popular adventure games, including Time Zone. "People can read the 
book to find out how the adventure turns out, thus saving them countless 
hours at the keyboard," he jokes. "The Time Zone solution will be on 
six double-sided pages." The book will be published by Datamost. 

Not to be outdone, Weishaar is currently working on a book for 
beginners. "No programming. Just simple stuff like how to use Fid, how 
to back up files, and how to press keys." 

When he's not on the phone telling people how to get warm root beer 
off their Flex Text disks, Simonsen is working on a graphics disk for 
Beagle Bros. 

In a fast-growing software industry that claims to be busting out of 
the cottage and heading for the glass-and-steel skyscrapers. Beagle Bros 
is thumbing its nose at that attitude by keeping things small. And fun. 

Especially fun.

The Schoolhouse Apple 

by Jock Root 




We talk about computer literacy a lot. We praise it as a shining goal 
and rebuke ourselves for not having enough of it. Some of us think that 
being computer-literate is the answer to sodety's problems; others con- 
sider it a necessary attribute of any civilized person— like being able to 
dial a telephone (remember dial telephones?) or drive a car (remember 
shifting gears?). Wonderful stuff, this computer literacy; but what exact- 
ly is it? 

An earlier generation (less than ten years ago) called it "computer 
awareness"— the generation before that would have called it "computer 
hipness" if they'd known about it. The general idea is computer 
familiarity— being comfortable around a computer and capable of using 
it as a tool. 

A curious thing about that phrase, "computer literacy." It has the 
ring of an outsider's label. Somehow it's a term you apply to "them," 
not to "us." If you're a computer-literate person yourself, you probably 
don't think in terms of "literacy" (except, maybe, in talking to out- 
siders). If you think about it at all, you think of it as understanding or 
skills. 

Consider this phrase from the viewpoint of the victim— the one who 
is to be stuffed with computer literacy. You can imagine teachers sitting 
still for it, because they think it's their duty; but a kid will say, 
"Literacy? No way! I'd rather play Zaxco/i!" 

But when you offer a child understanding (say, "how to work the 
computer"), or even just familiarity (say, "You want to try it?"), you'll 
probably get a different response. After all, children are very practical; 
and understanding is something you can use while literacy is only 
something other people see when they look at you. 

This concept of computer familiarity could be expressed as being able 
to talk to the computer in its own language— or one of them anyway. The 
nice thing is, a computer can speak many languages, from Pascal and 
Fortran (obscure) to Basic (fairly simple) and the control language of 
your favorite word processor, game, or whatever (probably complex, 
but human-oriented). Being able to understand any one of these 
languages would qualify you as being comfortable with computers, 
which is what it's all about. 

So maybe we should call it "computer fluency." 

Kidstun^. A new book, Anna Mae Walsh Burke's Microcomputers 
Can Be Kidstujf, is a lovely example of the insider's approach to com- 
puter fluency. It's a guidebook on getting acquainted with your first 
microcomputer, and it's got all the right stuff in it— warnings and 
reassurances, instructions and suggestions. The unusual thing about this 
one is, it's written specifically for children. 

The author is a ftilly qualified "insider"; she's been a programmer 
since 1960, when there were only a couple of thousand computer in- 
stallations in the whole country. It's very unusual for a person with that 
kind of background to write a good book for beginners— the expert 
usually has a hard time seeing things from the beginner's viewpoint, but 
this book is an exception. This author understands a begiimer's perspec- 
tive very clearly, and the book's dedication explains why: The book is 
dedicated to her children. 

The book is a sort of "user's companion," a collection of all the 
things a begirmer needs to know (such as how to turn the system on, how 
to handle disks and cassettes, and so on), a discussion of things that can 
be done with a micro, an introduction to Basic and Pilot, and a collection 
of sample programs to mess around with. There is also a section on 
history, from Pascal's Engine to the sixties— the Age of Dinosaurs, as 
someone has called it. 

Burke's expertise is not limited to dinosaurs: She has both an Apple II 
and a Radio Shack Model II. That gives her a broader viewpoint than 
most people have. 



For a beginner's book, this one goes a long way. It covers obvious 
things, like copying a disk or tape, and less obvious things, like 
documentation. There's even a section covering what you need to know 
to buy a program, the kind of detail most books forget to mention. 

There's a chapter on program design, which is both simpler and more 
advanced than some adult treatments. It covers flowcharting, algorithms, 
structured programming, scientific notation, constants and variables, ar- 
rays, loops, debugging— all in clear and simple terms, with the emphasis 
on doing it yourself. 

There's also a chapter on Basic, which uses the same straightforward 
and simple approach to teach some fairly complex programming skills, 
such as the use of conditionals, subroutines, and loops. The example pro- 
grams include several math routines, a poker game, and a program that 
writes poetry. 

The author's background gives the book a comfortable balance be- 
tween fun and business. On the one hand, the approach is always im- 
mediate and specific— "Here's how to do it," but, on the other, there's 
a whole chapter on flowcharting, with the message "Look before you 
leap." The last chapter in the book is titled "Rules for My Own Com- 
puter." For all its youthful eagerness, this book has the air of a disci- 
plined professional about it. 

George Bernard Shaw said, "What a wonderful thing is youth— what

a sin to waste it on children!" The same could be said about this book: 
There are not many adult books as good. 

ComputerTown. The "insider's approach" is a good way to pro- 
mote an understanding of computers, but it's not the only way. Another 
new book describes a very successful "outsider's approach": the classic 
American town meeting pattern, or "Let's get together with the 
neighbors and find out about this!" 

The original ComputerTown got started in Menlo Park, California, 
when a couple of computer-book authors wanted to see how a group of 
beginners would interact with a computer. The writers took one of their 
computers to a local school and started giving classes once a week; 
before long, students were asking to be allowed to use the system be- 
tween classes. Eventually space was set aside in the public library, where 
several computers and a collection of software were made available for 
use by the whole community. 

This "public access computer project" grew so popular that the Na- 
tional Science Foundation became interested and provided funds to 
develop a detailed model of the Menlo Park project as a guide for other 
communities. There are now hundreds of ComputerTown projects 
around the country, quite a few in Great Britain, and others in Canada, 
Europe, and Africa. 

The book, ComputerTown, by Liza Loop, Julie Anton, and Ramon 
Zamora, is the latest version of the Menlo Park model — a detailed hand- 
book on starting a ComputerTown project in your own community. This 
is not a collection of visionary ideas but a set of practical techniques 
based on experience — a "how-to" book. 

It starts, as you'd expect, with advice on planning and organization, 
but the accent is on flexibility, not detail. To get started, all you need are 
a few good people, a physical location, and access to at least one 
microcomputer. The book makes the point that "due to their informal 
nature, ComputerTowns often take on lives of their own. ' ' It suggests that 
you "plan what you would like to see happen and adjust the plans as 
things develop." 

There's a chapter on offering events — various ways of introducing 
the community to your ComputerTown. Another chapter covers 
courseware and instruction, addressing such issues as what kinds of soft- 
ware to have available, how to introduce beginners to programming, 
how to set up "peer teaching" (in which the more advanced begiimers 
teach the less advanced), and so on. There's an appendix on taking care 
of equipment and another on resources. 

Perhaps the best way to summarize this book is by saying that, as you 
read it, you'll find yourself filling in the names of people and places in 
your own community and thinking how easily the ComputerTown ap- 
proach could work there. 

A Really Practical Guide. The "computer-literacy" problem that 
most educators worry about is not the local community, and it's not the 
students: It's the teachers themselves. If teachers are to lead the rest of us 
into the Land of Literacy, they must first have some knowledge 
themselves. So here's a resource guide for teachers: the Practical Guide 
to Computers in Education, by Coburn and others, from Addison- 
Wesley. 

This book is presented as the first in a series, and a very thorough ef- 
fort it is. It answers most of the questions you are likely to think of, from 
hardware to software, from classroom to administration, from pedagogy 
to system maintenance, from practice to philosophy. Never mind the 
details — it's a big book. 

In addition to being stuffed with information, the book is fun to read. 
Most of the examples are in the form of descriptive vignettes, or anec- 
dotes, which make for a pleasant break in the steady flow of information; 
and, while the authors take their subject seriously enough, they don't take 
it too seriously. 

If you're a teacher, your department has a new computer, and you 
want to spend all your budget on software and get only one book, this is 
probably the one you should get. 

Seminars and Conferences. Oklahoma State University is holding 
its third annual Microcomputers in Education conference on November 
18 and 19. This is a training conference for teachers in what is becoming 
the standard format. It will include papers, software and hardware 
demonstrations, hands-on time, and discussions with vendors and other 
experts. It will cover elementary, secondary, postsecondary, and special 
education, as well as teacher education and educational administration.

OCTOBER 1983 



The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics is sponsoring a 
series of similar programs, which they call seminars. These seminars 
will take place in Winnipeg, Manitoba, October 6-8; Atlanta, Georgia, 
December 7-9; Las Vegas, Nevada, January 23-25; and Miami, 
Florida, May 16-18. They will have substantially the same features as 
the University of Oklahoma conference events, with a focus on elemen- 
tary, intermediate, and secondary school mathematics. 

Attending conventions like these can be intense, but the experience 
may take you halfway to computer fluency in a single stride. In fact, 
here's an unofficial recipe for "14 Days to Computer Literacy": Start 
with a few days of access to a local computer to dissipate the encounter 
shock; then go to a conference like one of these; then return to spend a 
week or so with the local system (and your choice of software)— and 
you'll be talking to the computer like an old buddy. 

One more diing. If you're an educator working in the neighborhood 
of Toledo, Ohio, you might want to check in with CLUE, the Computer 
League for Users in Education, a local user group with a membership of 
one hundred fifty or so. They put out a quarterly newsletter, which con- 
tains news of local computer classes and activities, and they maintain a 
resource group to answer telephone questions about resources, local net- 
working contacts, and general advice (phone numbers are in the newslet- 
ter). It can be very comforting to know that you have a group of experts 
within such easy reach. 

So, whether we call it computer literacy or fluency or simply 
familiarity, we seem to be getting a handle on the matter. It won't be 
settled until computers are as common (and as inexpensive) as television 
sets, but, judging from the example of the hand calculator, that won't be 
long. And when that happens, nobody will talk about computer literacy 
any more— we'll all be too busy doing it!

LOGQ 

DOnfIA BEARDEh 

Once upon a time there was a cheerful and obedient turtle who was 
all too happy to draw and draw and draw. But he was just as interested in 
reading poetry and advenmre stories and maybe even trying to write 
some himself. So one day he put his drawing pens on the shelf and got 
out his nouns and verbs and his PRINT command. And he set to work 
one step at a time to create a program that would be fun, maybe a little 
silly, and one that could be useful in teaching parts of speech. 

These procedures were written in Apple Logo and used the com- 
mands PRINT, SENTENCE, READLIST, and MAKE. RANPICK, a 
procedure from the Apple Logo Reference Manual, is used to select a 
random item from a list. Each command will be briefly explained with 
examples for those who are just beginning to explore this "other aspect" 
of Logo. 

PRINT is a command that tells the computer to print something on 
the screen. Enclose what you want it to print in brackets. Try a few. 

PRINT [MY NAME IS RUMPELSTILTSKIN] 
PRINT [TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY] 
PRINT []{Llse this if you need a blank line.) 
PRINT [BIG DEAL! IS THIS ALL IT WILL DO?] 



If you're thinking big deal, you're ready for the next command. The 
PRINT command by itself isn't so hot, but start putting it in some pro- 
cedures and combining it with other commands and it can become very 
useful. 

SENTENCE is a command that combines words and lists. For exam- 
ple, if you type: 

PRINT SENTENCE [WHERE ARE YOU GOING] [FOR LUNCH 
TODAY?] 

the computer will combine the two lists into one sentence. 

PRINT can be abbreviated PR and SENTENCE can be abbre- 
viated SE. 

PR SE [ROSES ARE RED,] [BUTTERFLIES ARE FREE] 

Sometimes you will have three or more lists or words you want com- 
bined into one sentence. In that case you will have to enclose the com- 
mand in parentheses like this: 

PRINT (SENTENCE [WHERE IS] [ALL THIS] [LEADING TO?]) 

PRINT and SENTENCE become a lot more interesting when they 
are used with READLIST. This command enables you to begin creating 
interactive programs, which call for some kind of response from a user. 
For example, the following procedure combines the user's inputs, name 
and hometown, into sentences that make it seem like the computer is car- 
rying on an intelligent conversation. 

TO CONVERSE 

PRINT [WHAT IS YOUR NAME?] 
PRINT SENTENCE [HELLO,] READLIST 
PRINT [WHERE ARE YOU FROM?] 

PRINT SENTENCE READLIST [IS A GOOD PLACE TO BE FROMi] 
END 

MAKE is a command that is a lot easier to use than to explain. It re- 
quires two inputs; the first is die name of the variable, the second is the 
value. It is very helpful when used with the READLIST command 
because it enables you to store the user's input under a certain name and 
then call it back whenever you want. For example, we are going to 
develop a couple of semioriginal poems by plugging some crazy inputs 
into a very familiar nursery rhyme. 

First, here's how MAKE is used in the procedure: 

PRINT [NAME A BOY] 

MAKE "BOY READLIST 

PRINT SENTENCE [LITTLE BOY] :BOY 

If the user types in NAYLOR when the computer says to name a boy, 
the computer will store "NAYLOR" under the name BOY. In the 
PRINT SENTENCE line, the computer will combine LITTLE BOY 
with the input for :BOY and will print LITTLE BOY NAYLOR. 

Here is the computerized version of "Little Boy Blue. ' ' (Don't type it 
in just now; we'll have a chance at the end of the article to see these 
routines again.)

Time was, Billy would do almost 
anjrthing to duck his spelling home- 
work. 

But since Dad brought home Spelli- 
copter™ by DesignWarer Billy has 
become a spelling ace. As well as an 
ace chopper pilot. 

Because Spellicopter, like all 
DesignWare software products, com- 
bines computer game fun with sound 
educational principles. 

HOW BILLY BUILDS HIS 
WORD SKILLS. 

Each week, Billy or his parents type 
new spelling words into the SpeUi- 
copter game. Then Billy takes com- 
mand of his chopper and flies a 
mission through crowded skies, and 



mountainous terrain to recover the 
words. Letter by letter. And always 
in the right order. 

So by the time Billy gets back to 
the base, he's one proud pilot. And 
one tough speller. 

DESIGNWARE MAKES 
LEARNING COME ALIVE. 

If you own an Apple ][plus, Apple //e, 
IBM-PC, Atari 400, 800 or 1200XL 
with disk drive, you should take 
a close look at all the DesignWare 
software. 

Another word game, Crypto Cube™ 
is a great word puzzle the entire 
famfly will enjoy. Once you solve the 
word puzzles that come with Crypto 
Cube, you can even build your own. 



(415)546-1866 
for our free soft- 
ware catalog. 
Youll be de- 
lighted with the 
way your kids 
will learn with 
DesignWare. 

And they'll be 
playing for the 
fun of it.

Stacy, who is eight, came up with the following: 

Little Boy Naylor come blow your piccolo. 

The tiger's in the park, 

The lion's in the swimming pool. 

Where is the boy who looks after the tiger? 

He's in a closet fast asleep.

Stacy's story began like this: 

'Twas the night before April Fool's Day 
When all through the Empire State Building 
Not a creature was stirring 
Not even a shrew 

The hats were hung by the chimney with care 
In hopes that Judy Blume soon would be there 
The children were nestled 
All snug in their lamps 
While visions of candy 
Danced in their heads 

Try picking out key words from other poems and making up your 
own procedures. 

Once you've mastered the "semioriginjils," you might like to try 



your hand at random composition. In random composition, we'll give the 
computer a list of adjectives, nouns, verbs, and adverbs and it will ran- 
domly put them together to make silly sentences. 

RANPICK is a procedure from the Apple Logo Reference Manual. It 
prints a random element of a list. 

TO RANPICK :LIST 

PRINT ITEM (1 + RANDOM COUNT ±151) ;LIST 
END 



If you say: 

MAKE "NOUNS (BOYS GIRLS DOGS CATS HORSES] 
And then give the command: 
RANPICK :NOUNS 



the computer will respond by randomly picking one of the items from 
your list of nouns. 

In order to allow users to make up their own nouns, the following 
procedures were defined: 

TO NOUNLIST 

PRINT [NAME FIVE PLURAL NOUNS] 

MAKE "NOUNS READLIST 

END 

TO NOUN 
RANPICK :NOUNS 
END 

Similar procedures were defined for verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. 
SILLY was defined to combine a random adjective with a random noun 
with a random verb with a random adverb. It comes up with something, 
well . . . silly! 

COMPOSE was defined to put all the procedures together so the user 
could compose lots of silliness. Here's the entire program; it appears 
again later on.

The mystery man of the DOS trinity is the file manager. Few users of 
Apple DOS have ever met this faceless bureaucrat. This month and next 
you'll learn who he is, what he can do, and how to fill out his forms so 
he'll work for you. 

The only source of documentation on the file manager that we are 
aware of is the book Beneath Apple DOS, by Don Worth and Pieter 
Lechner. This month and next, DOStalk will expand upon and verily 
ideas that were first documented in this book. 

Rub-a-Dub-Dub. The file manager is one of the three programs that 
make up Apple DOS, as regular readers of this column are well aware. 
The other two are the DOS command interpreter, which we call the Cap- 
tain, and RWTS. 

The Captain intercepts your commands, figures out what you want to 
do, and passes your instructions to the file manager. 

The file manager is essentially a clerk. He stores files on your disks 
and retrieves them for you. He keeps track of where he puts things by 
writing notes to himself in special places on your disks. He cannot ac- 
tually read from or write to your disks; only RWTS can do that. But the 
file manager tells RWTS what to do and when to do it. 

For example, the file manager tells RWTS things like, "Load the 
contents of track 4, sector 8— of the disk currently in slot 6, drive 2— at 
byte 8192." The file manager makes his wishes known to RWTS by fill- 
ing in a table known as the Input/Output Control Block, or lOB. 

In a similar manner, the Captain gives orders to the file manager by 
filling in a table known as the File Manager Parameter List. He does this 
quite well, and many of you may be wondering why anyone would want 
to take this job away from him. 

In fact, there is precious little practical value to be derived from using 
the fde manager directly. But, as regular readers know, a great deal of 
the material presented in this colunm has little practical value. 

A direct link to the file manager can provide a few capabilities that 
are otherwise unavailable. For example, you can get the file manager to 
load a text fJe directly into memory— as if it were a binary file. Con- 
versely, you can read or write binary and Basic files a single byte at a 
time, just as text files are normally handled. 

In addition, as we saw last month, DOS is a little more difficult to use 
from assembly language than it is from Basic. In some situations, 
assembly language programmers may find it easier to deal with the file 
manager direcdy than to work with the Captain. For example, there is no 
need to determine the location of DOS in memory when working with the 
file manager directly, while, as we saw last month, this is quite important 
when dealing with the Captain. 

Only a few of you who read this column will ever find a good reason 
to actually use the information presented here. Nonetheless, everyone 
will leave with a better understanding of how DOS works and what can 
be done with it. 

Pigeon Bytes. The File Manager Parameter List, which is the table 
you fill out to tell the file manager what to do, is like a big box with in- 



terior partitions that create a number of smaller boxes, or pigeonholes. 

Some of the pigeonholes in the parameter list are only large enough 
for one-byte numbers. Others can hold two-byte numbers. Let's look at 
how we can use Basic to read the numbers in this table or store our own 
numbers there. 

In the following discussion, the variable ADR will always represent 
the address of the byte we want to read or write. The variable V will 
represent the value associated with that byte. 

It is quite easy to deal with one-byte numbers. Basic's peek and poke 
commands were designed to do just this. 

For example, V = peek(ADR) is the typical Basic command for find- 
ing out what value is stored at a specific address. Likewise, poke ADR,V 
is the typical method for storing a particular value at a certain address. 

The smallest number that can be stored in a single byte is 0. The largest 
number that can be stored in a single byte is 255. If you try to poke a 
value outside this range into a byte, Basic will beep you with an illegal 
quantity error. Larger values require the use of a two-byte number. 

The address of a two-byte number in memory is always considered 
to be the address of the first of the two bytes. There is no way to tell 
by looking at a byte whether it holds a one-byte number or half of a two- 
byte number. This is determined by the programmer when the program 
is written. In the case of the parameter list, we'll tell you which addresses 
hold one-byte numbers and which hold two-byte numbers. 

Think for a moment of a two-digit decimal number. One digit represents 
10s and the other digit represents units or Is. With a two-byte number, 
on the other hand, one byte represents 256s and the other Is. 

Essentially, using two-byte numbers requires a programmer to con- 
vert values from Basic's decimal, or base 10, number system to the com- 
puter memory's base 256 system. An additional complexity is that, in 
machine language, two-byte numbers are stored backward, the opposite 
of what we're used to with decimal numbers. 

Backward Is Easy. So far this may sound exceedingly complex, but 
it's really pretty easy. For example, to read a two-byte number, use the 
statement: 

V = PEEK (ADR) + (256 * PEEK (ADR + 1)) 

This statement adds the "units" byte, the first one at a specific ad- 
dress, to 256 times the second byte. V ends up as a decimal number in- 
dicating the value at the specified address. 

Writing a two-byte number is somewhat more difficult. The value we 
start with has to be separated into 256s and units. There are several ways 
to do this. This one's as good as any of them: 

POKE ADR+1, V / 256 : POKE ADR, V - (PEEK(ADR + 1)*256) 

In this method, the 256s byte is stored first. Basic will automatically 
determine how many 256s are in a value and throw away any remainder 



94 



OCTOBER 1983 



when a division occurs inside a poke, as it does here. The second part 
of the method stores the units byte. To figure out how many units were 
left, the statement takes the original value and subtracts from it 256 times 
whatever was stored in ADR+1 by the first poke. 

Since the parameter list doesn't always reside in the same place, let's 
refer to the pigeonholes using a variable that holds the beginning address 
of the list and an offset that identifies specific pigeonholes. Assume the 
address of the parameter list has been stored in the variable FARM. Then 
the first byte of the parameter list would be PARM+0. The second byte 
would be PARM + 1, and so on. 

Vectors Revisited. In June this column discussed the page three vec- 
tor table. Those of you who read that column might remember that one 
of the vectors in that table is used to call the file manager and another 
is used to find the parameter list. 

To use these vectors correctly, it is necessary to peek and poke some 
special memory locations, called registers, that are in the Apple's 
microprocessor itself. Unformnately, Basic's peek and poke commands 
can be used only with standard memory locations. To handle the registers 
we'll have to use some short assembly language routines. 

In a moment we'll look at a short Basic program that will load these 
assembly language routines for you. First, though, let's look at the routines 
themselves. They are simple enough that you should be able to under- 
stand how they work even if you've never seen an assembly language pro- 
gram before. 

FINDPARM JSR $3DC 
STA $4F 
STY $4E 
RTS 

NEOFILE LDX #$01 
JSR $3D6 
RTS 

OLDFILE LDX #$00 
JSR $3D6 
RTS 

The routine called FINDPARM begins by jumping to the subroutine 
(JSR) at memory address $3DC (in decimal that's 988). This subroutine 
is in the page three vector table. It is the one used to find the address of 
the parameter list. The page three routine stores the address of the 
parameter list in two of the microprocessor's registers. The high byte is 
stored in the A register; the low byte is stored in the Y register. 

Then the page three subroutine returns to FINDPARM. It immediate- 
ly stores the contents of the A register (STA) at location $4F (79) and the 



contents of the Y register (STY) at location $4E (78). Then FINDPARM 
ends with RTS, return from subroutine. 

Now that we have the address of the parameter list stored at bytes 78 
and 79, it will be very easy to retrieve it using the two-byte peek de- 
scribed earlier. 

Any Reservations So Far? The other two routines, NEOFILE and 
OLDFILE, are used to call the file manager. Whenever the file manager 
is called, the microprocessor's X register must be loaded (LDX) with 
either a zero or a one. A zero indicates that, if the requested file is not 
found on the disk, it should be created. A one indicates that, if the file 
isn't found, the file manager should simply say so and not create one. 

After the X register is loaded with the proper value, we jump to the 
page three vector that leads to the file manager, wherever he might be in 
memory. This vector is at byte $3D6 (982). 

You may be wondering why the first of these two routines is named 
NEOFILE instead of NEWFILE. As you will see in a moment, these 
words will be used in a Basic program, and Basic won't let us use the 
word new inside a variable. 

Here's the Basic program that will load in these routines: 

200 FINDPARM = 768 

210 NEOFILE = FINDPARM +8 

220 OLDFILE = FINDPARM + 14 

230 FOR ADR = FINDPARM TO FINDPARM + 19 

240 READV 

250 POKE ADR.V 

260 NEXT 

270 GALL FINDPARM 

280 PARM = PEEK(78) + PEEK(79)*256 

300 DATA 32,220,3,133,79,132,78,96 

310 DATA 162,1,32,214,3,96 

320 DATA 162,0,32,214,3,96 

The routines are loaded at byte 768 ($300), but by changing the value 
in line 200 you can modify this. The routines are completely relocatable. 

After this Basic routine has been run, three variables are set up for 
later use. PARM holds the address of the File Manager Parameter List; 
NEOFILE holds the address of the routine to be called to tell the file 
manager to create a new file; OLDFILE holds the address of the routine 
to be called to inform the fde manager that no new file should be created. 

The Parameter List. Now that we know how to find the parameter 
list and its pigeonholes, let's take a look at the list itself. The accompany- 
ing figure shows what the various pigeonholes are used for with house- 
keeping commands. The structure of the list is somewhat different 
with fUe access commands (read and write)— we'll take a look at those 
next month.

The very first byte of the parameter list (PARM+0) holds the com- 
mand. This can be a number ranging from 1 to 12. As shown in the 
figure, 1 indicates open, 2 close, 5 delete, and so on. 

The second byte of the list (FARM + 1) is used only with the init com- 
mand. The next two bytes are used with open and rename only; we'll 
discuss all these later. 

FARM -1-4 is used for the disk's volume number. This can be a 
number between 1 and 254, in which case the file manager will return a 
volume mismatch error if the volume number of the disk in the drive 
doesn't match the number given in the parameter list. You can also put a 
zero here. In that case the volume number of the disk will be ignored. 

FARM -I- 5 indicates the drive you want to use. FARM -I- 6 indicates 
the slot. 

FARM -1-7 is the file type pigeonhole. Actually, the file manager 
doesn't concern himself much with file types. As we will see next month, 
he never returns a file type mismatch error. The Captain does that. 

If you are calling the file manager through OLDFILE (no new file 
will be created), the value you have in FARM 7 is ignored. However, 
you can look in FARM -1-7 after the call is finished to determine what the 
file type of the file was. 

On the other hand, if you call the file manager through NEOFILE (if 
file not found, create it) and a new file is created, it will be given the file 
type you have specified in FARM -I- 7. 

Interestingly, several of the commands will actually create new 
files if you call them through NEOFILE. Open will do it, of course, but 
so will lock, unlock, rename, and verify. This makes no sense, but it 
shows you how important it is to call the file manager through OLDFILE 
rather than NEOFILE, unless you really do want a new file on your 
hands. 

The File Name. FARM -t- 8 is a two-byte value. Two-byte values are 
often memory addresses. The maximum value that can be stored in a 
two-byte value is 65,535, which, by design, is also the highest possible 
memory address in an Apple n computer. 

The name of the file you want to use must be stored at the address you 
poke into FARM 4-8. If you are working in Basic, you need to poke the 



file name somewhere into memory and file a pointer to it in FARM + 8. 
In addition, you need to pad the file name with blanks so it will be thirty 
characters long. 

Assuming you have the file name you want to use stored in the 
variable F$, the first .section of the following program segment will pad 
it with blanks, the second will poke it at whatever memory location 
NAME points to, and the third will put NAME in the parameter list. 

700 FOR I = LEN(F$)+1 TO 30 

710 F$ = F$-h" " : REM (BLANK SPACE BETWEEN QUOTES) 

720 NEXT 

730 : 

740 FOR I = 1 TO 30 

750 POKE (NAME- 1) + I, 128 + ASC(MID$(F$,I,1)) 

760 NEXT 

770 : 

780 POKE FARM + 9. NAME / 256 

790 POKE FARM + 8, NAME - PEEK(PARM + 9)*256 

A suitable value for NAME would be 788 ($314). This would store 
the file name in some unused memory bytes right after our assembly 
language routines. 

FARM -I- 10 is the pigeonhole the file manager uses to pass back any 
error code. A zero at this location when the file manager is finished in- 
dicates that no error occurred. Otherwise the standard DOS error 
number will be stored here. We'll examine the file manager errors fur- 
ther next month. 

Buffeted by Buffers. In the July DOStalk, we discussed the DOS 
buffers that the Captain reserves for the file manager's use. Every open 
file is allocated a DOS buffer. Each DOS buffer contains a 45-byte space 
known as the work-area buffer, a 256-byte space known as the track/sec- 
tor list buffer, and a 256-byte space known as the data buffer. 

The parameter list contains pigeonholes for storing the addresses of 
these buffers. When the file manager is called, he looks in the parameter 
list to find out where these buffers are. 

The value stored at FARM -I- 12 is the address of the work-area buff-

OCTOBER 198: 



er. FARM + 14 points to the track/sector list buffer. FARM + 16 points 
to the data buffer. 

When you use DOS in the normal manner, the Captain will find an 
empty DOS buffer and fill in these pigeonholes with the correct ad- 
dresses for that buffer. When you call on the file manager directly, you 
have to do it yourself. The buffers you provide can be anywhere in 
memory— you don't have to use the normal DOS buffers. Often it is 
easier to set aside room in your own program space for these buffers. If 
you would prefer to use the standard DOS buffers, July's article ex- 
plains how you can determine which ones are in use and which ones 
are vacant. 

On the other hand, if you would prefer to use your own buffers and if 
you are programming in Basic, an easy way to set aside memory for the 
buffers is to use the himem command. For example: 

100 HIMEM: 25000 
110 WRKBUF = 25000 
120 TSBUF =WRKBUF + 45 
130 DTABUF = TSBUF +256 

This sets aside the memory area from byte 25000 ($61 A8) to the DOS 
buffers (usually byte 38400— $96(X)) for use by your program. Using the 
two-byte poke method demonstrated earlier, you would enter WRKBUF, 
TSBUF, and DTABUF into the parameter list at locations FARM + 12, 
FARM + 14, and FARM + 16. 

Calling the File Manager. The parameter list figure indicates which 
pigeonholes are actually used with each command. For example, to 
order the file manager to do a catalog, you would put the number for the 
catalog command, 6, in FARM+0 and enter the slot, drive, and address 
of the work-area buffer in the appropriate places. Then call OLDFILE 
and a catalog will appear on your screen. (In this case you could also call 
NEOFILE; catalog won't create a new file.) 

When control returns to your program, you should take a peek at 
FARM + 10, the error code. If this value is zero, the catalog executed 
successfully. If it is nonzero, an error occurred. 

Operation of delete, lock, and unlock is very similar. You must also 



provide a volume number, the address of the file name, and the address 
of the track/sector list buffer. If you call the file manager through 
NEOFILE, and if the file you've requested doesn't exist, a new one will 
be created. It will be assigned the file type specified in FARM +7. If you 
call the file manager through OLDFILE, you can look at FARM +7 after 
the call to find out the type of the file. 

There is nothing about either the lock or unlock command that re- 
quires it to use a file's track/ sector list. Nonetheless, the file manager 
will load it into the track/sector list buffer when these commands are ex- 
ecuted. The reason for this is that there is a single subroutine within the 
file manager that is always used with any housekeeping command that 
handles a single file (except close). 

Thus open, delete, lock, unlock, rename, and verify all use this 
routine. This same routine is responsible for creating new files when the 
specified file isn't found, which accounts for the strange ability of some 
of the commands to create new files when accessed through NEOFILE. 

Special Stuff. The rename command also requires a pointer to the 
new file name. As can be seen in the figure, the address of the new file 
name should be in FARM +2. 

FARM +2 is used by the open command to indicate record length. If 
you are opening a random access file, FARM +2 should hold a two-byte 
number indicating the length of the records in that file. With any other 
file type, FARM +2 should hold a one and FARM + 3 a zero. This will 
make the record length on these files equal to one. {Beneath Apple DOS 
indicates that a zero should be stored here. This will work too, but the 
file manager will change it to a one.) 

FARM + 1 is used during the init command. The file manager has to 
be told where DOS is so he can correctly copy it onto the newly initial- 
ized disk. With DOS at its normal 48K location, 157 is the correct value 
for this pigeonhole. 

Flay around with the information presented here. One warning, how- 
ever: Make sure the disk you have in your drive as you test your program 
is expendable. One mistake and you could damage it. 

Next month we'll continue this investigation by looking at the file 
manager's file access commands, read and write. Ill

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? 

Are you tired of waiting for DOS to load and save 
files? Are you tired of waiting for DOS to finish so 
you can type again? Are you tired of waiting for 
your printer? When you buy DIVERSI-DOS'", 
by Bill Basham, you won't have to wait any more! 
Here's why: 

1, DOS speed-up: Apple DOS 3,3 takes 18 disk 
revolutions to read a single track, whereas 
DIVERSI-DOS reads or writes a track in just 2 
revolutions. This speeds up file processing 
tremendously (see table). 

2. Keyboard Buffer: DIVERSI-DOS allows you 
to type ahead, as fast as you can, without missing 
a single character. 

3, Print Buffer: DIVERSI-DOS can use a RAM 

card (16K-128K) to temporarily save characters 
before they are printed. Thus, your computer 
won't have to wait for your printer to finish. 

4. DDMOVER: DIVERSI-DOS can now be 

moved to a RAM card to increase the available 
memory in a BASIC program, 
DIVERSI-DOS, the QUADRUPLE utility, 
requires a 48K Apple II, 11+ or e with DOS 3.3. A 
simple, menu-driven installation program is 
included on the un protected disk. So what are 
you waiting for?

Who Will Win at 




Bv ADAHs III 



The door to the future opened a crack recently in New York City, and 
beautiful pictures streamed out of it. From June 27 through 29, Videotex 
'83 took place at the New York Hilton. This was the third international 
videotex conference organized by an English company, London On-line. 

A fledgling field that is a combination of cable, video, and com- 
puters, videotex is undergoing severe growing pains. Videotex is not a 
home-grown cottage industry, as were the early cable and satellite in- 
dustries. The cost of playing in this game is in the high millions. A quick 
tour of the sixty companies exhibiting at the conference yielded such 
heavy hitters as IBM, Sony, Digit£d Equipment Corporation, General 
Electric, Panasonic, NBC, North American Phillips, Time, and Amer- 
ican Bell. 

With returns on their investments almost nonexistent so far, some 
players are getting skittish. What's needed most is industry stabilization. 
Instead, as of this summer's conference, there were two standards of 
videotex, each drawing adherents and threatening to tear apart the in- 
dustry in a struggle reminiscent of the early VHS versus Beta wars that 
happened in the video industry not so long ago. 

New News. What is videotex and why all the fuss? A quick recap of 
videotex's brief history should provide some answers. 

Like the Source or CompuServe, videotex is an informational 
database. But while those two U.S. systems transmit only text, videotex 
transmits pictures as well. Information is sent over cable or telephone 
lines and can be received only by special decoding terminals. Advertis- 
ing is an integral part of most systems, and is shown either in between 
sections of information or run bannerlike across the bottom of the screen. 

Videotex was first signed for commercial use by the English and the 
French a few years ago. The British system is called Prestel and is wide- 
ly used abroad, while the French Telematique is hardly seen outside of 
France. Depending on the system, many forms of information are 
available on-line, including current news, weather, sports news, airline 
schedules, and large reference encyclopedias. 

If you travel and frequently stay in hotels and motels, you may have 
seen the early U.S. attempts at transmitted information. Through cable 
channels to the rooms, a form of electronic publishing called Newsvideo 
is broadcast to guests. Newsvideo is transmitted only in alphanumeric 
(nongraphic) text similar to modem transmissions via an Apple or IBM 
Personal Computer. Yet, according to a report released at the Videotex 
'83 conference by Pacific Satellite Corporation of San Francisco, eighty- 
eight U.S. newspapers produced Newsvideo information services this 
year, reaching people at nearly 1.4 million locations as of May 1, 1983. 

Videotex is quite different from Newsvideo. While much of the basic 
information is the same, videotex incorporates stunning visuals. 

Britain's Prestel system achieves this by means of alphamosaic 
transmission. The term alphamosaic refers to the fact that information is 
sent in small blocks. Each block is two pixels (dots) wide by three pixels 
high; sixty-four different block combinations are possible. A picture is 
transmitted block by block to the receiving terminal. There, a special 
decoder reassembles the information into a picture on-screen. The screen 
picture, while hi-res, isn't perfect, and the shapes it produces are 
somewhat difficult to distinguish. 

The Prestel system sends these blocks according to a fixed pattern. 
Prestel sends through only the changes in a block, rather than each block 
in its entirety. So, if a large area of a picture is all one color or shape, no 
data is sent for that section; instead, the current block is repeated in the 
pattern until a change is called for. Thus the alphamosaic system is very 
fast and cuts down on operating costs. 

The Art of Info. Not long after the introduction of the Prestel 
system, the Canadians improved upon it, creating an alternate service 
called Telidon. Telidon transmits pictures over cable by means of a 
revolutionary technology known as alphageometric. This system sends a 



102 



R O F T A I 1^ 



OCTOBER 1983 



picture pixel by pixel. These pixels, like those in Prestel, are decoded at 
a receiving terminal. The system also incorporates special coding 
transmissions that tell the system to draw certain shapes. Not only can 
Telidon draw dots, it can draw six shapes, including lines, arcs, and 
polygons. The pictures it produces are breathtaking. 

Very high degrees of resolution are possible with the alphageometric 
approach, but it is slow and hence much more expensive to operate than 
alphamosaic. Telidon has a special feature— the ability to shift into 
something called alphaphotographic mode (still got all these alphas 
straight?). This makes it possible to do very slow bit mapping, which 
means that photographs can be transmitted over cable or telephone lines. 
Alphaphotographic mode is similar to the Quix photo-transmittal service 
currently being used in many businesses. 

As of early last year, Prestel was doing a very good job of lining up 
franchisees for its service in the American markets. Then a bombshell 
hit. High-tech megagiant American Bell took a fancy to the Canadian 
system. Some judicious tinkering at Bell Labs resulted in the develop- 
ment of a souped-up version of Telidon 's system. This one offers twelve 
drawing functions instead of six and a picture quality that is outstanding. 




Teletext transmits concise information quicl<ly, using text supported by 
graphics. 



In true fashion, American Bell called the system NAPLES, short for 
North American Presentation Level Protocol Syntax. 

Because of its many connections and devotees, Prestel managed to 
hold its own against the newcomer through the winter. A big boost in 
morale for Prestel came this past spring, when Teletext was launched. 

Teletext uses the alphamosaic system for broadcasting. This was 
good news to the Europeans because it created an instant and enormous 
market for European decoder boxes. Such was the shape of things going 
into the June conference. 

Teletext is a joint venture of two television networks, NBC and CBS. 
Instead of transmitting pictures by cable or telephone lines, the networks 
dreamed up the idea of using television broadcasts. They developed their 
own standard (of course), the North American Broadcast Teletext 
Specification (NABTS). 

A Big Broadcast. Teletext is not videotex exactly, but it resembles it. 
Videotex is a two-way system in which the user interacts with most of the 
services, such as electronic mail, catalog ordering, and ticket reserva- 
tions. With Teletext, the interface is minimal, mostly confined to select- 
ing what you want to look at. Selections are made via a decoder box in 
the home. The analogy of a remote control TV channel turner is apt. 

Teletext transmits information on the upper edge of your regular 
television screen, along with the normal network feed. Look very closely 
at a normal television picture and you'll spot a tiny band of black at the 
top of the screen. We're so used to seeing this as a normal part of the pic- 
ture that we hardly realize it's there. Within that black area are twenty- 
one lines of unused transmission space known as the vertical blanking in- 
terval (VBI) . Captioned broadcasts for the hearing-impaired use line 2 1 
now. Teletext will use lines 15 through 19; transmissions will be com- 
pletely invisible unless you have a decoder box. (Maybe someday they 



will even bring back decoder rings. Ah, Captain Video, you were only a 
few years ahead of your time!) 

Speaking at Videotex '83 before a packed house, Barbara Watson, 
general manager of NBC Teletext, described the success of NBC's trial 
broadcast. This historic event occurred in April 1983 at the National 
Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas. Watson expressed 
the belief that Teletext will do better than videotex because it is a mass 
medium that will reach far more homes than videotex and because the 
network has vast production facilities to produce high-quality program- 
ming. She also noted that "the fundamental problem with videotex lies in 
the two-way connection to the home. Access to the phone line is not 
cheap, and the user of a videotex system will have to pay for the connec- 
tion time— even the time he is sitting in front of the terminal figuring out 
what to do." 

Clash of Titans. The alphamosaic crowd went into Videotex '83 
feeling terrific, but the roof caved in the very first day. First, IBM an- 
nounced at the show that it was going to adopt someone else's standard 
(IBM usually insists on an IBM standard for everything). Henceforth, 
the official IBM videotex standard would be American Bell's NAPLPS. 
Off the record, IBM personnel said that while they would continue to 
suppwrt interface equipment for the Prestel system, the main thrust of the 
company was going to be in support of the development of the NAPLPS. 

While the Prestel group was reeling from this blow. International 
Videotex Teletext News announced that NAPLPS was on the verge of be- 
ing accepted as the official videotex standard for both the United States 
and Canada. The rout was almost complete. The eight thousand Videotex 
'83 attendees spent most of their time jammed around the booths of com- 
panies that supported the alphageometric system. 

Riding the crest of all that enthusiasm, two other companies announced 
the debut of competing NAPLPS-standard videotex systems, both 
scheduled to be on-line within a year. Beginning in the second quarter of 
1984, the Times Mirror Company will be sponsoring the Gateway 
videotex service under the company name Videotex America. Initially, 
Videotex America will serve the greater Los Angeles area. Gateway's 
startup database will offer fifty thousand pages of information and 
services. 

At Videotex '83, the company announced the results of its initial field 
test, which took place last year in Rancho Palos Verdes and Mission Vie- 
jo, California. Some three hundred fifty households in these two small 
southern California communities participated. Rated as "essential" were 
games (79 percent), shopping/product information (72 percent), bill pay- 
ing at a bank (71 percent), late-breaking news (60 percent), education for 
children (57 percent), and electronic mail (56 percent). Input from the 
Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times, and community newspapers 
made more than three thousand pages of news available daily. 

Times Mirror's big competitor in this game is another newspaper 
supergiant, Knight-Ridder Newspapers. The Knight-Ridder service 
(which has received much assistance from American Bell) is called 
Viewtron. Scheduled to be operational by year's end, Viewtron is slated 
to offer its customers a cornucopia of services and information. Accord- 
ing to Knight-Ridder, more than one hundred and fifty advertisers have 
signed up to participate. In addition, fifty Informational Providers (IPs) 
are on-board to provide information on a wide range of topics. 

Seven Guides for Seven Druthers. Besides providing all the usual 
videotex services, Viewtron offers subscribers seven gateways. These 
are not to be confused with Times Mirror's Gateway. Each of 
Viewtron 's gateways links a computer system at some other company in- 
to the Viewtron system. The result is basically a networking arrangement 
that allows Viewtron users to connect with computer systems in various 
parts of the country. 

Viewtron's seven gateways link subscribers up with American Ex- 
press, Commodity News Service, E.F. Hutton, Grolier Academic 
American Encyclopedia, J.C. Penney (the whole catalog), the Official 
Airline Guide, and VideoFinancial Services. The Grolier gateway gains 
the subscriber entree to a computer in Philadelphia that contains the en- 
tire nine-million-word, twenty-eight-thousand-article-entry encyclo- 
pedia—the only one of its kind in the country. The J.C. Penney gateway 
allows subscribers to order (and immediately confirm the availability of) 
any item from the catalog. 

Writing in a recent issue of the Washington Journalism Review, John 
Morton observed, "The market niche Viewtron is likely to capture may 
be small but it is the heart of the high-income, well-educated sector that

daily newspapers now dominate. It is the dailies' ability to deliver this 
part of the market that is their enduring appeal to major advertisers." 

The fact that so many newspapers are jumping on the Viewtron band- 
wagon certainly supports Morton's view. Boston is slated to be the next 
Viewtron market, under the auspices of the Boston Globe. Among the 
other newspap)ers (and their cities) scheduled for inclusion within a few 
years are the Detroit Free Press, the Baltimore Sun-Times , the 
Philadelphia Inquirer, the San Jose Mercury, the Rocky Mountain News, 
the Seattle Times, the Star-Telegram (Fort Worth, TX), and the Star- 
Ledger (Newark, NJ). The typical setup will be for the participating 
newspaper to receive 75 percent of the revenue, while Viewtron gets 
the rest. 

Texual Ceiling. Viewtron plans to offer a controversial new 
service— electronic banking. The main issues this raises have to do with 
privacy and security. John Wooley, chairman of the Videotex Industry 
Association's (VIA) fair practice committee, addressed these concerns at 
the conference. "Many people want to know whether this new 
technology will invade their privacy," said Wooley. "They can be 
reassured by the fact that, to date, there have been no reported privacy 
abuses in the videotex industry . ' ' 

In an effort to preserve that fine record, Viewtron will use the Na- 
tional Bureau of Standards's Data Encryption Standard (DES). 
Viewtron's Bill Ritter, who also spoke at the conference, stated that this 
encryption system is so good that it would take a state-of-the-art com- 
puter ten years to explore all the permutations required to break the code. 

So far, Knight-Ridder has invested $26 million in Viewtron. The 
basic fees charged to subscribers are a modest twelve dollars per month 
(decoder box included) plus an estimated average connect cost via phone 
lines of fourteen dollars per month. This last estimate is probably much 
too low, however, as it is based on a daily usage of half an hour. None of 
that seems terribly expensive, but there's a kicker— a special terminal, 
priced at around six hundred dollars, is needed. The price of this ter- 
minal is likely to stop many people cold. The problems of hardware and 



its cost were addressed at Videotex '83. A big stir came with American 
Bell's unveiling of its sleek new Spectre consumer videotex terminal. 
Designed expressly to be used with Viewtron, this 1200-baud terminal 
features a wireless keypad and built-in encryption/security features for 
banking. The price is still in the six-hundred-dollar range. Sony 
displayed the new Sony Trinitron KITX-8300 videotex terminal — a real 
eye-catcher. Sony's terminal includes a buUt-in modem, a slim keypad, 
and, as an added option, a small upright thermal printer that can print a 
videotex screen in only thirteen seconds. 

A major thrust of the videotex industry today is to find ways to bring 
the cost of terminals down to under two hundred dollars. The most prom- 
ising research centers on the large microcomputer base already in ex- 
istence in the United States. Provided that cheap interfaces can be found 
for Apples, IBM pes, and Commodores, the videotex systems should 
really take off. 

In the July issue of his newsletter, Teleservices Report, Gary Arlen 
cites some pertinent information from a special American Bell research 
report. This report concluded that the potential videotex market is 
broken into two segments: "high affluent households, with income of 
more than $25,000 annually (and representing 30 percent of all U.S. 
households), and technological innovators and early adapters, which 
draw from all age levels." This last group certainly sounds like the 
average microcomputer owner. 

An announcement made at this sununer's conference proclaimed that, 
effective sometime this fall, alphamosaic interface boards will be sold for 
the Apple and Commodore. The IBM interface is to be aimounced short- 
ly. Should Prestel manage to integrate microcomputer owners into the 
videotex evolution, the French group may still emerge a victor in the 
struggle to dominate an industry that promises to be highly lucrative. 
Then again, who knows? Perhaps an entirely new alpha something or 
other is waiting in the wings to supplant both systems. 

The next five years of videotex will definitely not be boring. Tune in 
and watch the fun. The door is opening wider all the time. HI I

WITH 
EVERYTHING. 



Your best buy in modem history. The 
Networker™ a plug-in singie-slot di- 
rect connect modem for your Apple II, 
II + , and He (or Franklin, Albert, or 
other Apple compatible computer). 
You are immediately linked to the 
vast network of computers — data 
bases like the Source? Compu- 
serve® or Dow Jones r friends, banks 
businesses, and hundreds of local "bulletin 
boards." For only $129. There's absolutely 
nothing else to buy. And it even comes with 
software. 

This is the modem that does it all, and does 
it for less. The Apple Communications Card is on 
board, so you won't need to buy one. That will 
save a bunch. It's 300 baud, the most commonly 
used type of modem. It comes complete with its 
own communications software on Apple compati- 
ble disk, giving you features no modem offers. 

Like "data capture" to lock the messages 
into your Apples' RAM, and then move the infor- 
mation onto a disk for easy reference and review. 
A terminal program that turns your computer into 
a communications command center, displaying 
on-screen "help" menus, continuous updates of 
memory usage, carrier presence, baud rate, 
communications status, all while taking in and 
displaying information from any computer. 

The Networker supports both originate and 
answer modes, so you can send and receive in- 
formation, in full or half duplex modes. And its 
all easily programmable right from the keyboard 
of your Apple computer. All you do is plug Net- 
worker into any slot (except 0) in your Apple 
computer. It'll even ask you what slot it's in. 
It's that easy to use. 




NETMASTER^" COMMUNICATIONS 
SOFTWARE 

For $179 we include the even more incredible 
Netmaster software for advanced users. Net- 
master is a "communications freeway" that 
lets you speed any Apple file to another Apple 
through noisy phone lines, without errors. Net- 
master even includes its own Disk Operating 
System to control the flow of information and 
leave you over 40K of "buffer" memory from 
your 64K RAM. And there's always help when 
you want it. On screen. Status indicators keep 
you fully updated. 

Netmaster will let you transfer games, 
computer graphics, programs, sales reports, 
documents, any DOS 3.3 file, all directly from 
disk to disk, all with computer (not telephone) 
accuracy. Netmaster is completely configurable 
to understand any computer, even mainframes. 
File size is unlimited. 

But Netmaster is not stuffy. It will talk to 
the other communications packages like Visi- 
term® or ASCII Express* Of course they don't 
support Netmaster's superb error checking, 
that guarantees you won't miss even a comma. 
It doesn't only talk to the Networker either. It 
will also talk to those more expensive modems 
from Hayes and Novation. 



And Netmaster is fast. It trans- 
fers information disk to disk three to 
five times faster than the others. Of 
course Netmaster is fully compatible 
with them. But if you want things to 
happen really fast, talk to another 
Netmaster. 
We sell Netmaster by itself for $79, 
and even if you have another modem for your 
Apple, Netmaster is an outstanding value. It will 
even support auto dial and auto answer. Net- 
master requires 48K of Apple memory, disk 
drive and DOS 3.3, and ZOOM'S Networker 
modem or another modem. It can also be used 
without a modem when two Apples are hard- 
wired together, using a 6850 or 6551 -based in- 
terface card. 

Networker, Netmaster, and Networker/ 
Netmaster combo are all produced in the USA 
by ZOOM Telephonies, producers of the popular 
DEMON DIALER. The Networker is FCC regis- 
tered, and all products come with a one-year 
warranty.

SOFtCARD 
Symposhim 

by Gt^g ISbbetts 



Welcome to the October installment of Soft- 
Card Symposium and our continuing discussion 
of the BIOS disk I/O routines. This month we'll 
begin studying READ and WRITE, the most 
complex of the BIOS functions. It's ironic that 
while these two routines are separate and distinct, 
in fact they're usually only short preparation 
routines for a much larger section of code com- 
mon to both of them; it is this larger section of 
code that actually jierforms the read or write. 

Setting things up in this fashion has been a 
fairly constant practice since the early days of 
CP/M. The reason READ and WRITE are im- 
plemented this way has to do with the nature of 
the disk access hardware in most computers. Gen- 
erally speaking, the same tasks are performed 
regardless of whether a read or write is in prog- 
ress; the only difference is in the direction of data 
transfer— from memory to disk during a write and 
from disk to memory during a read. 

Since in most computers the hardware of the 
disk controller performs the actual manipulation 
of data on the disk surface, the software need per- 
form only three basic functions. First, it must 
prepare the controller for action; second, it must 
tell the controller in which direction the data will 
go; and third, it must send and receive data to 
and from the controller. 

Controller preparation is usually the most 
complex of these three functions. Often the soft- 
ware must select a particular drive, perform a 
seek to a particular track, load the read/write head 
of the drive onto the disk surface, and do other 
things specific to the controller in use. Each of 
these preparation tasks often requires precise tim- 
ing and close monitoring. 

The second function (the one that tells the con- 
troller whether this is a read or write) usually in- 
volves just loading a single-byte command into 
a register on the controller. Likewise, the third 
function may be as simple as passing a single 
command byte to the computer's DMA hardware. 

Since function number one must be per- 
formed the same way regardless of whether the 
action is a read or write, and since this function 
is the most complex of the three, it only makes 
sense to make this function common to both 
operations, thereby avoiding a lot of unnecessary 
duplication of code. In this way, the system is 
made more efficient in terms of both speed and 
memory usage. This explains why most BIOS im- 
plementations have a single routine that both 




reads and writes data that can be entered via either 
a read entry point or a write entry point. These 
two entry points, then, must in some way inform 
the routine as to which type of operation is to be 
performed. In a very simple BIOS (one that deals 
only with single-density IBM 3740 format, for 
example), this is all that needs to be done. More 
modem BIOS implementations, such as those 
dealing with sector sizes larger than 128 bytes 
or with more than one type of disk drive in the 
same system, must be made more complex. 

Today, most BIOS implementations are of the 
latter variety. The popularity of double-density 
and double-sided disk drives, as well as that of 
fixed media hard drives, has made this inevitable. 
The most common factor that must be addressed 
is the larger sector sizes used by modem systems. 
Since CP/M was designed to handle only the 
128-byte sectors used in the IBM 3740 format, 
virtually everything CP/M does is based on this 
unit of data. Therefore, using disk drives with 
256-, 5 12-, or 1,024-byte sectors means that 
some method of translation must be implement- 
ed so that the BIOS can give BDOS what it 
needs when requested. The processes involved 
in this translation are known as blocking and 
deblocking. 

In deblocking, the BIOS reads in a sector of 
information, say 512 bytes. Then, by dividing 
that sector into 128-byte logical subsectors, the 
BIOS can pass to BDOS the subsector BDOS has 
requested. This process has become known as 
deblocking because the block of data (the phys- 
ical sector) is split into its component CP/M file 
records (the subsectors). 

The blocking process is exactly the reverse 
of deblocking and takes place during write oper- 
ations. Individual CP/M file records are placed 
in a memory buffer the size of a physical record. 
They are placed there in an order based on their 
logical sector numbers. When a complete block 
of these records has been assembled, the entire 
physical sector is written to disk. 

Obviously, the BIOS for such a system must 
be much more complex than that for IBM single- 
density format. If BDOS read or wrote all subsec- 
tors in exact order and then fully requested or 
filled all physical sectors, the blocking process 
would not have to be so elaborate. But since 
BDOS thinks of the subsectors as actual physical 
sectors, it may often read or write only one sub- 
sector in a given physical sector before going to 



a different one or even to a different track or disk. 

This tendency on the part of BDOS means that 
the BIOS designer must take all possibilities 
into account. Each time BDOS requests a write, 
the designer must assume the worst possible case; 
that is, the designer must assume that this is the 
only write BDOS will make to this specific 
physical sector. It's obvious that if the worst case 
just mentioned were tme, the BIOS could not 
simply install the subsector into the buffer and 
write the sector. Doing that would in fact over- 
write and destroy any other subsectors in this 
physical sector on the disk. To avoid having this 
happen, the BIOS must perform a preread; that 
is to say the BIOS must read the appropriate 
physical sector into the memory buffer before ac- 
cepting the subsector from BDOS. When BIOS

How HP business graphi< 




Enhance your reputation for being more pro- 
fessional, persuasive, credible and effective 
than your competition with the new HP 7475A 
Business Professional's Plotter. 

Make a first impression that lasts 

The vital importance of graphics to today's business professional 
cannot be overstated. In survey 
after survey, statistics prove 
graphics can help you 
spot trends and relation- 
ships quickly, 
analyze data 
accurately, and 
communicate 
your ideas 
with more 




clarity 
and power 
than in any 
other way. 

Even more im- 
portant, graphics 
can actually increase 
personal and company 
productivity. And create a 
first impression of quality and 
professionalism that lasts and lasts. 

Graphics: the end to meetings 
that go nowhere 

In a fascinating research project conducted by The University of 
Pennsylvania, 123 MBA candidates were involved in a study 
designed to test the effectiveness of business graphics in meeting 
situations. The results were startling. In the group where visual 
aids were used; 

• Meetings were shorter: The study showed a 28% reduction in 
meeting length when transparencies were used. 

• Group consensus was faster: Agreement was reached by 79% of 
the group using transparencies, compared with only 8% among 
the control group using no visual aids. 

• The decision process was accelerated: 64% of study participants 
said they made their business decisions immediately after the vis- 
ual presentation. When overheads were not used, the control group 
said they delayed decision-making until some time after the group 



discussion following the presentation. 

• Presenters with visual aids were perceived as being more profes- 
sional, persuasive, credible and effective than those not using 
visual aids. 

Now, with the new HP 7475A Business Professional's Plotter, 
your meetings can have immediate and productive results like 
these. 

How the quality look 
of HP graphics can help 

The way you present your information can be equally as important 
as the actual information you're presenting. And that's where the 
new HP 7475A Business Professional's Plotter lets your profes- 
sionalism shine through. 

Standards unsurpassed in the 
plotter business 

The technical standards of the HP 7475A have no equal for pro- 
ducing quality graphics. With a resolution of one-thousandth-of-an- 
inch, curved lines are smooth, not jagged, and straight lines are 
consistently straight. Its exceptional repeatability (the ability of a 
pen to return precisely to a given point) assures that intersecting 
lines and circular shapes will meet exactly. The result is high-quality 
charts and graphs you'll be proud to present. 

Why 6 pens when experts say 4 will do? 

Graphics industry experts maintain that 
good graphics contain four colors per 
chart. But Hewlett-Packard goes the 
experts two better by providing a 
six-pen carousel, so you can 
store and use pens of different 
widths — thick pens for 
bold headings and thin 
pens for details. And 
with six pens, you 
won't have to 
waste valuable time 
changing them. That's 
important when "the 
boss wants to see your pre- 
sentation in twenty minutes!' 

With the HP 7475A, you also 
get automatic pen capping to pre- 
vent pens from drying out between 
uses, and special "pen damping" 
(gently lowering the pen to the paper or 
transparency) to increase pen life and ensure better line quality. . . 
use after use after use. You also get a rainbow of 10 colors to 
choose from, in two line widths. 

Your choice: 2 paper sizes and today's 
most popular graphics software packages 

While most professional business applications will be satisfied with 
standard 8'/2 x 11 " paper or transparencies, the HP 7475A adds the 




:an be the key to your success. 




capability of plotting on larger 11 x 
17" media, too. The larger plots are 
especially well-suited for time lines, 
PERT charts, schematics and engineering 
drawings. 

Best of all, you don't have to be a programmer 
to produce quality graphics on the HP 7475A. 
It's supported by a variety of professional graphics 
software packages for both HP and non-HP desktop 
and personal computers. 

Naturally, speaking of software compatibility leads us to 
hardware compatibility. . . . 

Compatible with almost any personal 
computer in the marketplace today 

With two interfaces available, the HP 7475A quickly "makes friends" 
with most models of today's most popular personal computers, 
including IBM® Apple,™ Compaq™ Osborne® and Commodore™ 
— as well as a host of HP computers. 

The cost? Surprisingly affordable 

The new HP 7475A Business Professional's Plotter is an amazingly 
affordable $1895. When you consider that a typical fee for a single 
five-color transparency from a graphics service is $50— and that 
the same transparency can be prepared for about $1 in materials 
on the HP 7475A — the return on your investment is almost 
immediate. 

Another choice: HP's low- cost, 
high performance 
Personal Computer Plotter 

For the "business on a budget^ you may also want a look at our 
2-pen Personal Computer Plotter, the 7470A. Its low cost (only 
$1095) is as remarkable as the quality of its plots. With many of 
the same features as the new HP 7475A, the HP 7470A plots 
on a single paper size (SVi x U"). It stores and caps two pens. 





and you can easily change the pens 
yourself for multi-color plotting. Best of 
all, the HP 7470A 2-pen plotter lets you 
turn your personal computer into a personal 
graphics workstation for only $1095.

has the correct contents of the physical disk sec- 
tor in memory, it can then place the new subsec- 
tor in its correct position in the buffer, leaving 
the remaining contents of the physical sector as 
they were. An actual disk write of the physical 
sector at this point, then, alters only the subsec- 
tor that BDOS wished to have altered. 

A BIOS like the one we've just described 
would ensure the integrity of the data on disk, 
but since both a read and write must be per- 
formed for each write, it would be abysmally 
slow. If a BIOS of this sort were the only op- 
tion, single density would probably still be the 
primary storage format. Luckily, at the expense 
of making the BIOS slightly longer and more 
complex, this problem can be overcome. This is 
done by delaying most write operations untU we 
are actually sure that BDOS is going to change 
physical sectors, tracks, or drives. 

The BIOS, then, handles writes in the follow- 
ing way. On the very first write, BIOS checks 
to see if the subsector to be written corresponds 
to the physical sector, track, and drive that were 
last read or written to. If the subsectors are in 
fact the same, the BIOS knows that the physical 
sector buffer in memory inside itself contains the 
correct data from disk. BIOS then accepts the 
subsector from BDOS, places it in the buffer in 
its appropriate place, and sets a special flag. This 
flag indicates that there is now valid data in the 
buffer that BDOS thinks has already been writ- 
ten to disk. No disk access has been made at this 
point, so the flag is necessary to ensure that the 
physical sector buffer will eventually get written. 



# T A I 1^ 

If, on the other hand, the subsector had not 
matched the last physical sector, track, and drive, 
BIOS would have known that the buffer did not 
contain the correct physical sector. Since this is 
our first write, we'll assume that the buffer con- 
tains no valid data at all (the flag is not set). Since 
the buffer contains no physical sector, the BIOS 
must read into the buffer the physical sector con- 
taining the subsector that BDOS is trying to write. 
From here on, the process is the same as if the 
physical sectors had matched: BIOS accepts the 
subsector, places it in the buffer, and sets the 
flag to show that valid unwritten data now re- 
sides in the buffer. 

On subsequent writes, then, when BIOS 
checks the flag, the flag will show that the buff- 
er is valid. If the current subsector to be written 
is in the same physical sector as the subsector in 
the buffer, BIOS will simply keep placing subsec- 
tors into the buffer, setting the flag, and return- 
ing to BDOS. If the physical sectors do not 
match, however, then BIOS must write out the 
physical sector buffer to disk before doing 
anything else. Then it must preread the new 
physical sector, and finally it must get the new 
subsector from the location supplied by BDOS 
(somewhere in user memory) and place it in the 
buffer, setting the buffer-active flag once more. 

While complex to implement, the process just 
described usually results in a significant increase 
in disk access speed. The reason for this is sim- 
ple: The time-consuming portion of disk access 
is the actual time spent by the software and hard- 
ware in manipulating the drive. Since block-

read into memory for every access of the disk, 
most data transfer is between memory buffers — a 
much faster process. With single-density formats, 
in which no block/deblock takes place, all data 
transfer involves actual disk access, and the 
resulting degradation of performance is readily 
apparent. A constant increase in performance at 
the expense of a one-time increase in complexi- 
ty seems a good trade. For that reason, yet 
another complex feature was installed — namely, 
different treatment of different types of write 
operations. 

Most blocking/deblocking BIOS installations 
distinguish between different types of writes. To 
see why, take the preread that BIOS must per- 
form as an example. This preread is really only 
necessary when the physical sector on the disk 
contains valid information. Obviously, when 
areas that are not currently allocated to files are 
being written to, the preread can be skipped. To 
increase performance, then, we should at least 
be able to differentiate between writes to allocated 
and unallocated areas of the disk. It must also 
be possible to separate out a write operation to 
the directory. 

As we have seen, BDOS deals with only one 
directory file entry at a time, holding it in 
memory and modifying it as the file is being 
modified. Only when BDOS has finished modi- 
fying the file (or file portion) described in that 
entry does it write the entry back to the direc- 
tory on disk. It then creates or reads a new entry 
before going off to write more information in the 
file. It should be obvious from this fact that there 
will seldom be a time when more than one sub- 
sector will be written to the same physical sec- 
tor without a normal file write occurring in be- 
tween. Since the only reason we postpone writes 
is to capitalize on situations in which more than 
one subsector is to be written in one place, it is 
apparent that directory writes do not need to be 
postponed. 

We now know that we can increase perform- 
ance by knowing whether a write is to be made 
to an unallocated area, to an allocated area, or 
to the directory. Luckily, BDOS is equipped to 
provide this information. Each time it calls the 
BIOS write routine, register [C] contains a 0 for 
a normal sector write, a 1 for a write to the direc- 
tory, or a 2 for the first write to an unallo- 
cated area. 

Obviously, the allocated and unallocated areas 
we've been talking about here are the allocation 
blocks that BDOS uses to divide up the disk, since 
BDOS has no idea what physical sector sizes are 
in use. In reality, each allocation block normal- 
ly contains several physical sectors, and we could 
improve performance still further if we could 
avoid prereads on the write to any unallocated 
physical sector instead of just to the first sector 
in an unallocated block. This has been done in 
the SoftCard BIOS, as we shall see later. 

The BIOS, then, must be made capable of dif- 
ferentiating between unallocated writes (2), which 
it can do without prereads; normal sector writes 
(0), which require a preread on the first subsec- 
tor; and directory writes (1), which always require 
prereads and must be written immediately. In its

alteration guide. Digital Research provides sam- 
ple disk I/O routines that implement blocking and 
deblocking to go with its sample BIOS for the 
Intel MDS development system. While many 
people have had success using these routines, 
others have criticized them as flawed or ineffi- 
cient. Without entering into the controversy, it 
is safe to say that most BIOS installations in 
operation today use the basic algorithm provid- 
ed by Digital but modify it to allow optimum ac- 
tivity in a particular computer system. 

In the SoftCard BIOS, blocking and deblock- 
ing are performed to translate the Apple's 
256-byte physical sectors into 128-byte subsec- 
tors. A modified form of Digital's algorithm is 
used, and duplication of hardware (or RWTS) 
control routines has been avoided as much as 
possible. The read/ write code has several com- 
ponents. First, there's the physical sector buffer 
(also called the host buffer), appropriately named 
HSTBUF. Located at 0F800H, HSTBUF is 
simply a 256-byte page of RAM used as the 
source for all write operations to the disk and as 
the destination of all disk read operations. Next 
are two routines designed to get a physical sec- 
tor from the disk or to put one on the disk; these 
are known as READHST and WRITEHST 
respectively . 

READHST reads a physical sector into the 
host buffer, while WRITEHST writes the host 
buffer to the disk. In actuality, the code that calls 
RWTS and checks for errors is used by both 
routines; these routines simply load the type of 
command (read or write) into register [A] for 
RWTS. READHST goes on to execute the com- 
mon routine. WRITEHST, which is in memory 
ahead of READHST, sets up things for a write 
and then skips the portion of READHST that 
loads the read command. 

So far, then, we have a host buffer for stor- 
ing physical sectors and routines that read and 
write between that buffer and the disk. If BDOS 
were capable of dealing with 256 bytes at a time, 
we'd have all we needed. Now, however, we 
need routines that, by moving data between user 
memory and the buffer, simulate for BDOS disk 
reads and writes of 128-byte subsectors. As if that 
weren't enough, these routines must also manage 
the host buffer, writing it out and refilling it when 
necessary, while optimizing the entire operation 
for speed. This is no simple task. 

The first thing to be done is to set up a method 
of keeping track of the disk location (the 
drive/track/sector) that corresponds to the con- 
tents of the host buffer. This ensures that we'll 
always know where the buffer goes when the time 
comes to write it out. What happens, though, 
when BDOS requests that a new drive be 
selected? Do we always write out the host 
buffer? If so, the method we've devised won't 
be very efficient, since BDOS may select a new 
drive without ever accessing it and may come 
back afterward to access the very same sector we 
had in the host buffer. 

The way to avoid this problem is to keep two 
sets of disk location variables. The host set always 
shows the disk location of the contents of the host 
buffer. The names of these variables usually start 
with HST. The variables in the other set, called 



the seek variables, are used to store the drive, 
track, and sector being selected by BDOS. Their 
names usually start with SEK. Since resetting the 
seek variables does not alter the host set, we don't 
need to write out the host buffer whenever one 
of the seek variables is changed. It's not until 
BDOS actually requests a read or write that we 
even need to worry about the host buffer. This 
is one case in which waiting until the last minute 
makes things more efficient. 

In essence, then, we let BDOS do all the 
changing of the seek variables that it wants to- 
calling SELDSK, HOME, SETSEC, and 
SETTRK. Then, when BDOS has finally set up 
everything to its satisfaction and calls READ or 
WRITE, we examine the seek variables and com- 
pare them to the host variables. If the host 
variables match the seek variables, we know that 
we already have the proper sector in the host 
buffer. If BDOS has requested a read, we take 
the appropriate part of the buffer and put it in 
memory where BDOS has told us to; if, on the 
other hand, BDOS has requested a write, we 
move the subsector fi-om user memory to the ap- 
propriate part of the host buffer. Since no disk 
accesses had to be made, this operation is very 
fast. Had there been no match, things would have 
been slightly more complicated. We would have 
known, for example, that this situation might re- 
quire that a new physical sector be read into the 
host buffer or possibly that a new subsector be 
moved from user memory into the buffer. In 
either case the result would be the trashing of the 
buffer's current contents. The first thing we need 
to do, then, is to see if the buffer contains valid 
unwritten data. 

We do this by means of two flags, HBFACT 
and SECMOD. The former is a sign that the host 
buffer contains active data, which is to say that 
the data in the buffer is in fact an actual physical 
sector corresponding to the disk location iden- 
tified by the host variables. The SECMOD flag 
is similar but indicates that the host buffer has 
been modified by data being moved into it from 
user memory. In other words, a subsector that 
BDOS thinks was written to disk has been 
moved into the host buffer but has not yet been 
actually written on the disk. 

Let's see how these flags respond during 
operation. Three operating conditions merit ex- 
amination: BDOS requesting a read, BDOS re- 
questing a normal write, and BDOS requesting 
a write to an unallocated area (a directory write 
is always treated as a normal write for the pur- 
poses of the flags). 

For a BDOS read, the host buffer will always 
be filled with what is actually on the disk. 
HBFACT, then, will be set nonzero to show that 
the host buffer contains valid data from the disk 
location shown in the host variables. SECMOD, 
however, will be nonzero, since no alteration of 
the host buffer has been made. 

An unallocated write by BDOS means that no 
preread of the actual disk contents needs to be 
made. HBFACT is still set to nonzero, though, 
since the host buffer will be filled with a valid 
subsector of data and the host variables have been 
set up to identify the disk location to which the 
data belongs. SECMOD in this case is also set

nonzero, since the actual disk contents have not 
yet been updated to match the host buffer. 

Finally, a normal write by BDOS means that 
a preread must be made to get the current disk 
contents into the host buffer before moving in the 
subsector. In this case, the buffer contains valid 
data and the host variables point to the correct 
disk location, so HBFACT will be nonzero. Since 
the subsector has been moved into the host 
buffer after the preread, the buffer no longer 
matches the disk contents; therefore, SECMOD 
will also be nonzero. By using these flags and 
comparing the host and seek variables, the BIOS 
can always determine the current state of the host 
buffer and from that can determine whether the 
host buffer must be filled, written to disk, or both 



prior to the next operation. 

We'll call the HBFACT and SECMOD flags 
status flags or state flags; they're called this 
because they show the status of a specific object, 
in this case the host buffer. Several other flags 
are used in the BIOS read/write code. We'll call 
them action flags, since they are used to indicate 
to routines executed later on that some sp)ecific 
action is to be performed. 

The three action flags in use in the SoftCard 
BIOS are called READOP, WRTYPE, and 
RSFLAG. As its name implies, READOP is set 
to nonzero to indicate that this is a read opera- 
tion, or cleared to zero to indicate a write opera- 
tion. WRTYPE is used to store the value that 
BDOS passes to the WRITE routine to indicate

the type of write (0, 1, or 2) to be performed. 
Finally, RSFLAG is used to indicate that a 
preread is necessary when set nonzero, or that 
no preread is necessary when cleared to zero. 

Using these five flags, it is possible to create 
one routine that can essentially control 
everything— performing straight reads, writes 
with prereads, or writes without prereads— all 
while keeping track of the host buffer and filling 
it and writing it out as necessary. This common 
routine is called RWOPER. It is from this routine 
that READHST and WRITEHST are called as 
necessary to fill or empty the host buffer. 
RWOPER also handles the movement of subsec- 
tors between user memory and the host buffer 
in response to BDOS read and write requests. 
RWOPER is entered from either the READ 
routine or the WRITE routine after one of these 
routines has initialized the three action flags to 
suit the specific process RWOPER is to perform. 
In turn, RWOPER is reponsible for setting the 
two status flags each time it changes the status 
of the host buffer. 

There's one other significant piece of code 
contained within the WRITE routine. It is called 
CHKUNA, and it is responsible for handling the 
setting of the action flag RSFLAG. CHKUNA 
is the mpns to accomplish the goal we spoke of 
earlier— to allow all physical sectors in an 
unallocated data block to be written without 
prereads. It does this by keeping its own set of 
disk location variables, called the unallocated 
variables (this time all starting with UNA). When 
the first write to an unallocated data block oc- 
curs, CHKUNA recognizes this fact by the write- 
type value of 2 passed by BDOS in register [C] . 
At this point it loads a counter variable with 8, 
the number of subsectors in an allocation block. 
CHKUNA also sets all of the unallocated 
variables to equal the seek variables. It further 
clears RSFLAG to zero so that no preread will 
be done. Before going to RWOPER, though, it 
decrements the counter of unallocated subsectors 
and then increments the subsector number in its 
allocation variables for next time. 

If the next operation is a write, and it is to 
the very next subsector, then CHKUNA notices 
that the write-type is 0, meaning a write to an 
allocated area. First it checks the counter to see 
if any unallocated subsectors remain in this block. 
If not, it knows that this is a real write to an 
allocated area. If some are left, CHKUNA com- 
pares the seek variables for drive, track, and sec- 
tor to its unallocated variables (remember that it 
incremented the subsector number) and finds that 
they match. It then knows that it is still in the 
unallocated data block and that a preread is not 
yet necessary. RSFLAG is cleared to zero to in- 
dicate that there's no preread, the unallocated sec- 
tor counter is decremented, and the unallocated 
subsector number is incremented once more for 
next time before control passes to RWOPER. 
We'll get a clearer picmre of how this operates 
when we examine the actual routine. For now, 
suffice it to say that a substantial increase in speed 
is the result. 

Next time we'll examine the various routines 
in step-by-step fashion as we have the other BIOS 
functions. Until next month. ...

Nothing, it seems, grows faster than a new- 
born baby. Nothing, that is, except maybe a 
software publishing house whose commitment 
to producing high-quality products earns it a 
positive reputation among users and com- 
petitors alike. Babies require a lot of nurturing 
and care, a lot of love and hard work. The same 
ingredients are called for whatever the progeny 
if the venture is to be a success. 

Bob and Ann Clardy had been supplying 
these essentials to their business, Synergistic 
Software, for almost four years when Softalk 
first told their story in the May 1982 issue. At 
that time, another beneficiary of this tried-and- 



true approach was the Clardys' young son, 
Derek. Baby and business have been growing at 
a geometric rate ever since. Derek, who's now 
two years old, already has his own set of disks, 
labeled with his name. And the growth of the 
company has put the Clardys at a crossroads as 
software publishers. 

When first starting out, the Clardys con- 
ceived of software publishing as a three-month 
trial affair. Bob Clardy had been working swing 
shift designing radar systems at a Boeing plant 
in the Seattle area when friends and fellow 
members of the Apple PugetSound Program Li- 
brary Exchange (A.P.P.L.E.) encouraged him 



to try to market a couple of games he had writ- 
ten in his spare time. Clardy originally in- 
troduced his programming efforts to these 
friends in 1979, in the form of the game 
Dungeon Campaign. In Clardy 's first foray into 
selling his wares, this game was teamed on a 
single disk with another. Wilderness Campaign, 
which integrated hi-res graphics. The latter, 
now eminently collectible, was the first outdoor 
fantasy role-playing game for the Apple. 

Hopeful but cautious, the Clardys had their 
confidence bolstered when the initial cash flow 
generated from sales of their first disk far ex- 
ceeded their expectations. Given the name sug- 
gested by Ann Clardy's father. Synergistic Soft- 
ware was bom. When the company proceeded 
to grow at a pace typical of a newborn, Clardy 
quit his job at Boeing. As he developed more 
programs. Synergistic's sales grew too, re- 
flecting an insatiable appetite among microcom- 
puter users for good game programs. 

In November 1979, the Clardys began 
marketing Higher Graphics. Written by Bob 
Clardy, the program was one of the first graphic 
utility programs available for the Apple. That 
success was followed by another. Modifiable 
Database, the best of the two or three database 
management programs available in early 1980. 
At a time when there were few programming 
tools on the market, Synergistic released Pro- 
gram Line Editor, written by then-seventeen- 
year-old Neil Konzen, with whom Clardy had 
become friends through A.P.P.L.E. get- 
togethers. 

Then came the Fifth Annual West Coast 
Computer Faire in San Francisco. It brought 
praise for Synergistic's products, and it sparked 
a series of inspired programming efforts by 
Clardy. Foremost among the releases to follow 
was the hi-res animated fantasy game Odyssey: 
The Compleat Apventure, originally written in 
Integer Basic and made available in Applesoft in 
1981. Being a dungeon master in college en- 
abled Clardy to bring a thorough knowledge of 
fantasy role-playing games to this creation. The 
adventure consists of three separate but in- 
terlocking programs. Unlike most fantasy 
games of the time, Odyssey accepts a number of 
different routes toward the goal without trap- 
ping the player or necessitating the retracing of 
steps. 

Similarly, Synergistic's diversity of product 
reflects the many different paths to be explored

Opposite page: Two-year-old Derek Clardy, looking very much like arn up-and-coming software executive, pauses for a milk break between bouts

in software marketing. Synergistic's utilities 
have included Soft Seventy, which provides 
software-based seventy-column capability; 
G.A.P. (Game Animation Package); an Integer 
Basic compiler; and the enhanced Global Pro- 
gram Line Editor. Educational software from 
Synergistic has included The Linguist, a 
skeleton language translation and tutorial pro- 
gram; The Communicator, a speed typing and 
reading program; and The Planetary Guide, 
which teaches basic astronomy in hi-res. Syner- 
gistic's business packages and game offerings, 
both fantasy and arcade, have been even more 
extensive. 

In 1981, Modifiable Database was updated 
to become The Data Reporter, a database 
management system. The program features 
report generation with data plotting and analysis 
capabilities that can be used in inventory con- 
trol, accounts receivable, sales analysis, and as 
a bibliographic or memo reference tool. Other 
business programs include Higher Text, Higher 
Text //, Inventory Manager, and Word Weaver 
III, a word processor for the Apple HI. 

Synergistic has shown an exceptional knack 
for developing a range of challenging scenario 
concepts and inventive, fast-action situations. In 
addition to Odyssey, players have enjoyed Cam- 
paign Trilogy, Apventure to Atlantis, Procyon 
Warrior, Nightmare Gallery, Escape from Arc- 
turus, and, more recently, Crisis Mountain, 
Bolo, and Microbe. 

But now things are changing for Synergistic. 
As Bob Clardy sees it, given the way the market 
is evolving, a software company faces a crucial 
choice at a certain point in its success curve. It 



can either continue to grow, making gains as a 
software publisher through the infusion of ven- 
ture capital by outside investors — a necessity for 
most companies to survive amid the onslaught 
of the biggies— or it can get out of the publish- 
ing game completely. This is the choice Clardy 
has made for Synergistic. But what does that 
really mean? Can we expect never again to see 
the unique approach and quality of design we've 
come to expect from the software produced by 
Clardy and crew? No way! 

Synergistic is getting out of software pub- 
lishing—it's true. Instead, the company is be- 
coming an organization of authors who'll con- 
centrate full-time on program development, 
free of the time-consuming concerns entailed in 
publishing. The arrangement should result in 
many more and exciting products coming from 
the Synergistic team. 

Negotiating with other publishers who will 
begin to assume distribution of Synergistic's 
past releases has been the first item on Clardy 's 
agenda for the future. Synergistic will also be 
converting programs to run on systems other 
than those for which they were originally 
designed. This will include products generated 
elsewhere as well as their own. 

So far, it is certain that GPLE will 
henceforth be produced by Beagle Bros and that 
Crisis Mountain for the Apple will be marketed 
by the Micro Fun division of Micro Lab. Other 
popular Synergistic games and business 
packages will be converted for use on the whole 
array of microcomputers now available, with 
many different publishers involved. The Japa- 
nese publishing rights to a version of The Data 



Reporter written for the IBM Personal Com- 
puter have already been sold to Hitachi to run 
on that company's hardware — in Japanese, of 
course. 

In spite of all the wheeling and dealing that 
Synergistic's realignment of efforts has re- 
quired, Clardy and cohorts exhibit tremendous 
enthusiasm for the task of creatively applying 
their progranuning talents. New arcade and fan- 
tasy games are already being developed, many 
of which strive to present an environment in 
which the player interacts with the game in a 
more natural way. In a fantasy adventure game, 
for example, players won't necessarily be tied 
to a fixed set of circumstances but may be 
presented with a multitude of options within that 
game's universe. Or perhaps a better solution to 
a problem, or means of achieving a goal, will 
exist independent of the one provided for by the 
programmer. In other words, players will be 
devising their own unique, creative solutions as 
they play. 

Synergistic's commitment to quality control 
as an essential element in the development of 
new products is in no danger — especially since 
the bottom line in that area is monitored by Ann 
Clardy. Her husband describes her as a profes- 
sional user — someone who knows little about 
programming but has a sure-fire talent for 
unearthing the kinds of bugs that users could 
find objectionable. Little Derek Clardy clocks 
in his time as a junior professional user of sorts, 
too. His latest object of scrutiny is Dino Eggs, 
which occupies him for hours with its entertain- 
ing animation and amusing sound effects. 

In the end, which publisher releases the new

programs developed by the Synergistic family 
isn't the most important issue. The most telling 
quality in any game or business package re- 
mains the degree to which that program's 
design reflects its developer's concern for the 
user. In Synergistic's case, that issue has never 
been in question. 

Families as a Professional Concern. About 
one hundred fifty miles east and south of the 
Seattle suburb that Synergistic calls home, 
beyond the mighty Cascade range, near where 
the Columbia and Snake rivers meet, lie the tri- 
cities of Pasco, Kennewick, and Richland, 
Washington. Here, since 1981, Apples have 
been making a big difference to a group of 
social service workers who minister to local 
families and individuals in need. 

An often transient labor force in and out of 
work at the nearby Hanford Federal Nuclear 
Reservation comprises a major segment of this 
region's population. Lutheran Social Services 
in Kennewick (whose story Softalk first told in 
May 1982) offers an array of services on a 
sliding-fee scale, aimed primarily at helping 
families cope with stressful situations and the 
experience of rootlessness not uncommon in 
such communities. Whether conducting family 
workshops, doing outpatient counseling, or ad- 
ministering programs dealing with divorce, 
adoption placement, and crisis intervention, the 
Lutheran Social Services staff has found that 



having Apple power has helped them serve peo- 
ple better. 

When Softalk spoke to area director Dan 
Haygeman originally, he had just discovered 
how helpful Zardax could be in coping with the 
voluminous word processing problems that 
developing funding proposals for his nonprofit 
agency presented. He had also discovered the 
worth of Bob Clardy's Odyssey: The Compleat 
Apventure as a counseling tool. 

Haygeman had on occasion played board 
games with young clients as a way of reconnect- 
ing with them during sessions in which com- 
munication had bogged down. "None of those 
games have anywhere near the emotional appeal 
of playing a computer game," states Hayge- 
man. He says the types of choices players make 
in a fantasy /adventure context can be indicative 
of "where they're at" and are of value as con- 
versation starters, springboards that may get a 
young person talking about feelings and self. 

As of this year, a He has joined the Plus and 
NEC 5510 Spinwriter in serving the nine- 
member full-time staff, which includes 
counselors and clerical personnel. Haygeman 
continues to extol the virtues of Zardax for its 
ease of use — it's taken only about an hour for 
computer-illiterate staff members to learn to use 
the program for such things as follow-up cor- 
respondence with clients or clinical writing ap- 
plications. He especially appreciates the print- 




spooling option, which takes advantage of the 
lie's extra 64K and is available for no additional 
charge. 

In addition, client data is now being man- 
aged using Sierra On-Line's General Manager, 
which permits conversion of its records to stan- 
dard DOS text files for printing by Zardax. 
Haygeman also finds VisiCalc an essential tool 
in the development of grant proposals, which 
often require making projections to determine 
the impact of client load upon the agency's 
budget. 

The Apple is also employed in the process- 
ing of data gleaned from clients' responses to 
the Leary Interpersonal Checklist, a diagnostic 
measuring device that evaluates both the way 
individuals perceive themselves and how others 
perceive them. The version of the checklist the 
agency uses was developed for microcom- 
puters by Dr. Michael Nugent of Tacoma, 
Washington. Haygeman customized it by add- 
ing a response plotting algorithm that he 
developed with Bob Scherpeld, a local pro- 
grammer who volunteered to help. Written in 
Applesoft, this portion of the program plots 
clients' responses to the checklist on a circular 
two-dimensional grid, graphically portraying 
the interpersonal perceptions and self- 
perceptions of the individuals involved. In 
clinical situations where interpersonal under- 
standing might require a greater investment of 
time and money than a client could accom- 
modate, using a tool such as this may bring 
meaningful progress more quickly. 

The shrinking of available funding for social 
services nationwide has placed an additional 
burden on those responsible for maintaining 
quality service in the helping professions. "The 
voluntary sector is just not able to fill the gap," 
says Haygeman. He feels this is but a com- 
pounding strain on those who, by the very 
nature of their work, have embraced a vocation 
already fraught with so much stress. His solu- 
tion is to try to find creative ways to do more 
with less. The Chinese character for crisis, he 
recalls, waxing philosophical, is a combination 
of two others: one that means danger and one 
that means opportunity. For him this represents 
the insight that threatening situations will often 
spark a positive change that might not otherwise 
have been made. Thus were the circumstances 
surrounding his original Apple purchase a cou- 
ple of years back— an opportunity he seized and 
from which many continue to benefit. 

A Friend to Those in Need. Back in 1980 a 
black Bell and Howell Apple at the Lincoln 
School for educationally and physically han- 
dicapped children in Boise, Idaho, started help- 
ing Leslie Evans express her outgoing and 
cheerful personality a little more easily. In 
1980, at age sixteen, Leslie was an active honor 
student who loved to ride horseback. One day 
she was thrown from her horse, and her fall 
resulted in an extremely physically handi- 
capping condition. 

Leslie's story was featured in Softalk's June 




As a counselor of families and social services 
administrator, Dan Haygeman discovered that 
the Apple could save both time and money for 
an agency and its clients in need.

1981 issue— that's a little over a year after she 
was first introduced to the computer. A friend 
who worked at a local computer store had 
organized a fund-raising drive, through the 
Boise Statesman, that brought Leslie a home 
computer. 

The Apple's contribution to Leslie's life has 
been primarily as a means of communication 
and self-expression. Leslie is unable to walk or 
speak, but she can hold a stylus and use it to 
type. Leslie still relies primarily on a single 
communication program, Microcommunicator 
Version C, written for the handicapped by Grant 
Grober and adapted especially for her. Now 
recently turned twenty-one, Leslie graduated 
from Lincoln last May. The school's work with 
handicapped students and Apples goes on. 
Jim Schnur, a consulting teacher at Lincoln, 



Authoring System, developed at the California 
School for the Deaf by a deaf person. This pro- 
gram has been used extensively at Lincoln in a 
class that teaches survival skills, such as how to 
read signs and how to anticipate or deal with 
potentially dangerous situations. 

Besides providing all the elements of a com- 
plete authoring program, this package contains 
a graphics library of eight hundred to nine hun- 
dred images that a teacher can insert in various 
ways into a composition, thereby enhancing the 
level of interest a subject might hold for the 
students. Among the images available in the 
program is the alphabet in finger-spelling. {The 
Blocks System, version 3.2, is available through 
the Softswap educators' exchange service, San 
Mateo Office of Education, 333 Main Street, 
Redwood City, CA 94063.) 



Then the Social Security rehabilitation program 
that sponsored the lessons dropped l^slie from 
its rolls, deeming her a bad employment risk 
further down the line. 

When summer came, Leslie had summer 
camp to look forward to. This was the ff)urth 
year she had gone for the one-week outing in 
McCall, Idaho, sponsored by United Cerebral 
Palsy and staffed by volunteers from the nearby 
Mountain Home Air Force Base. Afterward, 
Leslie wrote a piece about her experience at 
camp for the cerebral palsy newsletter. A high 
point of the week for Leslie was horseback 
riding, which she loves. The experience was 
made possible by having someone else ride with 
her on the horse. An avid equestrian before her 
accident, I^eslie also enjoyed a visit with the 
bareback riding club she used to belong to, and

was instrumental in introducing Leslie and 
fellow students to microcomputers. When the 
school acquired its first Apple, Schnur recalls, 
many people couldn't see the point of using a 
microcomputer in the school setting. Today, the 
school owns five Apples, shared by students 
and faculty, which are used in classrooms. 

Schnur has worked with Lincoln vocational 
coordinator Kathy Jones in the development of a 
food service program. This program is used in a 
small cafe that's located in the school and 
staffed by the less handicapped students. One 
feature of the program helps the student staff 
with counting change, often a major ac- 
complishment for the developmentally disabled 
or for those with limited reading skills. Each 
day, students can enter the data describing the 
menu selections for that day and the computer 
prints it out. 

Teachers use other programs in their various 
classes, the most valuable of which is the Blocks 



Though the use of micros has far-reaching 
implications for bettering the lives of the han- 
dicapped and assisting those who work with 
them, in Leslie Evans's case the computer 
wasn't the miracle her family had hoped it 
would be. As Leslie's mother observes, the Ap- 
ple has been a lifesaver as a tool, just by allow- 
ing Leslie the basic communication abilities. 
But that's only a start for this young woman 
whose handicap is so severe that holding her 
head up or swallowing can be a major effort. 

This past spring a teacher came to her home 
to work with Leslie for an hour a week. The 
teacher, Steve Muffley, whom Leslie's mother 
describes as "a brilliant young man," has 
cerebral palsy, with no use of his arms or voice. 
From his electric wheelchair, by typing on the 
Apple keyboard with a stylus that he holds in his 
mouth, he showed Leslie how to use Bank 
Street Writer. The process was slow-moving 
and hard, but the two were making progress. 



she saw them perform when her family traveled 
in their van to a local rodeo. 

Recently, through the Elks Rehabilitation 
Hospital in Boise where l^slie attends therapy 
sessions two days each week, she acquired a 
slider device that makes it possible for her to 
feed disks into the drive by herself. Leslie's 
mother now hopes to find a method whereby 
Leslie will be able to turn the computer on and 
off by herself too. The one limiting factor to 
adapting the computer to accommodate Leslie 
better has been a lack of resources in that region 
of the country— both resources for the han- 
dicapped and resources for ordinary computer 
users are hard to come by in Idaho. 

In spite of all she's had to contend with, 
Leslie retains a cheerful spirit and an optimistic 
attitude. The Apple helps a lot because Leslie 
Evans loves to write— stories, poems, letters, 
anything. The Apple helps to create a bridge 
between her active mind and the world. Ji 



Good news for Apple 
New, easier-to-use programs 
And you won't have tc 



If you're like most personal computer users, 
you're not using your computer as mucin as you 
expected to.

Zen and the Art of Raster Graphics 

We now consider the 53,760 dots on the Apple II high-resolution 
graphics display. Each of those dots can be turned on or ojf independent- 
ly of all the others, which means that there are at least 2"-'^^ (or 
I0i6.is3j possible distinct images on an Apple screen. Out of this enor- 
mous number, we wish to find those very special patterns that educate, 
clarify, or entertain. Our task, then, is to develop methods for controlling 
our dots, to turn them on and off in ways that are good. In spiritual 
terms, we seek the Buddha as He manifests Himself in dots. 

— Swami Mahareeshi Bujramdas, ancient master 

The field of computer graphics is well established, and microcomput- 
er graphics occupies only a small and relatively minor part of it. The 
problems that researchers are currently interested in concern the genera- 
tion of extremely realistic images on very high-resolution displays. You 
can see the results of such work in the special effects of such movies as 
Iron, Star Trek, and Star Wars. 

Graphics, the Fuial Frontier. Now what does Star Wars have to do 
with Apple computer graphics? Unfortunately, not much. Anything we 
do on the Apple II is going to seem primitive compared to the state of the 
art. While the wizards at Lucasfilm, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and 
the New York Institute of Technology explore fractals, models of reflec- 
tion, and VLSI architecture for computer graphics hardware, we can on- 
ly hope to learn some of the fundamental techniques. At least for 
now. . . . 

The constraints imposed by our little Apple II computer are some- 
times formidable and can seem crushing to people used to working on 
bigger computers. Yet we usually demand a higher degree of interac- 
tivity from the spreadsheets, word processors, and video games that we 
run on our Apple computer than from the equivalent programs running 
on minicomputers or mainframes. 

This situation presents us with an impossible and therefore worth- 
while challenge. To meet this challenge — to create great graphics on our 
screen— we must find the most efficient methods for creating images on 
the screen and implement them effectively in software. Of primary im- 
portance is the design of the methods, or algorithms. If we are working 
from faulty or inefficient algorithms, even the greatest coding virtuosity 



won't save us. Good programming skills are also important, however, as 
many good algorithms have been smothered under layers of bad code. 

We do have a few things going for us. Since the Apple is a personal 
computer, we don't have to share it with anyone. We have that 6502 
microprocessor and its memory all to ourselves, and we can make our 
own rules. Rule 1: We will do everything we can to make our programs 
run fast. 

And as we wUl discover, the architecture of our Apple is particularly 
well suited for fast and interactive graphics. One of the most critical fac- 
tors in the speed of graphics operations is the interface between the cen- 
tral processor (in our case, the 6502) and the dots on the screen. We can 
thank Steve Wozniak, the Apple's designer, for making this interface 
simple and fast. At maximum, we can change the screen at a rate of 
seven dots every four milliseconds, for a communication speed of 1.75 
Mbaud. That is very, very fast. 

Because implementation issues are so important on microcomputers, 
this column will sometimes be as much about programming as it is about 
computer graphics. Most people find the basic ideas behind computer 
graphics to be natural and intuitive, but the details of implementing those 
ideas can be a little more mystifying. For that reason, we'll direct our at- 
tention to programming problems every once in a while. This is where a 
lot of people seem to get stuck. 

This column is meant as an introduction to computer graphics, so 
we'll start out learning to draw some fairly simple kinds of objects. We'll 
begin with the simplest ones, such as rectangles and lines, and work our 
way up to circles and polygons. We'll also find out what bit maps are and 
how to draw them on the screen. Finally, we'll learn about graphical 
operations like windowing, clipping, rotation, translation, and scaling. 
One thing we'll learn is that being able to draw these simple objects and 
perform a few operations on them can take us a long way. 

One thing we'll try to avoid is a slant in the coverage toward using 
graphics in any particular type of application program. Thus, what is 
written here should be of as much interest to the word processor designer 
as it is to the video game hacker. With the explosion of graphics-related 
user interfaces like joysticks, trackballs, and bit pads, all the way up to 
the mouse on Apple's Lisa, programmers need to be able to blast those 
dots for all sorts of applications. 

So far, so good. But now we must face an unpleasant consideration.

OCTOBER 1983 



We want to write some programs to test our ideas. What language should 
we use to implement the programs? There is nothing inherent in graphics 
that requires us to do anything in assembly language. We could just as 
easily use Pascal or Basic. The reason we won't is that these languages 
run too slowly on a microcomputer like the Apple. Since graphical 
operations change large amounts of screen data and tend to get used a lot, 
it's important that they run quickly. 

Using assembly language is no guarantee, however, that a program 
will run quickly enough. Some applications like real time flight simula- 
tion are so demanding that even the best software must be supplemented 
with special-purpose digital hardware if the graphics are to be generated 
at the required rate. 

The Call of the Hacker's Code. We can't afford to build special - 
purpose hardware, but, as it turns out, we don't need it. We can 
draw polygons or aliens as fast as we need to by using software alone, as 
long as our designs are good and we pull every trick in the book to make 
our code run fast. Programming tricks (or hacks, as they are sometimes 
called) are not very respectable in the computer science world, but pull- 
ing these tricks is a lot of fun and can actually become an art in itself. 
Hacks will definitely be a topic in this column. 

So we will be programming at the lowest software level available on 
the Apple. While there are a number of excellent books on assembly, it's 
still the hard way to program, even if you aren't trying to be tricky. It 
will be assumed in this column that you know something about assembly 
language and the hexadecimal number system. If you do, you might be 
able to understand and even modify the program listings. If you don't, 
you should still be able to read the column when it deals with computer 
graphics. Just skip the sections marked with an asterisk, which dwell on 
low-level implementation issues. And take comfort in this: Assembly 
language is for nerds. 

(* For assembly wizards only: All other programming languages are 
for nerds.) 

It would be nice if, after reading this series, we came away with more 
than just the experience of having read it. Therefore, this column has 
been carefully organized. Over a period of time, a complete set of pro- 



grams will be developed. At the end of the series you will be able to use 
these programs as a self-contained package to implement your own 
graphics programs. 

More Unpleasantness. We need an editor and assembler in order to 
write this graphics package. At the risk of angering every software pub- 
lisher who puts out an assembler, we won't recommend anyone's prod- 
uct, since each one has some fatal flaw. There seem to be two separate 
schools on the design of editor/assemblers. The "leftist" school be- 
lieves in simple assemblers with limited editing capabilities, while the 
"rightists" create complex systems with every feature imaginable. The 
problem is that the left-wing products, while flexible and very fast, make 
editing a frustrating task. This is bad, since most programming time is 
spent editing. The right-wing systems usually have editors with more 
features, but the user interfaces are complex and unforgiving. What's 
more, assemblies can take forever with the more complicated assem- 
blers, and you find that some of the things you want to do are prohibited 
and won't assemble. 

To remain nonpartisan, the listings in this column will be in the for- 
mat required for Apple's Edasm editor/assembler. This product is readi- 
ly available, well supported, and comes in standard DOS 3.3 form, so it 
can be used with RAM-based pseudodisks and hard disks. It's fast and 
has a reasonable line-oriented editor, and the latest version works great 
with the lie. The current DOS Tool Kit contains this assembler plus the 
Bugbyter debugger, making the package a powerful set of tools for 
developing assembly language programs. 

One final note. The listings that go with this column will be long, and 
it doesn't make much sense for everybody to have to retype them; so a 
disk will be provided containing the complete set of source and object 
files. You'll have to have Edasm to look at, modify, or assemble these 
files. More on this in a future column. 

For now, let go of your inhibitions and prepare yourself to receive the 
secrets of Apple hi-res graphics: the weird binary tables, blazingly fast 
unwound loops, and bizarre self-modifying codes that let us blast those 
dots. 

Next month: de-Wozzing your Apple.

We'll begin this column with the first of a series on one of the most 
popular printers in use today for the Apple, the Epson dot-matrix printer. 

The Epson can be found just about anywhere an Apple is because, 
when it first came out on the market, the Epson was one of the few 
printers to have the unbeatable combination of affordability, reliability, 
an easily replaceable ribbon, and special print functions. The problem 
with it is the documentation and (until the introduction of the FX) the 
constantly changing printer operating system. 

The original documentation for the MX printer has been referred to 
by some as the "Radio Shack Joke Book" due to its orientation to the 
TRS-80 personal computer, the attempts at humor by the author, and the 
running-commentary style of writing. Users have complained that the 
sample programs in the book do not work with the Apple and that it is 



Result B: 9 (italicized "9" = Graftrax Plus) 

Result C: 9 (normal "9" = original MX-80 or onrjinal MX 100) 

That was simple, wasn't it? Now that you know exactly what type of 
Epson you have, let's see what they can do: 

MX-70: Normal and expanded text modes; dot-addressable graphics 
(can do a hi-res screen dump); programmable line spacing and form 
feeding; "delete"-type backspacing. 

MX-80 (original): Twelve print modes using normal, emphasis, ex- 
panded, and condensed; programmable form feeding, horizontal tab- 
bing, line spacing, and vertical tabbing. Cannot do a hi-res screen dump 
but can print block graphics if a printer interface card is used that can 
transmit the most significant (high) bit. 




Printing Out Has Its Epson Downs... 



difficult to wade through the jokes and commentary to find just the infor- 
mation needed. 

The Epson also went through quite a bit of development. It began as 
an all-but-extinct printer called the TX, ran the gauntlet with the MX 
series, and then finally blossomed forth into the FX and now the RX 
printers. The MX series is where most people have problems. 

Difficulties arise with the MX printer because there are six different 
models, each having its own operating system and each capable of doing 
radically different functions. Here are the models: 



Model Printer Operating System 

MX-70 Original MX-70 

MX-80 Original MX-80 

MX-80 Graftrax 80 

MX-80 Graftrax Plus; also known as "Type III" 

MX-100 Original MX-1 00 

MX-100 Graftrax Plus; also known as "Type III" 



It is important that you be able to identify the exact type of MX 
printer that you own. This is the only way you can figure out how to get 
the special functions of the Epson to work. Identifying the MX-70, 
MX-80, and MX-100 is straightforward enough: That information can 
usually be found on a model plate on the front of the machine or on a foil 
label on the back. Also, the MX-70 has a two-tone chocolate color, the 
MX-80 is fourteen inches wide, and the MX-100 is nearly two feet wide. 

The problem comes in trying to identify what kind of operating 
system you have in your printer. The first one, the MX-70, is easy: It has 
only one operating system, the original MX-70. Turning on your printer 
and running the following simple program will distinguish the others: 

10 LET ESC$ = CHR$(27) 

20 HIBITS = ESC$ + ">" : LOBIT$= ESC$ + " = " 
30 PR#1 

40 PRINT HIBITS : PRINT CHR$(185) : PRINT LOBITS 
50 PR#0 

Result A: '■(block graphics character = Graftrax 80) 



MX-80 (Graftrax 80): Twenty-four print modes using normal, em- 
phasis, expanded, condensed, and italics; programmable form feeding, 
horizontal tabbing, line spacing, and vertical tabbing; most-significant- 
bit-control; home printhead; "delete"-type backspacing; redefinable 
escape codes. Can do a hi-res screen dump. 

MX-80 (Graftrax Plus): Twenty-four modes using normal, emphasis 
(which can be "locked on"), expanded, condensed, and italics; pro- 
grammable form feeding (improved), horizontal tabbing, line spacing, 
and right margin; most-significant-bit control; foreign alphabet symbols; 
home printhead; true backspacing; redefinable escape codes; skip-over- 
perforation control; subscription and superscription; underlining; 
unidirectional printing. Can do a hi-res screen dump and also has "line" 
graphics. 

MX-100 (original): Twelve print modes using normal, emphasis, ex- 
panded, and condensed; progranmiable form feeding, horizontal tabbing, 
line spacing, right margin, and vertical tabbing; most-significant-bit con- 
trol; "delete"-type backspacing; foreign character sets; skip-over- 
perforation control. Can do a hi-res screen dump. 

MX-100 (Graftrax Plus): Twenty-four print modes using normal, em- 
phasis (which can be "locked on"), expanded, condensed, and italics; 
programmable form feeding (improved), horizontal tabbing, line spac- 
ing, and right margin; most-significant-bit control; foreign alphabet 
symbols; home printhead; true backspacing; redefinable escape codes; 
skip-over-perforation control; subscription and superscription; underlin- 
ing; undirectional printing. Can do a hi-res screen dump and also has 
"line" graphics. 

FX-80: Fantastic printer; 160 cps or 80 cps in a special, "Blue 
Thunder"-type "quiet mode"; downloadable, define-your-own 
character set; proportional spacing; reverse line feeding, and so on. Will 
be covered in a separate column. 

RX-80: Economy, no-frills model. Will be covered in a separate 
column. 

As you can see, there is a wide variety of special functions your 
printer can perform. Some models can do things that others can't and 
there is some overlapping of features between models. Don't worry if 
you don't understand what some of the features mean. This column will

OCTOBER 1983; 



try to explain those things. To make life simpler, Epson has discontinued 
manufacturing all but the Graftrax Plus models, the FX-80, and the 
RX-80. 

Let's take a look at some of the more common questions and prob- 
lems with the Epson. They fall within the following categories: 

1. Printer hardware. This would include paper-out condition, trac- 
tor feeding, sheet feeding, care and feeding of the ribbon, maintenance 
tips, and switch settings. 

2. Printing from program control. This would cover using printer 
functions from Applesoft, Pascal, assembly language, CP/M, and so on. 

3. Printing from word processor control. This would include 
prepackaged programs that reduce your ability to control the printer 
directly. 

4. Printer interface cards. This would cover the mysterious "MSB" 
(most significant bit, bit 7, or high bit) and the ins and outs of sending 
characters to the printer. 

5. Graphics. This would cover hi-res, lo-res, and text screen 
dumps, as well as more exotic things such as strip chart recording, art- 
work, and garden- variety doodling. 

Let's start at the beginning with printer hardware questions. First, 
let's take the problem of the paper out condition. The Epson is con- 
figured to stop printing and to buzz when it runs out of paper. This can be 
annoying when you're trying to feed single sheets of paper through the 
printer. The problem can be solved by flipping a switch within the 
printer or by sending a turn-off code to the printer, but it is a heck of a lot 
easier just to stick a business card or a scrap of paper down the paper 
feed slot until you feel (and perhaps hear) the paper trip switch click. Just 
tape the card in place and now the Epson will be tricked into believing 
that there is always paper in it. You can put sheet-fed or form-feed paper 
in the printer as before, just by sliding the leading edge of the paper 
under the card. 

The ribbon is an interesting topic. The original cartridges put out by 
Epson had a sticker on the top that said "Exchange Times" to allow a 
ribbon reloader to circle the number of times a new ribbon was placed in 
the cartridge. That scheme was abandoned by Epson, although it seems 



to make pretty good sense now. Judging from a conversation held recent- 
ly between the author and a ribbon re-inker (talk about cottage industries 
springing up around the Apple!), apparently the best way to handle a rib- 
bon is to buy a first-rate, high-quality, brand-new ribbon cartridge and, 
when it wears out, to have it reloaded by someone with the proper skills 
and equipment— unless you like breaking obscure pieces of plastic and 
having a greasy ribbon squirt all over your clothes. This is a controver- 
sial topic, so any responses from readers with experiences to the contrary 
will be welcomed. The cheaper ribbons apparently do not last as long as 
an "official" reload, and they save money by scrimping on springs and 
other internal parts that maintain tension on the ribbon. If there's no ten- 
sion, the ribbon falls down into the gears, kinks, or smudges the paper. 

By the way, our re-inker points out that, when the ribbon's a little 
worn, you can squeeze some more life out of it by twisting it. The best 
way to do this is to remove the cartridge, twist the ribbon, and turn the 
ribbon advance knob until the twist "takes." Put the cartridge back in 
the printer and the printer will print on the unused lower half of the rib- 
bon. After a complete trip through the cartridge, the ribbon will accept 
the change and remain inverted, but without the twist. As a final sugges- 
tion, there's nothing quite as handy as a pencil tip for pushing the ribbon 
down in front of the printhead. 

Maintenance is simple. Look inside your printer just underneath the 
ribbon. You'll probably see public enemy number one: paper and ribbon 
debris. Don't fret; it's easy to remove. Once every three months (or 
whenever the accumulations become exceptionally gross), you should 
remove the ribbon and printer case and gently brush all that stuff out with 
a soft brush. 

Printer switch settings raise a lot of questions, and well they should. 
They control whether you will single- or double-space, be able to get 
special characters, turn off that doggone buzzer, and so on. The pesky 
little things are deep within the Epson; you'll have to remove the 
printer's case to get to them. They consist of two little black boxes, each 
with a row of tiny white switches on top. They are soldered in place in 
case you have any ideas about moving them to the outside of the printer. 
And they are small. You will need something approaching a jeweler's

New 15 day free trial offer on 

The Pizza Program 

Novi/ you can try it for 15 days before you pay — at no risk! 



A GREAT TIME SAVER 

The Pizza Program is a great 
time saver for anyone who cooks 
or shops at the grocery store To 
prove it we'll send you The Pizza 
Program to test for 15 days And 
we won't send you a bill until 
after you've had at least 15 days 
to use it. This will give you plenty 
of time to get it, look it over, try 
it out. 

ENDS HO-HUM DINNERS 

Are you tired of the same old 
thing for dinner'' Would you like 
more variety in your evening 
meal? Is there something you'd 
rather have but don't get very 
often'' The Pizza Program is de- 
signed just for you. It's a delight- 
ful new software package cre- 
ated to end the dinner-blahs with 
computer generated menus. 
Here is how it works. 

You review what you like from 
the pre-selected food groups In 
the data base. You can easily 
delete any foods you don't enjoy 
or add anything new at any time. 
Then decide how often you like 
to eat certain items. For example 
Don't like liver? Then eliminate it 
with a few simple keystrokes. Or, 
you can plan for it as often as 
every day or as seldom as once 
every 99 weeks 

Want to go out more often to 
your favorite restaurants? Enter 
the restaurant's name as a "Main 
Course." Now your computer will 
automatically remind you to go 
out to eat— and where— as often 
as you select. It can delete all 
other Items from that meal ex- 
cept the name of the restaurant. 

AUTOMATIC SHOPPING LIST 

You get a new menu for a day, 
a week or any period of time you 
select up to 42 days at a time. It 
generates a detailed shopping 
list, automatically. And you can 
print out either menus or shop- 
ping lists anytime you want. It 
can even arrange each Item on 
the shopping list in sequence 
according to the aisles at your 
favorite store. Studies show a 
shopping list will discourage 
Impulse buying and save you 
money. 

Also, it generates a per serving 
calorie counter. This is easy to 
delete anytime you are not in a 
diet mood or want to celebrate 
for any reason 

RANDOMLY DELICIOUS 

Say goodbye to boring meals 
Your computer will remember 
variety is the spice of life. This 
system makes eating at home a 
pleasure again. Each menu Is 
randomly generated from 5 
major food groups according to 
the specific criteria you select. 
The Pizza Program is easy to 



learn and operate. Yet it is a 
sophisticated piece of software 
which will prevent menu mixups. 

The Pizza Program is a com- 
plete menu planning system you 
customize to fit your tastes and 
budget It's not a recipe file but 
rather a practical way to organize 
your meal planning. You'll appre- 
ciate it day after day, week after 
week. People across the country 
are finding it a super idea— a 
great companion to any kitchen. 

SEND NO MONEY NOW 

You can try it with no obliga- 
tion. Our home trial lets you 
actually use The Pizza Program 
for a full 15 days before you de- 
cide to keep It Watch the fun and 
convenience It creates. Enjoy 
better meals and see how much 
time it saves. If you are not satis- 
fied for any reason, return it 
within 15 days and owe nothing. 
If you approve, you'll be billed 
later for just $34.50 plus $2 for 
shipping and handling. (Cali- 
fornia residents add 6V?% sales 
tax). A full 40 pages of instruc- 
tions are included. 

OUT OF THE RUT 

One woman's reaction to this 
program is typical. She wrote, 
"Before u-sing your system I 
found myself getting into a rut 
of serving the same things over 
and over. The Pizza Program has 
changed all of this for me. We 
now have a wider variety of din- 
ners and best of all I don't have 
to decide what they will be. If 
this was all it did, I'd be thrilled. 
But It isn't. The shopping list I 
receive along with my menus 
has been such a time-saver I 
quickly run through it and delete 
anything I feel I don't need and 
add something I might. I would 
have a hard time going back to 
doing my menus by hand." 

This system Is available for 
both the IBM PC, XT and the 
Apple II Plus or lie". (Also runs 
on compatible systems). We urge 
you to take advantage of our 
no-risk, 15 day free trial offer. To 
order send us your name, address 
with zip code, and the name of 
your computer. We'll rush you 
The Pizza Program to try at no 
obligation. So write today

screwdriver to flip their switches. (In a pinch, an unfolded paper clip will 
do.) Looking at the boxes from above the printer, you'll see that there is 
a smaller box on the left (SW-2) and a longer one on the right (SW-1). 
Each white switch on the box is numbered from the bottom (bottom 
referring to the printhead side of the printer), beginning with 1. The 
switches are referred to as 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4 and 1-1, 1-2 ... 1-8. Figures f 
1 and 2 give the proper settings for two of the more common printer 
operating systems, Graftrax 80 and Graftrax Plus (some settings reflect 
personal preferences; you may certainly change any that you don't like). 

That covers the printer hardware controls. Next month we'll see how 
to control the printer from within a program.

Auto LF: Automatically supplies a line feed after a carriage return to cause the 
printer to space to the next line after printing a line of characters. This is normally 
the job of the printer interface card, so the printer should not be set to do auto LF. 

Buffer. The Epson has a built-in storage area for characters sent to it for print- 
ing. The printer waits until it receives a carriage return or too many characters 
(usually 80) before printing the contents of the buffer. 

CR (carriage return) : Causes the printer to print all of the characters stored in 
its buffer. 

LF (line feed): Causes the printer to advance the paper one line. 

Software selectable: A command that causes the printer either to ignore 
(without hanging the system) or to accept characters sent to it for printing. 

Slashed zero: A zero with a slash through it to ensure that it is not confused 
with a capital "O." 

SOP (skip-over-perforation): Automatic margin at the bottom and top of fan- 
folded paper. Useful with straight dumps, program listings, and so on.

KEYS T 



Rats. You're at work, and you realize that you forgot to set the timers 
to turn on the lawn sprinklers at home. No problem. Just dial up your 
home computer and have it set the timers for you. 

Rats again. The stock market quotes will be coming in at seven 
o'clock tomorrow morning, but you won't be there to download them on 
the office computer because you'd planned on staying up late tonight and 
watching David Letterman. Knowing that you'll be deader than drift- 
wood in the morning, you simply dial up your office computer and pro- 
gram it to retrieve the market quotes for you. 

These are two entirely different scenarios that are both possible 
with today's microcomputer telecommunications. But what about 
the future? 

Drat. Your son left for the lunar colony today and you couldn't make 
it to the launch pad in time to remind him to take his vitamins while he's 
away. Oh well, better call up his computer at the colony and leave a 
message. Let's see, that's two satellite hook-ups, since the moon is on 
the opposite side of the earth in the morning. Hmm . . . that'll cost a lit- 
tle extra. 

Double drat. Mom took the laser floppies you wanted to make backup 
copies of. Maybe you can catch her on her way to work. It's a good thing 
she's wearing her crystal Apple (voice-recognition wrist version 2.2). 
What a pain if you had to wait until she got to the office. "Hi, mom. 
How's the traffic? Good. Say, you know those disks you put in your 
locket this morning. ..." 

That may seem far-fetched today, and it might seem just as im- 
probable decades from now; but the point is that it's possible. But the 
distant future isn't what this column on telecommunications is about. 
We're more interested in the present. Yet, a funny thing about the future 
is that it eventually tends to become the present. We'll be keeping an eye 
on the future, trying to see how much closer telecommunications gets to 
being there each day. 

Computers and modems. That's what this column is all about. It 
doesn't matter if you're interested in telecommunications as a hobby or 
for business use; we'll be covering both of these areas in the months 
to come. 

This isn't going to be a technical column. We won't be learning how 
to build modems or how to write telecommunications programs. In 
short, we won't be doing anything that requires a technical mind or a 
scientific background. It's not because we're biased against techies, but 
because there are good places for technical jargon and programming ex- 
ercises, and this isn't one of them. 

This is the place for people who want to find out what's going on in 
the ever-changing world of computer communications. The questions 
we'll be looking at include: What's new? Is it available yet? Can I use it? 
Is it any good? How much does it cost? 

If it sounds like we're trying to cram a miniature magazine into these 
few pages every month, it's because telecommunications is a field that's 
as varied and complex as computers themselves. Currently, there's hard- 



ware, software, and just about every device and service one can imagine 
available for people interested in making their computers talk with other 
computers. That's right, talk. 

Before we go any further, there are two terms we ought to define in 
order to get everyone thinking on the same level. 

Telecommunications actually refers to any communication using 
telephones, radio, television, or telegraph. In other words, it means 
communicating electronically. For the purposes of our discussion, we'll 
thumb our noses at the dictionary and take the term to mean simply com- 
munication between computers. 

A modem is something needed in order for the computer to send and 
receive information. There's no way around them; you have to have one. 
And we'll discuss them in more detail later. 

Lesson One: Seif-Defense. When you tell fellow computer friends 
that you bought a modem for your Apple, they usually ask you the same 
question your noncomputer friends asked when you told them you 
bought a computer: "Oh yeah? Whatcha gonna do with it?" The usual 
answer is, "Are you kidding? All sorts of things!" Then you try to think 
of some. 

The truth is, a lot of hobbyists buy modems because it just seems like 
the thing to do. There are those who add modems to their computer 
systems and can't imagine how they got along without them; and there 
are those who play with their modems for a few weeks and then rare- 
ly use them again. In both cases, the modems were purchased out 
of curiosity. 

It's not the same for businesses; they usually have valid reasons for 
getting into computer communications, and such an investment can save 
money in the long run. Sending business memos and sales reports, con- 
necting to distant computers to receive stock market information, and 
teleconferencing are some of the "serious" applications of modems, 
applications that more than justify the cost of adding a modem to the of- 
fice computer. 

Hobbyists, however, get into telecommunications for the same 
reason they got into computers— to find out what it's all about. 

These are simplified reasons why we add modems to our Apples. For 
transcendentalists and Zen fanatics, we can ask: "Are there deeper, 
more meaningful reasons?" Well, yes. 

If you can think of the computer as a medium, then it's not hard to 
imagine people communicating with each other through their computers. 
To illustrate, consider the following situation. 

The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. Imagine a man in a room by himself, 
completely shut off from the world. He has all the necessities of life 
(shelter, food, water, a controlled environment), so he has no need for 
anyone else. Now suppose he breaks a hole in the wall of his room. 
When he looks outside, he sees many more rooms just like his, each with 
someone living inside. Soon, the people in those rooms break little holes 
in their walls, allowing them to see outside as well. 

Assuming they can't (or don't want to) climb through the hole to the

outside, they begin exchanging messages with each other by shouting. 
They are communicating. 

Before the man in the room discovered other people in other rooms, 
he was already communicating— with himself. Four things that com- 
munication requires are a sender, a message, a medium, and a receiver. 
Thinking, wondering, and pondering are all forms of communication; 
the sender and receiver are the same person and the medium is the brain. 
When the people in the rooms broke holes in their walls, they discovered 
other potential receivers of their communications. 

And that's how it is with computers. 

When you use the Apple to figure out finances, write letters or man- 
uscripts, play games, or do anything else computers are used for, you're 
communicating with yourself. You input (send) a message, the computer 
(the medium) analyzes it, and it then outputs something you receive. 

Theorists might argue that you're communicating with the computer, 
that true communication requires the message to be understood by the re- 
ceiver, or that you're really communicating with the person who wrote 
the software you're using. That all makes for fine philosophical discus- 
sion. But we'll just accept the computer as an extension of the mind. 
When we use it, we're using our minds, and we're communicating with 
ourselves. 

Seen this way, the computer is like a disconnected telephone; you can 
talk, shout, whisper, scream, or sing into it all you like, but the only 
voice you hear is your own. Of course, the telephone wasn't created with 
just one person in mind; it was created so people could talk to each other. 
The computer wasn't created with only one person in mind either, but its 
use by just one person at a time is very common; it doesn't need another 
computer to function properly. 

However, there are other computers out there— millions of them. 
And, if they could communicate with each other, what would they say? 
They probably wouldn't say much, since they still depend on humans to 
make them communicate. Sure, there might be a few that connect to 
other computers at specified times during the day, but all that was pro- 
grammed by a human. 

Before we go any further, let's take a look at how computers 



communicate with each other. 

Bits of Logic. Though sometimes referred to as a complex 
mathematical calculator, the Apple is actually a logical machine. This 
doesn't mean that everything it does makes sense to us. The Apple deals 
with information in a logical manner— either something is "true" or it's 
"false." The computer represents true and false values by thousands of 
electronic switches that are always either on or off. In order to make 
things easier to understand, we picture these switches as being either a 1 
or aO, representing "on" and "off respectively. 

We refer to all these ones and zeros as bits, which comes from the 
term Mnary dig/r5. If we were to construct a physical model of what the 
electronic insides of the Apple look like, we might represent all proc- 
essed information as hundreds of thousands of ones and zeros. 

Bits are the smallest pieces of information the computer understands, 
just as letters of an alphabet are the smallest piece of information humans 
understand when dealing with written material . If you can picture some- 
one speaking or writing to you one letter at a time, you have a general 
idea how computers communicate over the phone lines— one bit at 
a time. 

It's as if we talked to one another by uttering each letter of each word 
we wanted to say. Greeting your neighbor, "Hello, Mr. Flintstone," 
would be pronounced, "Aitch ee el el oh comma em i es tee ee ar eff el 
i en tee ess tee oh en ee. " Clearly, it's a much slower process than if we 
communicated a whole word at a time. 

The Apple usually handles information much faster than this. Its mi- 
croprocessor, the 6502, is an eight-bit processor, which means it handles 
bits in groups of eight. One or two bits doesn't make much sense to the 
computer, so it grabs them eight at a time, just as we read words in their 
entirety. It's only when the Apple has to communicate with another com- 
puter via a modem that it deals with information one bit at a time. Com- 
municating over the phone lines, or even through cables to another ter- 
minal in the same room, is an example of this. 

And the computer handles bits as electrical switches. When a switch 
is on, it carries a certain voltage; when it's off, it carries a different 
voltage. In order for computers to communicate with each other, they

have to be connected by a physical device such as a cable. We now have 
two options; either we set up a network of lines to and from every com- 
puter we want to communicate with, or we use some that already exist, 
like telephone wires. 

It's easier to do it by telephone, but it's not always efficient. For in- 
stance, banks, which are constantly sending and receiving data among 
branches, need a line that they can have access to immediately. If they 
had to dial the telephone each time they wanted to conduct a transaction, 
the cost of placing all those calls would far exceed the cost of setting up 
their own lines. 

A Modem Is What a Modem Does. In order for computers to com- 
municate, they need some way of transforming their electrical informa- 
tion (bits) into audio signals that can be sent through the phone lines. 
That's where a modem comes in. Modem gets its name from the combi- 
nation of the words modulator and i/emodulator. 

When data is going from the computer to the phone lines, it needs to 
be changed into some kind of sound. The modem modulates electrical 
data into audio data, or sound. It's sort of like changing written words in- 
to Morse code; the person transmitting the code modulates the letters he 
sees into a series of dots and dashes that are sent to the receiver. The 
human plays the same part in this example as the modem in computer 
communications. 

The sound patterns that represent all those bits of information are 
then sent zipping through the phone lines to their destination, whether 
it's next door or across the globe. When it finally gets there, it has to 
undergo the reverse process. The modem at the receiving end demodu- 
lates the signal from sound patterns back to electrical data the receiving 
computer can understand. Again, this process is similar to the person 
receiving Morse code; he changes the dots and dashes he hears into let- 
ters that become words on a page. 

To sum up all this talk of modulation/demodulation, the modem is 
really just a translator. The actual information, electrical or audio, stays 
the same; it's just expressed in a different way. 

So that's what a modem is, a device that encodes and decodes infor- 



mation. Computer illiterates needn't feel ashamed to think of it as a 
thingamajig that does whatchamacallit to the computer junk. 

The Real Reasons We Have Modems. Folklore has it that the first 
modem was invented by a computer nut named Dennis, who was just try- 
ing to see if this whole telecommunications thing was possible. He built 
a modem for his computer, but couldn't tell if it worked or not because 
he had only one. Two days later, he built a second modem and gave it to 
his friend, Marvin. Dennis still couldn't tell if modems worked because 
Marvin didn't have a computer; so Dennis got Marvin a computer. 

As soon as Marvin learned how to use the computer, he and Dennis 
put their modems to work. Dennis phoned Marvin, and they "talked" to 
each other by typing at the keyboard. The problem was that, program- 
mers that they were, neither Dennis nor Marvin could type very well or 
very quickly. It would have been much more efficient if they just picked 
up the phones and talked to each other in the normal fashion. 

After a while, our heroes wanted to be able to exchange with each 
other the programs they had written. To make this possible, Dennis 
wrote something called a terminal program. Marvin went out and bought 
flowers because he thought it meant Dennis was ill and that this would be 
his last program ever. Dennis sent the flowers back and explained that a 
terminal program is a piece of software that instructs the computer to 
send or receive data, store information that's received, and perform all 
sorts of nifty functions. 

The specific function Dennis had in mind was the transfer of actual 
programs, rather than text data, which is about all they could transfer up 
to that point. He gave a copy of the program to Marvin and they were all 
set. Unfortunately, as with most software, the documentation was poorly 
written, and Marvin couldn't make heads nor tails out of it. Not even Den- 
nis could understand it, even though he wrote it; he thought software 
documentation was supposed to be confusing. 

In the end, they spent much more time trying to transfer their pro- 
grams via modem than it would have taken for one person to drive to the 
other's house and simply hand him the disk. But they persisted nonethe- 
less, getting more frustrated each time and racking up phone bills 
like crazy. 

Why We Bother. Let's take a look at what we've learned from Den- 
nis and Marvin. First, communication such as a straight conversation is 
more efficient if we just pick up the phone and use our voices. Second, 
it's usually more economical to deliver personally or mail a disk with a 
file on it than to try to send it by modem, especially if the receiver is a 
long-distance call away. The postage needed to mail a single disk is 
about thirty-seven cents. 

Given those two points, why do we insist on using modems? Why do 
we choose to take the cumbersome, more expensive, and more time- 
consuming way to do things? Because it's fun. 

There's really no way to explain fiilly what is meant by fun; it just 
feels like it's fun. You get the feeling that you're not alone sitting there at 
your terminal. There's somebody else out there, somewhere. 

And because the computer is such a different medium of communica- 
tion, the content of the communication is also different. If you've ever 
watched someone chat with someone else by modem, you'll notice that 
the participants say things that they normally wouldn't say if they were 
talking face to face or on the phone. Not only that, but they say things 
differently. Part of this has to do with the fact that no one has to look 
anyone in the eye. Pleasantries can be expressed more pleasandy; anger 
can be expressed more honestly. 

Much the same can be said about transferring programs and other 
files by modem from one disk to another. Unless you're so familiar with 
a terminal program that you can almost use it blindfolded, transferring 
files by modem is a bit awkward and not as easy as doing so by other 
means. The problem here is not with modems, but with the terminal pro- 
gram software. 

The field of computer telecommunications today is much like the 
field of computers was a few years ago — young and growing. As more 
people begin sinking their teeth (and money) into modems, the problems 
and inconveniences we experience today will be corrected. More serv- 
ices will become available, modems and software will become easier to 
use, and we'll all be enjoying the activity more. 

This column is where we'll find out about many of the changes that 
will be taking place in telecommunications and learn more about how to 
make the most of Dennis's invention. 

It should be informative, and it should be fiin. Di

The only communications software 

you'll ever need! 

Softerm 1 

The Complete, Upgradeable Package 
for Home or Business Use 

Softerm 1 is a powerful and flexible terminal emula- 
tion program that operates on an Apple® II, II Plus, 
or lie to provide basic terminal communications to 
a variety of fiost computers, timesharing services, 
and information services such as The Sourcef" 
CompuServe® and the Dow Jones News/ Retrieval"' 
It operates full or half-duplex at speeds up to 
9600 bps using either a direct connection or any 
standard manual or auto-dial modem. Features in- 
clude user-defined keyboard macros, built-in phone 
book for automatic dialing, terminal mode line 
capture simultaneously to print or disk, copy screen 
to print or disk, and terminal status display. 

DOS, CP/M, and PASCAL 
File Compatibility Combined In 
a Single Program 

Softerm 1 incorporates an advanced file manager 
which provides compatibility with DOS 3.3, CP/M, 
and Pascal disk formats for all file operations 
including file transfers. And at speeds up to 5 times 
faster than standard Apple DOS! Built-in disk utili- 
ties provide INIT. CATALOG, RENAME, and DELETE 
commands for all disk formats. Wildcard match char- 
acters can be used whenever filenames are entered. 

Local file transfers allow DOS, CP/M, or Pascal 
files to be displayed, printed, or even copied to 
another disk. For example, a file on a CP/M for- 
matted disk in Drive 1 could be copied to a Pascal 
formatted disk in Drive 2 providing a complete 
format conversion capability. Numerous editing 
options such as tab expansion and removing 
unwanted characters allow easy reformatting of 
data to accommodate the variations in data formats 
used by host computers. 



Multi-Protocol 

File Transfer Capability 

Softerm 1 offers file transfer methods flexible 
enough to match any host computer requirement. 
These include the character protocol with user- 
definable characteristics to provide maximum flexi- 
bility for text file transfers to any computer. The 
CP/M User's Group standard XMODEM protocol 
may be used for binary file transfers with systems 
using the CP/M operating system. The intelligent 
Softrans protocol can be used to transfer any type 
file and provides automatic binary encoding and 
decoding, error detection and automatic retransmis- 
sion, and data compression to enhance line utiliza- 
tion. A FORTRAN 77 source program is supplied 
with Softerm 1 which is easily adaptable to any 
host computer to allow communications with 
Softerm using the Softrans protocol. Specific host 
computer versions of the Softrans FORTRAN pro- 
gram are available on request. 
Softerm file transfer utilizes an easy to use com- 
mand language which may be executed interactively 
or from a macro command file which has been 
previously entered and saved on disk. Twenty-three 
high-level commands include DIAL, CATALOG, 
SEND RECEIVE ONERR MONITOR HANGUP, and 
others. A SCHEDULE command even allows file 
transfers at a specific date and time. 

Softerm 2 

The "Choice of Professionals" 

Softerm 2 includes all features of Softerm 1 and 
provides an exact terminal emulation for a wide 
range of conversational and block mode CRT ter- 
minals. Special function keys, sophisticated editing 
features, even local printer capabilities of the ter- 
minals emulated are fully supported. In fact, your 
host computer won't know the difference! All of the 
following emulations are included in Softerm 2 and 
the list is growing...

OBSERVING 
ASTRONOMICAL 
APPLES 




At Griffith 
Observatory 




BV HOWARD A. SHORE 



Perched on the side of Mount Hollywood overlooking the sprawling, 
often smog-enshrouded metropolis of Los Angeles, the Griffith Observa- 
tory stands like a monument to the aspirations of an earlier generation. 
Its twelve-inch Zeiss telescope peers watchfully into the night sky, giv- 
ing visitors from all over the world an opportunity to view for themselves 
the glittering constellations. 

On the north court, an imposing white pyramidal structure heralds the 
approach to the observatory. This sculptured monument pays tribute to 
Galileo, Newton, Kepler, Herschel, Hipparchus, and Copernicus, six of 
mankind's greatest astronomers. 

Stairway to the Heavens. Atop a wide granite stairway, massive 
bronze doors open to reveal a marble-floored rotunda— site of the first of 
the observatory's many wonders. There, suspended by a single golden 
strand attached to a frictionless bearing mounted high in the vaulted ceil- 
ing above, a forty-foot, two-hundred-and-forty-pound pendulum swings 
without resistance across a shallow well. Because of the inertia of the 
heavy metal ball, the Foucault pendulum, as the towering display is 
called, always maintains a steady course. Yet, if watched closely, the 
pendulum seems gradually to change its course. This seeming inconsis- 
tency is made apparent by an arc of small wooden blocks on the floor of 
the well that, over the course of the day, are knocked over one by one. 
This is due not to the gradual change in the direction of the pendulum, 
but rather to the rotation of the earth beneath it. 

On all sides of the rotunda, exhibits and displays help to demonstrate 
fundamental laws of physics and astronomy by providing illuminating 
looks at the earth and the universe. The hallways are filled with 
exhibits — everything from a sample of meteoric rock dating back thou-

planetarium projector silhouetted against a background of stars. "This

sands of years to a modern "multiplexed" hologram of the earth as seen 
from an orbital weather satellite. 

The observatory's six-hundred-seat planetarium— a cosmic theater 
where heavenly spectacles are re-created and explored— delights and 
enlightens audiences, in keeping with a tradition steadfastly held since 
the observatory first opened its doors in 1935. 

An institute devoted to public education rather than research, Griffith 
Observatory has, nonetheless, made contributions to the world of as- 
tronomy. Among the most notable of these is astronomer Paul Roques's 
discovery in October 1961 of a "flare star." A flare star is characterized 
by short periods of significant increases in brightness, which may last 
several seconds or several minutes. 

Down the west wing of the observatory's museum, past the flashing 
display of a tesla coil, is a new exhibit— one which, since its opening in 
January, has typically been surrounded by visitors of all ages. Situated in 
the center of a stylishly designed display cabinet with the words "As- 
tronomical Computer" embossed on its front is an Apple II Plus. A clear 
Lucite covering, with an opening to provide access to the keyboard, 
gives visitors a look at the inner workings of the Astronomical Apple. 

The Demonstrative Apple. Donated by the philanthropic community 
support group Friends of the Observatory (FOTO), the observatory's 
display Apple was programmed by Peter Scott, a graduate in computer 
programming at Cambridge University in England. 

A former resident of Essex, England, Scott currently works at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. There he is engaged in 
the programming of navigational maneuvers for the Galileo project, the 
unmanned Jupiter probe scheduled to launch later this decade. 

Scott's interest in astronomy, a love that goes back to childhood, is 




Making education enjoyable is one of the highest priorities of the Griffith 
Observatory staff. Above: Director John Mosley on the steps leading to the

strongly connected to his work with computers. Although he trained on 
Cambridge University's IBM 3081, he holds microcomputers in high 
regard. 

"Their main advantage lies in the fact that they are oriented toward 
single users," he says. "This enables them to eliminate the vast amount 
of software and hardware that, on mainframes, is there purely to handle 
the interaction between multiple users." 

Based on data and algorithms provided by John E. Mosley — the per- 
son most responsible for the continued development of the observatory's 
remarkable exhibits — Scott has written three menu-driven Applesoft pro- 
grams. All were designed with the tradition of the observatory in 
mind— to teach and enlighten, while remaining entertaining and en- 
joyable. 

Museum patrons have three programs to choose from: Professor 
Astro, Hangman, and Birthdates. 

Professor Astro is a quiz program that challenges users to answer up 
to twenty-five multiple-choice and true/false questions. The questions 
range from the derivative names of constellations to the distance of the 
nearest star (not Alpha Centauri, but Sol, our sun) from the earth. Play- 
ers get several opportunities to answer each question and are awarded 
points according to the number of tries it takes them to supply the correct 
answer— three points for a correct answer on the first attempt, two points 
for a right answer the second attempt, and so on. Bonus points are given 
for getting more than one correct answer in a row. 

Each correctly answered question is followed by a randomly 
generated phrase of encouragement such as, "You know almost as much 
about this as I do," or "You're the best we've had in some time," or 
"Dynamite." There's also a brief graphic and audio reward for correct

answers. After each question has been answered, an explanation de- 
signed to provide players with a broader understanding of the subject 
is given. 

Planet Waves, The questions are meant to be challenging but not im- 
possible, and the explanations are always informative. Many questions 
have to be read careftilly. Take this example: "The planet that is farthest 
from the sun at this moment is?" Four possible answers are given — 
Mercury, Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto. 

The correct answer, Neptune, is accompanied by this explanation: 
"Although Pluto is, on the average, farther from the sun than is Nep- 
tune, Pluto's orbit is not circular and crosses Neptune's orbit. From 
1979 until 1999 Neptune is actually farther from the sun than is Pluto." 

The second program in the exhibit. Hangman, plays the same way the 
original word guessing game does. The Apple builds a scaffolding, a 
noose, and finally a hanging stick figure on the screen, while the player 
makes a desperate effort to figure out which letters fill in the blanks. As 
in Astro Quiz, all the terms, names, and words used in this Hangman are 
astronomical in nature. 

The final game in the exhibit, Birthdates, is not really a game at all, 
but rather an elaborate algorithmic program. Users enter their birthdates 
and, in return, are treated to a diagram showing the phase of the moon at 
their birth, the number of days a fiill moon preceded that date, and the 
total number of days that have elapsed in their lives. The program also 
translates these dates into their equivalents in the Chinese and Hebrew 
calendars. 

Perhaps the most interesting feature of this program is its planetary 
calculations. According to the program, "Each planet takes a different 
amount of time to go around the sun, so each planet's year is a different 



length." The program gives the length of a "year" (in earth years) on 
each of the nine planets in the solar system, along with the user's age and 
birthdate as they would be on each of the planets. 

Born in the Red Spot. For example, an individual bom on April 24, 
1949, on Earth would be 34.26 years old. If that same person had been 
bom on the planet Jupiter— assuming he could survive the titanic gravity 
and violently hostile and poisonous atmosphere— he would be a mere 
2.89 years old. Jupiter's immense distance from the sun requires it to 
travel 11.86 Earth years just to complete a single orbit around Sol. The 
individual's next birthday would be on November 23, 1984. 

All three programs in the exhibit are as foolproof as Scott could make 
them. He relied on conventional and unconventional methods of 
"crashproofing. " 

"I was writing these programs while I was just leaming about the Ap- 
ple. In fact, when they first put me to work I had never seen an Apple 
before and had only worked on similar Basic systems. I got gradually 
more expert, but I hadn't come across the machine language routine that 
kills the control-C break-in." Scott was thus forced to employ a 
rather "sledgehammerlike" approach, manually disengaging the 
control key. 

"That was the last part of the protection mechanism," Scott recalls. 
"It is super-redundant really; I don't like to leave anything to chance. 
When I had to get into the program, I used the trick with the Integer card, 
enabling it so that when you reset, the computer goes in there rather than 
going to the auto- vector. From the Monitor, I could clear the flag at $D6, 
which prevents you from listing or saving the program." 

In fact, storing an $FF at the Monitor memory location $D6— often 
called the "mn only flag" or the "Applesoft mystery parameter" —

causes an Applesoft program to run, even if a user enters gibberish at the 
keyboard. 

The Celestial Apple. Observatory director John Mosley, who owns 
his own Apple, explains how the Astronomical Apple exhibit originated. 
"Our support group FOTO wished to make a two-thousand-dollar con- 
tribution and asked if we could suggest an appropriate gift. I suggested 
the Apple. 

"The idea was that we would use the Apple for word processing, 
astronomical calculations, and maintaining mailing lists," says Mos- 
ley. "And we would use it to develop programs that the public could 
operate." 

With these goals in mind, and one gift Apple in hand, the observatory 
acquired a second Apple to put in the museum exhibit. The group has 
since acquired a third Apple and has plans to expand the exhibit this fall. 

"Because we get crowds around the present exhibit, in the fall we'll 
have two Apples out there, each with identical programs," Mosley says. 

Griffith Observatory uses its third Apple for a myriad of tasks. 

"We're an astronomical information center and people with the 
craziest requests call us," Mosley says. "If a question is astronomical 
and reasonable, we try to answer it. 

"We've gotten questions about things like the exact date of the New 
Moon in September 1692, from someone who's doing a history of the 
Salem witchcraft trials, or the precise position on the horizon where the 
sun will rise in Portland next month. 

"We also require a fair bit of information ourselves. We publish a 
magazine— TTze Griffith Observer — with astronomical information in the 
back. Much of this information comes to us from commercially available 
sources, but much of it is calculated here." 

Where To Look. The back page of The Griffith Observer is filled 
with useful information for star-gazers, on such subjects as the 
movements of the sun, phases of the moon, and locations and times to 
observe the planets (and even some of their moons). 

"When someone calls in for information on sunrise, sunset, and 
twilight times, we use printouts that we've prepared for the year on the 
Apple. Those are common questions." 

A partial list of the programs used by Mosley and the observatory 



staff— acquired from a variety of sources— reveals just how extensive are 
the uses to which the Apple is put. 

Altitudes and azimuths are calculated using programs created by a 
Canadian planetarium director. Bill Peters. Calendar conversions 
(Jewish, Gregorian, Julian) are made with Calendar Conversions, writ- 
ten by New York programmer Charles Kluepfel. The positions of the 
constellations at a given time may be determined using Northern Constel- 
lations, which was created by San Diego programmer Brad Schaper. 
Their outlines may be found in the Star Gazer's Guide, from Synergistic 
Software. Coordinate conversions are made using Tellstar, from Infor- 
mation Unlimited Software, another commercial program, and days be- 
tween dates are calculated using Calendar, or Calendar Moon Dates, 
from Call -A. P. P. I.E. 

Data on the distances between major cities of the world or between 
any two points on Earth, elements of a lunar eclipse, even exposure 
times for photographing the moon, planets, sun, and objects in outer 
space, are all kept on Apple disks. 

From the volcanic plume simulation of Jupiter's fiery moon lo, found 
on lo Plume (written by San Francisco State University geologist John 
Westfall), to the instructions for telling time by the stars, on Northern 
Constellations (from Call —A.P.P.L.E.), the library of Apple astronom- 
ical software used by the observatory is impressive. 

Astronomical Apples. Although no major astronomical discoveries 
have been directly attributed to the observatory's Apple, Mosley feels 
that microcomputers are moving rapidly into the scientific community, 
playing greater and more important roles. 

"We used the Apple when the comet IRAS-Araki-Alcock [named 
after its three codiscoverers— the Infra Red Astronomy Satellite and the 
Japanese and English amateur astronomers Araki and Alcock] was 
discovered suddenly a few months ago," says Mosley. "We got the or- 
bital elements [characteristics of the orbit] for it from the Harvard- 
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, a station on the Harvard cam- 
pus that coordinates such things— surprising new astronomical events. 
With a program called Epheneris , written by Sky and Telescope 
magazine editor Rodger Sinnott, we were able to run off the coordinates 
of where the comet would be in the sky. We then gave the news stations 



OCTOBER 1983

GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY 




and the public this information, providing the coordinates to people in 
places as far away as Alaska and Australia. 

"We also have a hot-line number that gives astronomical information 
about what's currently happening in the sky," continues Mosley. 
"When some unexpected event is occurring, we can put that information 
out very quickly, changing the message every day. During IRAS-Araki- 
Alcock's appearance, information on the orbital position of the cornet 
and how to find it was updated daily from data provided by the Apple. 
We received about seven hundred phone calls a day during the time of 
the comet." 

The Jupiter Effect and Other Flights of Fancy. Another applica- 
tion for the observatory's Apple is the discrediting of outdated or super- 
stitious beliefs. 

"We did a planetarium show last spring on the Jupiter Effect, which 
is the crazy theory that the earth is going to be destroyed by earthquakes 
because of an alignment of planets. As part of the planetarium show, we 
wanted to take the alignment that was happening in November of last 
year and see how often this sort of alignment has occurred." 

Mosley explains how this was accomplished. "We have a program 
that shows the solar system as seen from high above the elliptic plane, 
with the planets' orbits mapped out. We set the orbits for the current date 
and then ran the program so it traced the orbits back ten years. I looked 
for alignments, counted them off, and incorporated the information in 
the show." 

Similar alignments, Mosley discovered, had occurred eight times in 
ten years. None had an appreciable effect on the earth's well-being. 

Since the dawn of intelligence the elusive glittering specks in the 
night sky have captured the thoughts and imaginations of humankind. 
And for nearly half a century the Griffith Observatory has watched the 
skies, bringing new awareness to anyone who cared to learn more about 
the cosmic mysteries that surround us. 

And so, while the eternal movements of the cosmos are being 
watched by people like those who staff the Griffith Observatory, it's 
reassuring to know that those movements are also being observed by the 
Apple.

Unless otherwise noted, all products can be assumed to run on either Apple II, 
with 48K, ROM Applesoft, and one disk drive. The requirement for ROM Ap- 
plesoft can be met by RAM Applesoft in a language card. Many Apple II programs 
will run on the Apple III in the emulator mode. 

If the cryptic initials at the ends of reviews don't fit staff (listed on page 4), 
then they refer to guest reviewers— this month, Lucas X. Bozek, William H. Har- 
rington, Forrest Johnson, Sharon Stea, and Ethan Winer. 

Word Juggler He and Lexicheck lie. By Tim Gill. A few months ago 
Apple Writer lie rocketed like a shooting star to the top of the Bestsellers. 
It surpassed Screen Writer II, which had been the premier word proc- 
essor on the Apple II; Choplifter, the arcade game that had held the 
number one spot with surprising tenacity since its release; and VisiCalc, 
perhaps the all-time bestselling Apple program. To what does Apple 
Writer He owe its sudden burst of popularity? Primarily to the fact that it 
was the first full-featured word processor written sp)ecifically for the new 
machine. Therefore, what is astounding about Word Juggler He is that it 
convinces you the Apple He was created especially for it, not the other 
way around. 

Word Juggler, Quark's highly acclaimed word processor, started out 
life on the Apple HI and apparently wasn't going to come down to the n 



until the Apple 11 was ready. Word Juggler gives the impression that 
you're working with a dedicated word processor — or as close to that as 
you can get. Think about how nice it would be to have labeled command 
keys instead of all those control commands to memorize. Obviously, 
Word Juggler He can't give you a bank of keys for all of its editing func- 
tions, but it can and does give you the labels. A set of nineteen keycaps is 
included with the program, along with a key tool to help you install 
them. The keycaps are identical to the Apple lie keys except for the 
Word Juggler commands printed unobtrusively on the front. 

Most word processors rely on mnemonic command keys to help you 
remember what the editing commands are, but sometimes you can't 
remember if you need control-S for search or control-F for find. What's 
worse, sometimes you can't remember if control-P means print or purge. 
With labels on the keys, you don't have to remember. Besides that. Word 
Juggler He eschews obfuscation still further by arranging commands in 
logical groups. For instance, all the block operations are together. More 
important, all the delete commands are in one place. After all, it doesn't 
do to mistake those for anything else. The end result of these key con- 
siderations is that Word Juggler He is one of the most leamable word 
processors there is.

If your printer has the capabilities, the program also makes underlin- 
ing, boldfacing, superscripting, and subscripting easy. The open-apple 
key and a lower-case "u," for instance, insert an inverse "u" at the cur- 
sor location to turn on underlining. Turning off underlining is done the 
same way, except with a capital "U." 

Formatting commands are as easy to learn as editing conunands. A 
strip of plastic placed over the top row of keys reminds you of all the 
printout options and how to get them. Just hit escape followed by the ap- 
propriate top-row key. The command is inserted into your document at 
the cursor location and there's no mistaking it for text because it's in in- 
verse lettering. This way, you have complete and easy control over such 
things as spacing, pitch, justification, margins, and all the usual things. 

Then there are the unusual things— like variables. Word Juggler He 
can read data from Quick File Hot PFS.File, put the data into variables, 
and print multiple copies of a document with different information on 
each. Or you can make a data list on Word Juggler He itself. Variables 
can also be defined within the document being printed. Or, if Word Jug- 
gler He can't find a definition for a variable that is used, it will interrupt 
printing to ask you for the value. The obvious use for these capabilities is 
form letters, but there are related features that go beyond the level of the 
obvious. You can make entire paragraphs print or not print based on the 
value of one of the variables with a function much like Basic's if-then- 
else. Even format commands can be conditional. 

Then there's the document insert command. Just put a file name into 
your document and another document will be inserted at printout time. 
You can do this as many times as you like, which means that you can 
create printed documents as long as you want with neither the hassle of 
learning WPL — as you would have to do with Apple Writer — nor the 
limitation on the number of files that Screen Writer imposes. 

One pesky thing about using your word processor to write letters is 
that it's harder to make the envelope address come out right than it is to 
make the letter look good. For this reason, some people still resort to us- 
ing an archaic device called a typewriter to address the envelope. Word 
Juggler He makes addressing the envelope less work instead of more. 
Just slide the envelope into your printer, move the cursor to the name and 
address at the top of the letter, and hit a key to transmit that line to the 
printer. Hit it again for each line of the address and you're done. If it's an 
informal letter and you haven't put the address at tiie top. Word Juggler 
He also has a straight typing mode, so the address still doesn't have to be 
a hassle. 

Cursor movement is pretty simple. The four arrow keys do most of 
the work. When shifted, they move a word left or right, or a screen up or 
down. Control-shifted, they move the cursor to the beginning or the end 
of the line, or the top or bottom of text. 

If you know anything about programming and ASCII codes, you may 
be wondering how an arrow key, which is a control character, can be 
shifted or control-shifted and look any different. This little piece of 
magic can be attributed to a hardware adaptation that comes with Word 
Juggler He. It works basically on the same principle as the shift-key 
modification on the Apple II Plus. That means that the program can read 
the control and shift keys independently of the rest of the keyboard. After 
all, if you're going to bring a program down from the Apple HI, you 
want to bring it down with all its features intact. 

Many word processors display things on-screen the way they'll ap- 
pear on the printout, with justification, indents, page breaks, and so on. 
That's great, but if you want to write something in more than eighty col- 
umns some of these programs will make you scroll left and right to see 
the whole thing. That makes reading the document difficult. Never- 
theless, some people like to see how the document will appear in its final 
form. Word Juggler He offers a good alternative: You edit in eighty col- 
umns. Then, to see what the printout will look like, you hit a key to 
display the document. The display follows the format commands you 
have inserted, so you'll see the margins, justification, indents, page 
breaks, and so on. If you've set a width greater than eighty characters, 
you can scroll the document left and right to see it all. Text that is 
underlined, boldfaced, superscripted, or subscripted is shown in inverse. 

Word Juggler He operates under ProDOS, the new disk operating 
system for the Apple He that Apple announced a few months ago and will 
release a few months hence. This means that there could be a few dif- 
ficulties in file compatibility with other programs, except that Quark has 
taken care of the important ones. Word Juggler He is capable of loading 
DOS text files or Apple Pascal files. If you want to convert the other 



way, Word Juggler He won't do it, but ProDOS will when it's released. 

Word Juggler's association with ProDOS has more important im- 
plications for the business user. For one thing, it's completely file- 
compatible with Apple III SOS. For another, when ProDOS is released, 
it will allow you to use Apple's hard disk drive, the ProFile, with Word 
Juggler He. 

As a companion to Word Juggler He, Quark offers Lexicheck He to 
check your spelling. Lexicheck's greatest virtue is that it acts like part of 
Word Juggler He; just put the dictionary disk in the drive and press a spe- 
cial command key and Lexicheck He will go into action. Words that it 
can't find in its fifty-thousand-word vocabulary are shown in context, 
and you have the choice of accepting them or changing them. If you 
change a word that appears more than once, it changes all of the occur- 
rences of that word. When it's done, Lexicheck He puts you back into 
Word Juggler He. It couldn't be simpler to operate. If you have special 
terms or jargon that you use frequently, you can construct an auxiliary 
dictionary of those terms. You enter a word into the extra dictionary by 
hitting a special key when the main dictionary flags the word. That way 
you won't accidentally duplicate any words already covered in the main 
dictionary. 

Word Juggler alone is a terrific word processor. With Lexicheck it 
goes a long way toward error-proofing your written work, and both pro- 
grams are well reconmiended. Quark distinguished itself with a fine line 
of computer software for the Apple HI. We hope that these two programs 
are only the first of many that Quark will bring out for the Ap- 
ple ne. t)D

companies are now putting photos of actual screens from the game 
somewhere on their packages. But it was up to Electronic Arts and The 
Last Gladiator to give us a back-cover screen illustration that does not 
look as good as the actual game. Instead, it resembles a game for the 
Atari VCS— and an old one at that. 

Why any company would want to fool you into thinking theirs is a lo- 
res game is anyone's guess. When you boot up the game, however, you 
go toe to toe with some charming little hi-res monsters inside an imagi- 
nary coliseum. You can start with a gun (you brave warrior, you), but 
your increasing gladiatorial prowess will soon require you to trade it in 
for a club, then a javelin, then a trident, and finally a boomerang. In a 
nifty antisexist flourish, you can choose to be either a gladiator or gladia- 
trix, in addition to choosing your starting level and weapon. 

Upon entering the arena, you can tell immediately who in the crowd 
is for you and who is against you. Smiling faces and frowning faces give 
it away. Don't waste time thinking about that, however. Run to your 
weapon and pick it up before the gate lifts, unleashing your first oppo- 
nent. Typical enemies are octopi, spiders, robots, snakes, and vampires, 
which shift from bat to humanoid and back. From there, the roster goes 
on through some mercifully nameless species. With almost all of them, 
the best strategy is to move when the gate starts to come up, then ace 
them with extreme dispatch. Otherwise, it can get very hot and crowded 
in the arena. In scenarios where retrieving a thrown weapon is a require- 
ment, you'll want room to maneuver. 

By themselves, none of your foes are particularly formidable once 
you get to know them. The only entity you'll want to maintain a respect- 
ful distance from is the snake. It has to be hit just right, and repeatedly. 
Otherwise it'll keep coming— growing longer and longer or splitting into 
more snakes. Hmm . . . sounds like an earthworm. 

The point is, an okay game from Electronic Arts is the equivalent of 
something outstanding from just about anyone else. The graphics and 
animation of The Last Gladiator, while certainly superior to what's on 
the package, are adequate to the task and a professional job, but no more. 
The play is the thing here. The variety of monsters and the novelty of 
close combat in a genre where battle has been previously characterized

Accounts Receivable. In today's business world, being able to access a 
wide variety of information about your company's accounts receivable is 
an invaluable management tool. For example, knowing how much cash 
your company can expect to receive to meet the week's financial obli- 
gations or being able to check a customer's accounts without searching 
through a pile of papers could come in handy, to say the least. 

State of the Art's Accounts Receivable is one module of an integrated 
accounting system designed to take the paper shuffling out of business. 
All modules in the system can be used independently or in conjunction 
with each other. 

The accounts receivable module takes a bit of time to set up, but the 
effort is worth it considering the module makes so many reports and out- 
put records available. 

In addition to the basic information that must be entered to run the 
program. Accounts Receivable allows for a division file, terms code file, 
sales tax file, and salesperson file. The last can keep commission rec- 
ords for twenty-five salespeople that can be called up in order to look at 
sales trends or for periodic checks on salespersons' activities and 
customer contacts. 

In addition to making day-to-day accounting easier and more stream- 
lined, the program offers a variety of valuable reports. Among these are 
a sales journal, a general ledger detail report, a cash receipts journal, a 
customer listing, and an aged invoice report, which tracks open and paid 
invoices. 

The module also provides a customer sales analysis with month and 
year-to-date figures, a service charge journal, a sales tax report, and a 
salesperson commission report with month and year-to-date sales and 
commissions. Other reports print customer statements and labels and in- 
dicate accounts sold by each salesperson. With access to so many 
reports, the user can quickly obtain an almost endless variety of informa- 
tion about the status of cash flow, customer accounts, sales activities, 
and other operations fundamental to the business. 

If desired. Accounts Receivable can be interfaced with the General 
Ledger program, and receivables will be directly posted to the General 
Ledger. It may also be linked to other modules in the system, such as 
Sales Invoicing and Inventory Control, among others. 

In any case, whether used alone or with other modules. State of the 
Art's Accounts Receivable is a program whose design, ease of use, and 
packaging combine to make it a worthy complement to its company 
name. SS i

Cubit. By Abe Oswal. A pyramid of cubes and clean geometric lines and 
planes. But they're the wrong color. One conscientious little critter can 
change them, just by bouncing on them. A gremlin can change them too, 
but he's more imp than conscience; he changes them back to what they 
shouldn't be. 

And someone keeps dropping lethal gumdroplike balls down the! 
steps. Occasionally, a ball is not a ball but is a snake, or becomes one on 
the bottom cube. Balls are mindless, but snakes stalk their victim— which 
is, of course, the conscientious little critter. 

It has another name in the arcades, and still another on another com- 
puter, but the principle's the same: a solid, well-thought-out strategy ar- 
cade game. Manual dexterity is required, although not necessarily as 
refined as that needed for shoot- 'em-ups, eat-'em-ups, or busy-work 
games. And skillful fingers won't do a bit of good beyond the first few 
screens without clear strategy. 

Micromax's clean-lined graphics emphasize the strategy rather than 
the arcade. Bells and whistles are sparse, although well-used sounds add 
to the playability. The company has taken care to plan the use of colors to 
make the game as playable on monochrome monitors as on color ones. 
Also absent and not missed are delays between levels or between ending 
and restart; it's all instant. Escape is available if respite you must have. 

An adult, well-made interpretation of a good game. Cubit rests its 
case. If you were the jury and had to give back the game once you'd an-

Beagle Basic. By Mark Simonsen. Evolution leaves us all behind. In the 
mechanics of survival of the fittest, only those traits that are counter to 
survival are weeded out. Traits that assist in survival are accentuated. 
However, old organs such as the once-useful appendix never disappear. 

Computer hardware, when it's no longer needed, usually disappears. 
You don't see many RF modulators around anymore. Once they roamed 
these hills in the thousands. There's a generation of kids growing up to- 
day that have never seen a one- wire shift-key modification. And yet, 
computers have their vestigial organs. The Apple He still has cassette 
ports and a sixteen-pin game I/O connector; you won't see many people 
using those in a year or two. But most of the Apple lie's genetic hand- 
me-downs reside in firmware. 

Applesoft has remained virtually unchanged since it came down from 
cassette to live in ROM. Since the arrival of DOS, however, some of Ap- 
plesoft has become dormant. The code remains, but the ftinctions have 
atrophied from inactivity. 

Evolution would let it stay. 

A systems programmer, however, would throw it out and put 
something worthwhDe in its place. A ROM is a terrible thing to waste. 

Well, actually, a ROM is a difficult thing to convince people to 
replace. This is primarily because a chip-pulling tool looks like 
something a dentist would use, so people are afraid of it. With the bank- 
switched memory (the upper 16K) in the lie and the widespread use of 
RAM cards in the U Plus, why not move the whole language into that 
RAM and fiddle with its genetic code there? (Zat vay, Herr Doktor, we 
can vipe it all out if ze experiments go astray.) (Good thinking, Igor.) 

This is precisely what Mark Simonsen has done with Beagle Basic. 
And so as not to leave you out of the fun. Beagle Basic offers a mass of 
new commands, tells you which old commands they replace, and lets you 
choose between them. When you are done. Beagle Basic saves the 
hybrid language to disk under the Orwellian name Newbasic. 

The reason that each command added must replace a previous com- 
mand is that Newbasic takes up the same space as Applesoft. It also uses 
the same tokens for its keywords, and there are a limited number of 
values that can be used as tokens. Unlike some utilities that expand Ap- 
plesoft's repertoire, Beagle Basic doesn't use the ampersand command. 

This is nice because it makes Newbasic programs more memory- 
efficient. And the Newbasic routines use no more memory than that 
which they replace. This is not to downplay the usefulness of ampersand 
routines; they are still much more flexible in the kinds of enhancements 
they can add to Applesoft than Beagle Basic is. One more nice thing 
about Beagle Basic, however, is that it still allows you to use ampersand 
routines. 

The most needed of the commands you can substitute into Newbasic 
is else, the prodigal son of if-then. Else lets your conditional commands 
take a special action if the condition is false, instead of just moving on to 
the next line. Using else can help to clarify a lot of otherwise twisted 
logic. Another useful new command is swap, which trades the values of 
two variables without the use of a temporary variable. This can speed up 
sort routines, as well as preventing the creation of garbage strings, and 
the new tone command allows you to make sounds of a specified pitch 
and duration. 

A clever feature of Beagle Basic is that the most useful new com- 
mands replace the least important old commands. The three commands 
mentioned earlier replaced the cassette shload, load, and save. Some of 
the less significant Newbasic commands replace things like wait and the 
lo-res commands. 

Other Newbasic commands perform such functions as reading a pixel 
on the hi-res screen, scrolling the text screen down, clearing the 
keyboard buffer, and allowing you to use text page two and lo-res 
page two. 

There are three groups of commands offered to replace lo-res 
capabilities. You use only one of these groups in any version of 
Newbasic. (Of course, you can create as many versions of Newbasic as 
you like.) One group offers commands that clear to the end of the line, 
clear to the end of the page, scroll the screen up, and ring the bell. The 
second group gives you control over graphics and text screen switches, 
and the third group allows you to move the cursor in four directions. All 



of these groups are things that can be done with unmodified Applesoft, 
but not as easily. 

Beagle Basic also allows you to use variables to indicate the line 
numbers in goto and gosub commands. This practice can get you into 
trouble, however, when you renumber programs, so be careful. You can 
also change the sound of the bell and the appearance of the escape editing 
cursor. The bell change is cosmetic but the editing cursor is useful, since 
there is currently no visual way to tell whether you are in editing mode or 
not, unless you are using a He in eighty-column mode. 

Finally, Beagle Basic offers you the opportunity to change command 
names and error messages. There may or may not be much point in doing 
that, but it can be kind of fun, as Beagle's earlier bestseller DOS Boss 
proved. 

Beagle Basic is well implemented — an easy-to-use inventive ap- 
proach to an old problem. And there's no denying that "Typing Goof! 
(peep)" is more fun than "?Syntax Error (beep)."

Stickybear Basketbounce. By Richard Hefter and Jamie and Steve 
Worthington. The button-down bear strikes back. Nattily attired in a 
blue serge suit, the hottest star in the educational game firmament is 
clearly enjoying himself in this purely escapist entertainment. Evidently 
ready for a more whimsical outing after his impressive educational per- 
formances in Numbers and ABC, Stickybear displays in Basketbounce a 
physical grace and dynamic screen presence previously only hinted at. 

With nothing but a series of large baskets, he nimbly maneuvers 
under a series of industrial outfall ducts, keeping the environment free of 
excess bouncing bricks, balls, doughnuts, rubber stars, and assorted 
other detritus of arcade factory production. His leaps, at the touch of a 
button or space bar, would shame Nureyev. They are necessitated by the 
inevitability of uncaught objects, which remain to become navigational 
hazards. 

As advertised, this is a game for the whole family. Sixteen screens of 
increasing difficulty pass by before the game switches back to the begin- 
ning; and it will be a long time before anybody sees them all. The game

is aimed primarily at children (stickers and a mobile included), apparent- 
ly because the graphics are big, clean, and colorful, and there is no 
shooting, squishing, hacking, or stabbing. In fact, the only penalty for 
failure is the sight of S.B. being dumped on his can and ultimately

Write Away. By Doug Stinson. There have got to be more word proc- 
essors than any other type of Apple business program. Write Away is a 
relatively new entry in that crowded marketplace; however, it has 
capabilities that should distinguish it from the pack. The program is full- 
featured and powerful, yet it can also introduce beginners to the benefits 
of electronic editing. And it accomplishes this without getting bogged 
down in esoteric ramblings. 

Write Away features five tutorials, each applicable to the various 
phases of text editing. Its capabilities include managing a mailing list, in- 
terfacing with VisiCalc DIF files, and utilizing predefined macros- 
words, phrases, or lines of text that may be represented by a single 
keystroke. For example, you could define the "s" key to print "Sincere- 
ly, John Doe" every time you pressed it. A lawyer, on the other hand, 
may decide to set up the "e" key to automatically type "the estate of." 
For phrases that occur frequently throughout a text, the macro feature 
can save time and tedium. In fact, it is one of the most powerful at- 
tributes of Write Away. 

Unfortunately, the more a program is capable of doing, the more the 
user is required to learn. This holds true for Write Away, but at least the 
multitude of editing and printing conmiands are represented by logical 
key sequences. For those who struggled learning WordStar, this is in- 
deed a welcome relief! 

Write Away\ text may be viewed in a variety of ways. The user can 
tab through it a letter at a time, a word at a time, by paragraph, or even 
by pages. The document may also be searched for the occurrence of a 



"Compared to other checkbook programs,

particular word or phrase, and that phrase can be replaced with another, 
depending upon whether certain criteria are true. For example, if the 
name at the beginning of a form letter includes the prefix "Miss" or 
"Mrs.", then all references to "he," "him," or "his" will automati- 
cally be changed to "she," "her," or "hers." Pretty neat, huh? Those 
logical operators can be used in a variety of combinations although they 
are advanced features and need not be mastered to use the program. 

Waiting for the disk drive to load the next module is one of the most 
annoying attributes of any computer program. Write Away avoids the 
finger tapping. Although it is a large program divided into two modules, 
Write Away will automatically recognize the existence of a memory ex- 
pansion card and load the printer driver program there. In this way, the 
entire program is live in memory at one time, and the user need never 
wait to continue working. To increase operating speed the program also 
includes a special fast disk routine that will save or load a document in 
about one-third the time Apple DOS takes. 

Since the word processor uses standard Apple text files to store 
documents, it may also be used to create exec files or to edit Applesoft 
programs. Its ability to read only a particular record from a random ac- 
cess file should be of interest to programmers. In addition, data and text 
files from other programs may be converted to Write Away's format us- 
ing one of several translator programs. This capability can facilitate 
editing other people's work. Coupling the mailing list ability with the in- 
telligent replace option and a VisiCalc template, an enterprising cor- 
porate manager could write a standard quarterly report once and never 
have to touch it again. As the facts and figures changed each period, the 
appropriate sentences and paragraphs could be included or omitted with 
each printing. Meanwhile, Fred Powertrip can be out drinking beer 
while his Epson does all the work! 

Error-trapping is delightfully complete as well. All efforts to delete 
locked files, edit nonexistent text, or enter inappropriate commands are 
dutifully rejected. A warning is printed before any action that could 
cause the loss of a file, and the user is required to answer whether or not 
he wishes to complete the action before proceeding. Even pressing 
"reset" simply returns control to the previous menu. 

But perhaps the most important aspect of Write Away is the lack of 
copy protection. With word processors, it is essential to be able to make 
safety copies of the original, and then to be able to rewrite the printing 
format and printer control codes back to these copies, without fear of 
damaging the master disk. 

All told, there are so many positive features incorporated into Write 
Away that it would be hard not to recommend it for use in business, or by 
any serious student or professional writer. EW

Geopoiitique 1990. By Bruce A. Ketchledge. 

Another late night at the White House. The usual gang was sitting 
around drinking coffee and watching television. It was a live transmis- 
sion from Japan. Angry Japanese were throwing rocks at the U. S. em- 
bassy. As the top officials of the U.S. government watched, the mob 
broke into the building and started throwing files into the street. Then 
they found an American flag and burned it for the camera. In the 
background, Japanese police watched with amused expressions. 

The secretary of state got up and turned the set off. "Well, that's 
that, ' ' he said. ' 'We can 't do much but send a protest, and I don 't think 
the new government will pay much attention. I told you it was a bum idea 
to put a bug in the emperor's teapot. " 

The secretary of defense said, ' 'It was just a freak accident. We 
couldn 't have known it was going to come loose and fall into the Indone- 
sian ambassador's cup during a reception. " 

' 7 think Borostov is behind this, ' ' said the national security advisor. 
"His slogan is, 'Erode the U.S. geopolitical position now!' " 

"Ouch, " said the secretary of the treasury. "Those Ruskies need 
some better slogans. 

' 7 don 't think you can blame it all on the Russians, ' ' the secretary of 
state said. "I've had nothing but trouble from our so-called allies since 
we invaded Mexico. ' ' 

The secretary of defense winced. "Let's not bring up that again. 
We 've got a problem here. We 'II have to pull our troops all the way back 
to Hawaii unless we can find some new bases. 

"Suppose we asked Red China for bases on the mainland?" the rui- 
tional security advisor asked.

Can acomputer make you cry? 



Right now, no one knows. This is 
partly because many would consider 
the very idea frivolous. But it's also 
because whoever successfully ans- 
wers this question must first have 
answered several others. 

Why do we cry? Why do we 
laugh, or love, or smile? What are the 
touchstones of our emotions? 

Until now, the people who asked 
such questions tended not to be 
the same people who ran software 
companies. Instead, they were 
writers, filmmakers, painters, musi- 
cians. They were, in the traditional 
sense, artists. 

H We're about to change that 
tradition. The name of our company 
is Electronic Arts. 

Software WORTHY 

OF THE MINDS THAT 

USE IT We are a new association 
of electronic artists united by a com- 
mon goal — to fulfill the enormous 
potential of the personal computer. 

In the short term, this means 
transcending its present use as a facili- 
tator of unimaginative tasks and 
a medium for blasting aliens. In the 
long term, however, we can expect 
a great deal more. 

These are wondrous machines 
we have created, and in them can be 
seen a bit of their makers. It is as if 
we had invested them with the image 
of our minds. And through them, we 
are learning more and more about 
ourselves. 

M We learn, for instance, that we 
are more entertained by the involve- 
ment of our imaginations than 
by passive viewing and listening. We 
learn that we are better taught by 
experience than by memorization. 
And we learn that the traditional 



distinctions — the ones that are made 
between art and entertainment and 
education — don't always apply. 

TOWARD A LANGUAGE 

OF DREAMS. In short, we 
are finding that the computer can be 
more than just a processor of data. 

It is a communications medium: 
an interactive tool that can bring 
people's thoughts and feelings closer 
together, perhaps closer than ever 
before. And while fifty years from 
now, its creation may seem no more 
important than the advent of motion 
pictures or television, there is a 
chance it will mean something more. 

Something along the lines of 
a universal language of ideas and 
emotions. Something like a smile. 

The first publications of Electronic 
Arts are now available. We suspect 
you'U be hearing a lot about them. 
Some of them are games like you've 
never seen before, that get more 
out of your computer than other 
games ever have. Others are harder 
to categorize — and we like that. 

WATCH US . We're providing 
a special environment for talented, 
independent software artists. It's 
a supportive environment, in which 
big ideas are given room to grow. 
And some of America's most re- 
spected software artists are beginning 
to take notice. 

We think our current work reflects 
this very special commitment. 
And though we are few in number 
today and apart from the main- 
stream of the mass software market- 
place, we are confident that both 
time and vision ^ j-^ — _

Skyforth 1.1. By Thomas J. Tosch. This is a Forth operating system for 
the Apple. It includes the programming language Forth and a number of 
special capabUities: an on-board tone generator, an editor, an assembler, 
built-in sorting routines, and the capability of using special character 
sets. If you think your Apple is powerful now, wait till you see what it 
can do with Skyforthl 

But before we get into that, a word of caution: Forth is an odd lan- 
guage. The people who have worked with it tend to be very passionate 
about it. Some of them love it and some hate it, but nobody thinks it's 
just okay. You can start an argument at a programmers' meeting just by 
mentioning the name. This is partly because Forth requires you to learn 
new thinking habits. It's similar to assembly language in that its logic is 
closely related to the logic of the hardware itself— which is both good and 
bad from a progranmier's viewpoint. 

The good part is that this gives the programmer tremendous power. If 
the logic you use in your program is closely related to the logic of the 
computer it runs on, you can do large and powerful things with small and 
simple programs; your programs will run faster and take less memory 
space. The Apple doesn't have to waste time translating its thoughts into 
human-type language and then translating your thoughts into ma- 
chine code. 

The bad part, of course, is that you have to do all that translating 
yourself. You have to learn to think in patterns similar to those the 
machine uses and then write those patterns into your programs. You 
have to do quite a lot of work before you can take advantage of the power

of Forth. As the ancient wise man said, "There's no such thing as a 
free lunch!" 

Skyforth is not a Forth tutorial, but if you're already familiar with the 
language, it is a very comfortable environment to work in. The system 
dictionary is large and well chosen, and it can be extended with a variety 
of utility routines. Most of these are included in source code form, so 
you can examine them with the editor to see how they work. 

Unlike some other versions of Forth, Skyforth fits neatly into the Ap- 
ple operating system, making a combination that has the best features of 
both. It either supports or replaces most Applesoft and DOS conmiands, 
sometimes with significant improvements. We caimot begin to cover all 
of the goodies, but here are some high points. 

In high-resolution graphics, you have all the usual Apple capabilities 
and some new ones. In addition to vector shapes, you can have block 
shapes (rectangular, any size, defined by bit patterns — intricate anima- 
tion figures, and so on) and character shapes (block shapes the size of 
ASCn characters — in other words, special character sets). You can work 
on one hi-res screen while you display the other and toggle between 
them at will. Best of all, these routines operate at assembly language 
speeds— /as?. 

Speaking of fast, the system has a special "load from disk and run" 
mode that is starding, if you're used to DOS speeds. This technique re- 
quires you to do your own DOS bookkeeping, but the speed advantage is 
worth it. And if that's still not fast enough for you, there's a version of 
Skyforth that works with a hard disk in addition to DOS. Another ver- 
sion supports an arithmetic processor, if you want ultrafast number 
crunching. 

But we haven't space to describe all the goodies. Let's just say that 
Skyforth is an elegant marriage of Forth and the Apple. If you're looking 
for a Forth system with extras, you ought to investigate this one. IK

Parthian Kings. By David W. Bradley. In feudal times, land meant 
power. This tenet is re-created today in city-state warfare for one to four 
players. Set in the mythical kingdom of Parthia, a land complete with 
kings, wizards, and a host of fantastic creatures, Parthian Kings allows 
players to create a fantasy world filled with lusty battle and shrewd 
shrewd strategy in a land where magic is your best friend or your worst 
enemy. 

The players in Parthian Kings select which of four city-states will be 
their capital. Then the colorful hi-res towns suddenly grow into magnifi- 
cent citadels with the player's flag fluttering from the ramparts. Players 
can design and save their armies, selecting from five unit types. The 
characteristics that vary from type to type are strength, armor, weapons 
range, and movement. After the units are selected, the computer 
automatically computes the cost of each. Stronger, faster units are a 
greater burden to the poor, overtaxed peasants. 

Parthian Kings allows players to create and save their own unique 
battlefields with various terrain types, including clear areas, forests, 
lakes, and impassable mountains. Avalon Hill has included one scenario 
map on the disk. 

Game play begins with players choosing between a fight to the finish 
and a short game limited to a fixed number of turns. Next, players are 
given the option to use the magic of the kingdom's resident wizard. With 
a wave of his wand, terrain changes instantiy or the strength of a friend 
or foe waxes or wanes. Of course, even a wizard can have a bad day, so 
spells don't always work as intended. As your wizard gains experience, 
he learns new and more powerful spells. 

During each turn, players are given a report of the current census, tax 
rate, and number of armed divisions. Using the tax revenue of your 
kingdom, you raise armies and dispatch them to the front. As king, you 
set the tax rate, but if you get too greedy, your peasants might stage a tax 
revoh. 

In the strategy phase of each turn, players move their units. While 
units may not be stacked, they may be transported to the battle area in 
convoys. Combat is relatively unsophisticated; there's no way to select 
tactical attack or defense options for individual units. 

Strategy and tactics in Parthian Kings revolve primarily around the 
need to capture and occupy the opponent cities, but there are sociological 
considerations as well. Players must balance the need to expand the 
military with the need to sustain and nurture the city-state's economy. 
Captured city-states can provide further loot and resources. While magic

Font Downloader. By Bob Kovacs. When Apple released its Dot Ma- 
trix Printer, the manual contained tantalizing hints of a capability for 
printing with custom character sets. The demo program packaged with 
the printer, DMP Exerciser, had a menu selection for downloading a cus- 
tom character set to the printer; but alas, selecting that option brought 
only a message that the option was not yet available. It was possible to do 
it yourself, but it wasn't easy; the necessary control commands were 
discussed with great brevity and only on the reference card. For the most 
part, that was that. 

Except that someone was bound to figure it out sooner or later. Bob 
Kovacs seems to be the one who figured it out sooner. His Font Down- 
loader comes with four fonts ready to be loaded. Once loaded into the 
printer, a font can be used by any other program. It's even fairly easy to 
switch between the built-in font and the custom font with any word proc- 
essor that allows the insertion of control characters. 

The program also includes an editor, which works on the graphics 
screen. Any character can be selected from an array of the entire print- 
able character set (ASCII 32 through 127) and edited point by point. The 
editor uses keyboard input, making it easier to use than the DOS Tool Kit 
character editor. The character is edited on an eight-by-eight array, 
which is a difficult size to deal with. Uppwr-case letters typically use the 
top seven pixels of an array. Using fewer pixels makes certain letters 
look awkward. However, making the upper-case characters seven dots 
high leaves only one dot for descending lower-case letters without rais- 



ing the rest of those letters. 

So how come the printer's regular character set has ftdl descenders 
and good-looking capitals? A close look at a printout reveals that it uses 
a matrix that is nine dots high. And, in fact, it's possible to create custom 
characters on a nine-dot matrix, with one catch: Each character may be 
eight dots in height, but it can be the top set of eight or the bottom set. 
And no single character needs both the top and bottom rows. 

Unfortunately, Font Downloader doesn't take advantage of this 
feature. Nor does it provide for the sixteen-dot-wide characters that are 
also possible with the DMP. But it is a start, and it does allow you to 
print with a character set of your choice. In all fairness, the difference is 
only one dot; the program can do fonts with a higher resolution than the 
characters on your screen, and the editor, for what it does, is reasonably 
good. The program is, at least, a "good sooner." DO

Health- Aide. Everyone wants to stay healthy, but figuring out the best 
way to go about it can be a lot of work. It involves counting calories, re- 
membering all about what constitutes a balanced diet, and planning 
menus. It can mean reading a lot of diet books and learning some basic 
nutritional facts. It can also mean keeping track of what you've eaten, 
breaking it into calories, and analyzing it all. Then there's the question of 
exercise: trying to decide what's best to keep weight down and bum up 
calories. Usually, there are unique personal needs or problems involved: 
blood pressure, need to avoid salt, vitamin requirements. A great deal of 
information, planning, and work goes into creating a healthy diet and 
lifestyle. 

Health-Aide, a computerized comprehensive nutritional and health 
planning program, is intended to simplify, cut the time, and minimize the 
work of staying healthy. Once you've provided it with some personal in- 
formation, Health- Aide provides a listing of the RDAs (recommended 
dietary allowances) for nutrients in foods. 

When you've created this basic file, you can begin to create and track 
nutritional intake, exercise, and personal data on a daily, monthly, or 
yearly basis. 



The Ultimate Apple Disk Utilities 



The iNSPECTorAND Watson 



The Inspector is one of the most valuable additions 
I have made to my Apple. I use it almost daily in 
repairing blown disks, editing files, and many other 
uses. There are other disk access utihties on the 
market, but almost all require a separate program 
to be run. The Inspector is always available and 
easily accessed when in ROM. Likewise, if the disk 
version is used, it is always available if you boot the 
modified DOS. The documentation is excellent, and 
the product is superb. Rating AA. (Disk $59-95) 
Watson greatly expands the potential of the Inspec- 



tor. The utiUties of Watson are available in most 
cases through software, but from a variety of dif- 
ferent sources. Watson combines them all together 
in a convenient and powerful package that is always 
available. Since Watson must be used in conjunc- 
tion with the Inspector, the package as a whole 
must also be evaluated. Consequentiy, since the 
routines provided by both the Inspector and Watson 
are so useful and the documentation clear and well 
done, the overall package must be considered as 
outstanding. Rating AA. (Disk $49-95) ^ ^

You create a meal from a list of 700 foods, for which thirty-three nu- 
trient values are stored. Health-Aide provides a complete nutrient analy- 
sis of it, including a protein-analysis breakdown of the eight essential 
amino acids. Then it recommends foods to add to the meal if the protein 
is unbalanced. It also provides a readout of the percentage of the RDA 
being fulfilled. At the same time, it tracks four nutritional elements of 
your choice. The nutritional analysis is quite complete. The only essen- 
tial vitamins missing from it are vitamin D, PABA, and pantothenic acid; 
why these aren't included is a mystery. 

If losing weight is a goal, Health-Aide helps in a number of ways. It 
calculates energy expenditure for a variety of activities and total caloric 
use and comes up with a recommended caloric intake for losing weight. 
Setting up a diet becomes easy: Several well-balanced menus for break- 
fast, lunch, and dinner for seven different caloric values (from one thou- 
sand to three thousand calories a day) are provided. You can select from 
these and replace foods you don't like widi others from a food substitu- 
tion list. 

While planning menus, you can determine which foods are the best 
sources of nutrients and which are the cheapest. You can call up two lists 
of foods containing each nutrient; one is sorted on the basis of quality 
and the other by price. Also while preparing menus, Health-Aide makes 
a shopping list for the meals being planned, according to the number of 
eaters. It is also possible to add foods and create and store original 
menus. SS

Conquering Worlds. By Walter Hochbrueckner. With this summer's 
release of Return of the Jedi, everyone is excited about epic space battles 
and planet conquests. Conquering Worlds lets you in on the action. With 
a tip of the helmet to Fred Saberhagen's famous Berserker series. Con- 
quering Worlds pits you against a horde of invading robots who are bent 
on destroying all mankind and purging the universe of inferior creatures. 

Mankind is initially allocated one planet in a random star system. 
Each of the thirty-two star systems has between two and eight planets. 
The robots also start somewhere in the galaxy on a single planet. Now 
begins a game of cosmic leapfrog, as each side scrambles to gain control 
of every possible free planet in the universe. Landing on an empty planet 
is sufficient to gain control of that planet. The difficult part of accom- 
plishing that task is that the planets all have different orbits. For you to 
cross from one planet to another, the planets must be in the right con- 
junction. Otherwise the gravitational differential will prevent travel. 

At the beginning of a turn, each planet under your control receives a 
fresh allotment of ships. Then when an entire star system is under con- 
trol, bonus ships are awarded based upon the number of planets con- 
quered. Therefore, the systems with the most planets are the most im- 
portant militarily and economically. These are the systems that you 
should defend the most. In fact, proper defense is one of the most im- 
portant factors in winning Conquering Worlds. 

Just when you are having a great time empire-building, the robot 
fleets will start to descend upon your outer star systems. Your sphere of 
influence has just collided with theirs! Unless quick countermeasures are 
taken, star system after star system will fall before their onslaught. 

While Conquering Worlds is basically a strategy game, it also con- 
tains a simple arcade game. When the battle is joined with the robot 
fleets, the arcade game begins. Twin lasers move up and down the side 
of the screen firing, while enemy ships buzz around the screen like flies 
in a bottle. Each side gets a fixed time to eliminate as many opponents as 
possible. This battling continues until one side is vanquished. The main 
game is over when either all the worlds are conquered or all the enemies 
are destroyed. 

Conquering Worlds is somewhat difficult to learn because the gaming 
system is clumsy in spots. Also, the manual is woefully inadequate in ex- 
plaining how to do different things. 

Once the game is mastered, though, it is enjoyable and challenging. 
The computer is a worthy opponent, and it's deadly in the arcade rounds. 
When you have star wars in mind. Conquering Worlds might be your 
type of challenge. RUA

Mission: Escape! By Thomas Schumann. "It seems that we have met 
like this before. ..." The setting is space, the circumstance a rescue 
mission. The player half of us is a shuttlecraft pilot who must risk life 



and limb through streams of meteors, comets (small variety), and UFOs 
that are jeopardizing the very universe of the (good grief) Tweenies, in- 
habitants of a solar system of twelve planets called the . . . you really 
don't want to know. 

Tweenies obviously enjoy solitude; there's a population of precisely 
six shiploads per planet. These you must shr'tle to your extremely unco- 
operative — or simply incompetent — mothership. The trip from mom to 
planet is pretty much a dodging game, and landing properly is no hassle. 
But as soon as you begin ascending with your twitchy Tweenie, your 
mothership apparently begins moving to meet you; only she passes right 
by you, back and forth from one side of the screen to the other, and she's 
not forgiving at all, making it frustrating as all get-out to dock. 

On the way back you can shoot to disperse the rocks; of course, that 
doesn't help a whit with your recalcitrant mother. Shooting the rocks 
does score points, so it's possible to be distracted from your mission of 
mercy, which has nothing to do with getting even with the rocks. But, 
then, Tweenies aren't nearly as cute as little hostages, and they don't 
wave. 

Eventually, you must travel to all twelve planets, and the going gets 
rougher. Additional shuttlecrafts are a bonus for good scoring. There's 
no such thing as an old shuttlecraft in the Tweenies' end of the galaxy, 
folks; you're not apt to put very many miles on any particular ship. 

The graphics are okay, and so is the game. It's not one you play once 
and put away; it's enjoyable for some time— regardless of whether you 
ever make it back from the twelfth planet— while you develop your pilot- 
ing skills, timing, strategy, and patience. 

On the other hand, if you've had your Apple from day one, you've 
probably run into half a dozen of this game's siblings, though you can't 
remember where or when. LXB

manuscripts or correspondence, and one thing more: As the name sug- 
gests, it's comfortable to work with. 

Pen-Pal lets you enter text in the usual way, as if from a typewriter. 
For making corrections, you can move the cursor around with control- 
key commands to add or delete individual characters; or you can go into 
"command mode" and change whole blocks of text. When you type 
control-A, the prompt "CMD" appears on-screen, and the system waits 
for instructions instead of text. In this mode, you can add or delete (or 
move, copy, or store on disk) a whole block of text, previously marked. 
Pen-Pal also allows you to include formatting commands in the text: 
They will not be printed but will change the margins (or the spacing, or 
whatever) at a particular point in the document. 

The system works in either forty or eighty columns. If you don't have 
an eighty-column card, you can choose between two different displays: 
think mode and look mode. Think mode is for text entry. It shows you 
the complete text in forty-column format, with carriage returns and 
justification marks shown in inverse. Look mode is for checking the final 
version: It shows you the text as it will be printed. You can see only part 
of the page at a time, since you are looking through the screen, which 
isn't as wide as the page. However, you can easily move the window 
around the document with CMD keys or a joystick, so that's no problem. 

When you're satisfied with the text in look mode, you can print it us- 
ing the CMD mode. Unlike many word processors, Pen-Pal doesn't re- 
quire you to load a separate print program: The print coirmiand is part of 
text entry. Incidentally, this makes Pen-Pal a good choice if you have 
only one disk drive. You have to change disks only at the beginning of a 
session: when you take out the program disk and put in the data disk. For 
that matter, it's also a good choice if you have six or eight drives: It's 
easy to change both slot and drive numbers from within the program. 

This program is particularly gentle to the beginner; it has a lot of help 
available. There are five different tutorial screens listing the various 
commands and describing their functions. These are available at any 
time by simply going into CMD mode and typing the number of the 
screen you want. In addition, the program comes with three reference 
cards showing the various CMD and control-key functions. The cards 
show the commands pictorially and in table form for both the He and II 
Plus keyboards. With that kind of help, it's hard to get lost, but if you do, 
the publisher maintains a toll-free phone number to assist you. 

This system can also act as an editor for Applesoft programs, letting 
you apply all the capabilities of the word processor to writing your own 
software. Your program must be converted into a text file before the 
editor can read it, but Pen-Pal includes a short program for that conver- 
sion that is automatically added to every data disk during initialization. 

The system disk is copyable, so if catastrophe strikes you won't lose 
the system. 

If you have been putting off getting a word processor because you 
thought the good ones were too complicated or too expensive, you 
should try writing a letter to a Pen-Pal. IR

Sargon III. By Dan and Kathe Spracklen. There are some people you 
just can't keep down. The Spracklen team from San Diego certainly falls 
into that category. 

For those who've been word processing or zapping aliens and there- 
fore not paying attention to the rest of the world, the Spracklens are the 
premier authors of microcomputer chess programs. Their Sargon series 
has reigned supreme practically since the dawn of the microcomputer 
and they've either written or influenced most of the dedicated chess pro- 
grams on the market. 

But recently Sargon had fallen on hard times. Upstart Larry Atkin 
downloaded and rewrote a mainframe chess program that goes by the 
name of Chess 7. 0 on the Apple and it clearly stole the march from 
Sargon II. Sargon //continued to sell well, but Chess 7.0 was the elegant 
program. 

Sargon II had an Achilles' heel that had to do with the tradeoff be- 
tween speed and power. It could play bad chess fast or superior chess at 
a snail's pace. For the real chess aficionado, Sargon' s lower levels were 
too easy and its upper levels too slow. Chess 7.0, with fast response and 
a better game at the lower levels, seemed destined to eventually unseat 
the king. 

It now appears that Chess 7.0 has its work cut out for it. Sargon III 
rectifies the problems of Sargon II and adds palatable feature after palat- 



able feature to the basic program. 

But the saUent point is that Sargon ///plays good chess fast. No more 
dozing while Sargon contemplates its ROM chips in Buddha-like sereni- 
ty. This Sargon is quick-thinking and brash. Like its forebears, this ver- 
sion is stronger at fundamentally sound positional chess than at brilliant 
maneuvers that can turn a game around. Of course, that's the same faint 
praise with which the Russian grandmasters who dominate international 
chess are generally damned. 

Two of the major enhancements in this version are in the recognition 
of time and in the continued functioning of the program. 

Sargon III allots itself a time budget based on the level of play 
chosen, and it moves within that constraint. Thus, as in matches between 
humans, if it plays too slowly early on, it must hustle later— perhaps to 
its detriment. On the other hand, if it is able to use its extensive library of 
chess openings for several quick moves, it conserves time for later. This 
feature allows the user to simulate real chess tournament action— clock 
and all. 

Equally as important is the fact that Sargon III doesn't sit in an idle 
mode while you contemplate your next move. It continues to analyze the 
position, just as a human would, and is therefore better prepared to re- 
spond to its opponent's sallies. 

But playing good chess is just the beginning for this version of Sar- 
gon. There are one hundred seven classic games of the past on a separate 
disk that can be replayed for either instruction or entertaiimient. These 
games were chosen by life master Boris Baczynskyj and represent an ex- 
cellent compendium of classic games as well as lesser-known contests 
that contain excellent lessons. 

Baczynskyj also annotates a series of chess problems that are well 
chosen to highlight problem areas common to many chess players. The 
problems are interesting and challenging and add significant depth to the 
overall package. 

Just the fact that Sargon III plays faster would be enough for many of 
the dedicated Sargon fans. But the extra added attractions figure to make 
this version irresistible. ART

The Spy Strikes Back (or How To Not Be Seen). By Robert Hardy and 
Mark Pelczarski. The adventures of James Bond, secret agent 007 on 
Her Majesty's Secret Service, have provided moviegoers with vicarious 
thrills for two decades. Although they aren't considered high drama by 
anyone, and some Bond films are better than others, the series as a whole 
has demonstrated that a sequel need not be a second-rate effort that ex- 
ploits the success of its predecessors. 

So it is with The Spy Strikes Back. In fact, this new Penguin offering 
is considerably better than the earlier Spy's Demise. It may even be the 
best arcade game Penguin has published to date. 

This new spy thriller has elements of adventure, and, although it's 
certainly not the first game to flirt with the boundary between genres, it 
does so in a unique way. Playing on the arcade level, you must guide the 
same spy used in Spy 's Demise (truly a masterpiece of packing a lot of 
character into only a few pixels) through a grid of corridors similar in ap- 
pearance to the Crossfire playing screen. Each screen includes sixteen 
rooms. The corridors are patrolled by splendidly animated robotlike 
guards who travel in a random search pattern until they see you. When 
one of them does, they all attempt to catch you and blow up in your face. 
You can duck into a room to escape them and they'll soon forget you 
were there. 

Surprisingly enough, your goal is not to kill these robots. In fact, you 
have no way to kill them. Points are acquired by surviving long enough 
to move on to the next screen. It's important not to be killed, but it's also 
important not to be seen: Each time you're spotted, the number of points 
you'll get for completing that level is cut in half. You can also pick up 
bonus points by getting objects hidden in the rooms, but these are periph- 
eral to the main theme. 

The object of the game is really more adventuresome than that. There 
are 120 screens in the game, existing in a buUding that has five floors, 
each floor being composed of a six-by-four array of playing screens. 
Each screen has a flashing object that you must retrieve before you can 
proceed to the next screen on that floor. When you get the object, you are 
offered a way out. The trick is you are offered a way out in one direction 
only! Some screens also have an elevator to the floor above or below, so 
there are at most two exits from any screen. You'll find, as you move

from screen to screen, that you have to make a map if you expect to get 
any place but lost. 

There is good reason to know where you are. On nine of the one hun- 
dred twenty screens there is a contact waiting to give you a clue. The 
nine clues are in code. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to 
get all the clues and crack the code. This isn't a trivial task. First of all, 
you will be given the clues in the same order each time you play the game 
no matter which contacts you go to. This means that you have to get all 
nine clues in the same game; you can't get five clues, get killed, and then 
play again to get the other four. Also, the clues come in the form of col- 
ors and musical tones. It's not a simple cipher to crack. 

If you succeed in translating the message and are the first in your 
state, Canadian province, or foreign country to do so, Penguin will 
award you a $100 gift certificate. In Penguin money (which, as we 
know, is a deflated form of U.S. currency) that's five games. 

As a nice bonus, if you have a Mockingboard, The Spy Strikes Back 
puts it to good use. The security robots are kind enough to tell you when 
they see you, the explosions are more convincing, and the coded tones 
are more musical. Penguin's Spy games seem to follow the Bond films' 
pattern of becoming progressively more impressive technically. Which 
raises an interesting question: Will there be more Spy games? If this one 
is a success. Penguin may decide to take a lesson from Sean Connery: 
Never say never again! DD

Zoo Master. By Kevin Ryan. Several years ago, a young company of 
highly principled people with a strong aversion to violence put out a 
game with the theme of catching stray animals from the zoo. With a 
dozen screens (or so it seemed) of no-punches-held philosophy to wade 
through before playing, the game didn't rise high on the charts. The 
company soon learned to save the speeches for those who asked for them 
and went on to become the successful Avant-Garde. Somewhere along 
the way, their aversion to violence also fell by the wayside — not a great 
loss either, since most computer games that purport to be violent do not 
play as violence but as tests of skill. 

Now another young company has released a game about catching 
stray animals from the zoo. True to its time, this game is more 
sophisticated than the infant Avant-Garde 's game was. But, like many 
nonviolent games. Zoo Master plays as if it were as violent as any other 
game. The player must catch the birds (oddly none of which can fly), but 
dangerous animals must be trapped or tranquilized. 

And how do you tranquilize a dangerous animal? You shoot it, of 
course, but only with a tranquilizer gun. But fear not that it might seem 
just like killing the beasts: Each fallen giraffe or tiger emits a line of 
peaceful little zzzzzs as it lies there. Comforting. And then there's the 
player, represented by a wee head in a little Jeep: Are the animals as kind 
to the player? Mais, non, zees ees realite — ze animals, zey do not know 
how to tranquilize — zey bite and maul and eat up, yum. Jeep and all. 

Odd about reality, how the need for its presence or absence suits itself 
to the desired ends. Among the dangerous zoo animals are yeti that, 
because of their great size, can scale walls even birds can't fly over. 
That's a coup for any zoo. But the relentlessly pursuing yeti jjep up the 
game, adding a frustration factor that actually reminds the player that his 
gun is a mere tranquilizer. On the yeti, patient is the person who doesn't 
wish it were a Magnum .44. 

Well, the game needed the boost. But, once the decision to abandon 
reality is made, why stop? Thus another compromise: From time to time 
each animal wiggles itself into a different animal. And, occasionally, the 
screen shimmers for a second into negative and then a lot of animals 
metamorphose into— yuk— yeti. 

From the standpoint of playability, the tradeoffs work. Without them, 
the gaip^ might suffer. With them, it's kind of fun. Also enhancing 
playability is the presence of a larger goal — artificial and just for fim; it 
also explains just how all the animals got loose. Blame it on (fanfare) the 
mad scientist. You know him. By the time the game begins, he's on the 
fifth level of the zoo, still happily uncaging critters at a fast pace. Captur- 
ing him can more than double an ordinary score. That's the main goal 
and a good one to go after directly when you're new to the game. 

Later on, as you figure out strategies to avoid becoming a meal for a 
grizzly or a floormat for an elephant, you can go for high scores. A 
thoroughly nonviolent, challenging, and delightful means to a large 



bonus is to capture at least one each of the five kinds of birds, all on one 
level. Some situations seem impossible on first play, such as escaping at 
all when several animals become yeti and they're coming at you from 
different directions — and there are still your run-of-the-mill 
rhinoceroses, lethal snakes, and vicious "flying ducks" (other than 
these, are there ducks that don't fly?) to contend with. After a while, and 
after a few miraculous escapes, you realize that there might be a way to 
play your way out of these situations. The game has a lot more depth than 
meets the glancing eye. 

Zoo Master is not very speedy, although quick thinking and fast ac- 
tion are called for. Youngsters and adults are apt to play it for different 
values. It's easy to imagine small kids totally absorbed by the game right 
away. Oldsters, say fifteen and up, may need to let it grow on them. But 
things that grow on you often last; Zoo Master shows promise of continu- 
ing to fascinate and frustrate its aficionados for a long time. 

And remember, when the traps explode, when the gun goes off, when 
the leopard devours you, this is nonviolent.

Lancaster. By Will Harvey. Lately, it seems that the initial sales success 
of entertainment software has been based upon consumer response to 
slick packaging. Boxes are in vogue, while flat, cardboard-backed plas- 
tic envelopes seem passe. Marketing mavens have lost jobs (and 
sometimes vital organs) due to miscalculations concerning what attracts a 
buyer to a product. For example, the incorrect use of package colors or 
a lackluster title can spell doom for an otherwise exciting game. And 
documentation that reads as though it were penned by a Ukrainian bear 
keeper will often ring the game's death knell. 

To get along with Lancaster, you must overcome these prejudices. 
Ignore Lancaster's tide, put aside the dull packaging, and bum the docu- 
mentation after the first reading. Silicon VaUey Systems's second entry 
into the arcade game market revolves around exciting play and fine 
graphics. Surprise! 

The scenario is of the overused threat-to-Earth variety, but the 
game's execution is excellent. Alien creatures resembling bugs try to 
conquer your planet by blowing bubbles — colorful bubbles. Bouncy bub- 
bles that i'ebound all around the playing area— deadly bubbles! For inside 
each fragile blister reside three larvae that grow into adult insects. As 
larvae, the insects are indestructible and should be avoided at all costs, 
but once they reach adulthood they should be -destroy ed— quickly. If al- 
lowed to survive, these renegades from a Roach Motel create more 
larvae-infested bubbles that in turn produce more menacing insects. 
Therefore, the player's odds for a long and fruitful life shrink alarmingly 
with each colorful cocoon. 

The bubbles sport a spectrum of color. A bar of colors also runs 
along the bottom of the screen. Should a bubble and bar of identical color 
meet, the bar portion disappears from view and additional points are add- 
ed to the player's score. Should the player erase all of the bars, an extra 
ship and bonus points are awarded. 

Players start out with five ships that can move vertically and horizon- 
tally and can be controlled by either a keyboard or joystick. Button 1 ac- 
tivates the pincers along a ship's base that are used to lift a bubble to a 
new location. This is done to drop the bubble on a bar of the same color, 
move a potentially lethal object out of harm's way, or seize a bouncing 
bubble. Should the last prove successful, the player gamers additional 
points. 

Allow a bug, bubble, or larva to strike and one ship is destroyed. 
Should matters go poorly, you can use a smart bomb to cause everything 
but larvae to evaporate immediately. Unfortunately, only three such de- 
terrents are available for each game. The bottom of the screen reveals the 
current score and number of ships remaining to the player. 

When the player has lost all five ships, the high-score screen appears. 
Both high scores for the day and scores to date are shown. For some rea- 
son, the author found it necessary to instigate a slow signature scrawl on- 
screen, which can be aggravating if a player wants to retum to the game 
immediately. To speed things up, strike any key and begin a new game. 

Addictive play, sophisticated movement, bright color, and arcadelike 
quality all prove that, in Lancaster's case, the old cliche holds true— you 
really can't tell a book by its cover. NL

fOllOW THE nOATING POINL

stop the Treadmill, I Want To Get On 



Have you ever had the feeling that you're running and run- 
ning and just not getting anyplace? Usually it's a feeling related to, and 
sometimes a necessary part of, getting work done. We use different 
terms to describe this experience — we call it the rat race, the treadmill, 
going around in circles, and so on. Well, mirabile dictu, the computer is 
capable of just such behavior, and it doesn't even mind. (It doesn't have 
a mind to, you could say.) By programming the computer properly, we 
can have most of the advantages the treadmill offers — and there must be 
a desirable end product in there someplace or we wouldn't have put up 
with this situation all these centuries — without having to run it ourselves. 

Go with the Flow. Last month we summarized some of the things a 
computer can do for us. We said that it's good at any information work 
that is repetitive, time-consuming, dull, or all of the above. A key word 
is repetitive. One of the agents— indeed, you could say an unquestioning 
workhorse of all this repetitive activity you're going to instruct your Ap- 
ple to perform — is the goto command. 

Goto is one way to get around in an Applesoft program. Remember 
when we talked about flow charts? Last month's chart had a number of 
loops in it: places where the arrows and lines indicated that the computer 
should return to a previously executed part of the program. Those lines 
indicated ^ow of control. You see, the Apple can execute only one com- 
mand at a time. Normally, when it is finished with one command, it 
moves on to the next one in sequence. In some cases, however, a com- 
mand tells the computer to continue its operations elsewhere. The 
simplest of the several commands that do this is goto. By the way, that 
isn't a typo. In English, it would be go to, but in Applesoft it's treated as 
one word. 

All we lack is a way to tell the computer where to goto (or maybe, 
where to goto to?). For this we use line numbers. You'll recall from last 
time that line numbers tell the computer where to put a line in the pro- 
gram when you're writing it. Another major purpose that line numbers 
serve is to index the lines so that you have a way to tell the computer to 
loop back to a specific one. 

Let's put this new knowledge to use. Fire up your Apple the way we 
talked about last time, and when you have the Applesoft prompt (]) and 
the blinking cursor, type new to clear the Apple's memory of any 
previous programs. (You may wonder how a program might have gotten 
there if you just turned the computer on. The assumption is that you 
booted up with your System Master or another disk. Most disks that 
operate under DOS have a program on them that runs automatically 
when you boot the disk. This is called a hello program.) 

A Scholarly Example. So, on to a quick program of our own. One of 
the repetitive tasks that most schoolkids are called upon to perform at 
some time before reaching junior high is the writing of something one 
hundred times, or until their arms fall off. Teachers in the future are go- 
ing to have to think of something more imaginative, because pretty soon 
some smart kid is going to write this program, run it, and have the output 
printed in triplicate: one copy for the teacher, one for the parents, and 



one for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The pro- 
gram looks like this: 
10 HOME 

20 PRINT "I will not shoot spitballs in class again." 
30 GOTO 20 

Go ahead and type it in, then run it. Notice that the commands home, 
print, and goto are all in capital letters, while the message in quotes is in 
mixed upper and lower case. If you have an Apple II or n Plus, you'll 
have to type the whole thing in capitals, because your computer has no 
provision for input or display in lower case (barring certain possible 
hardware modifications that we won't go into here). 

If you have a lie, you can use both upper and lower case, but in a few 
ways you have more responsibilities than those who lack that flexibility. 
First of all, Applesoft and DOS commands have to be entered in upper 
case, so if you want to switch to lower case for material to be printed, as 
shown in this program, you have to remember to set the caps-lock key 
again when you've typed the stuff within the quotes. Another thing to 
remember is that, if you want to write programs that will run on Apples 
other than your own, you have to consider that some of those machines 
won't be able to display lower case. If this bothers you at all, set the 
caps-lock key and leave it on for now. 

If you ran that program when you were asked to, you may have no- 
ticed while you were reading the last paragraph that your Apple was 
busily doing penance for your sins. In fact, it probably finished writing 
the sentence a hundred times quite a while ago, but it's continuing tire- 
lessly nevertheless. What a workhorse! The Apple is in what's called an 
infinite loop — that is, a situation in which it will just keep on doing the 
same thing over and over again. Let's tell it to stop and then look at how 
it got into this ridiculous situation. 

Stop the Presses! Normally, you can't give commands to the Apple 
while it's busy doing something else. There's one command, however, 
that Applesoft will pay attention to at any time. Hold down the control 
key and hit the C key. This is called "hitting control-C," and it means, 
"Stop!" This isn't the kind of command you'd put into a program (even 
if you could), but it comes in handy when you're debugging a program. 

It should be fairly obvious how we got stuck in an infinite loop. Line 
30 told the computer to go back to a previous command. When the com- 
puter returned to line 30, it did the same thing again. And it kept on do- 
ing it until we forced it to stop with control-C. Figure 1 shows a flow 
chart of this program, which should clarify what happened. 

What we need is a way of counting how many times our message has 
been written and stopping when we've printed it one hundred times. We 
have just the command; it's called if-then. Before we can use if-then, 
however, we have to know something about variables. Variables are 
another kind of word in the Applesoft sentence. They are used to store 
data to be used in a program later on. There are three types of variables: 
real, integer, and string. The first two are different types of numeric 
variables— variables for holding numbers. The last one is for holding

alphanumeric data: names, dates, and so on. We'll look only at real 
variables this time. 

Real numbers differ from integers in that integers have no decimal 
places while reals may or may not have decimal places. So 2, -9, and 
103 are both reals and integers, while 3.14159, 98.6, and —0.003 are on- 
ly reals. Because the decimal point can fall anyplace within a real 
number, reals are also called floating point numbers. Applesoft is also 
called Floating Point Basic (hence the name of this column) to 
distinguish it from the older Integer Basic. (Floating Point Basic may 
seem a bit long-winded, but Real Basic was probably rejected as too 
pretentious.) 

Anyway, real variables are those that can hold real numbers. Ap- 
plesoft interprets as a variable anything in a program that begins with a 
letter, consists solely of letters and numbers, isn't contained in quotes, 
and doesn't contain any command names. Applesoft sets up space for 
variables while it's running a program. If a variable is in a place in a 
statement where a variable or some such expression is expected, so much 
the better. Applesoft will deal with the variable as called for and continue 
to run the program. If something isn't in a syntactically correct place for 
a variable, Applesoft will still think it's a variable when you type the line 
in but will throw the case out of court when you try to run the program. 

A Safe Deposit Box To Keep Your Values In. What does all this 
mean to you? If you have a number you want to keep track of for later 
use in the program, make up a variable name and tell the computer that 
the variable equals that number. You may tell it to change the value of 
the variable later on, which is why we call them variables. 

For now, let's stick to one-letter variable names to avoid confusion 
(meaning to avoid going into a lot of rules this early in the game). What 
our program needs is a counting variable. Let's start out by telling the 
program that this variable exists and what it is worth. Add this line: 

5 LET X = 1 

Not worth much, is it? Worry not, it will come to be worth much 
more. Now throw in this line: 



25 LET X 



1 



Lines 5 and 25 assign values to X. In the first case, the value 1 is 
given to the variable. This means that whenever we say X in the future, 
we mean 1 , unless we are telling the computer to let X equal something 
else. In line 25, for instance, the expression X + 1 is evaluated to mean 
1 -I- 1 , or 2, so the variable X comes to mean 2. Since a variable can hold 
only one value at a time, X now forgets that it ever meant 1 and is 
prepared to go through life meaning 2, as if that were all it had 
ever meant. 

Something like an Identity Crisis. However, since line 30 still sends 
us back to line 20, and line 25 follows line 20 sure as a street sweeper 
follows a ticker-tape parade, the next time through the loop, X will be 
told to equal X -(- 1, or 2 + 1, and it will suddenly think of itself as 3.

(By the way, the word let in lines 5 and 25 is optional, but it serves to 
remind die-hard algebra students not to use the phrase X = X + 1 to 
prove that 1 = 0. Once you've fully accepted that 1 = 1 and 0 = 0, you 
can omit the word let in such statements.) 

So we can see the variable doing its thing, let's change line 20 (the 
easiest way to do this is to retype the line): 

20 PRINT X; " I will not shoot spitballs in class again." 

This way, the counting number— the value of X— will be printed 
before each repetition of the sentence. The semicolon separating the X 
from the sentence in quotes tells Applesoft not to put any spaces between 
the value of X and the first character in quotes. However, we also put 
two leading spaces between the opening quote and the start of the 
sentence so that the number will not run into the sentence. Run the 
program. 

You'll see that each time the sentence is printed, it is preceded by a 
number. But we still have an infinite loop, because we aren't acting on 
that number. Anybody remember if-then? Good. If-then works like this: 
The command if is followed by a condition like one of these: 

X = 5 

X > = Y - 3 

(X 4- 5) * 2 <>Z / 100 

These conditions mean X equals 5, X is greater than or equal to the dif- 
ference Y - 3, and the sum X -I- 5 multiplied by 2 is not equal to Z di- 
vided by 100 respectively. In an if-then statement, the condition is fol- 
lowed immediately by the word then and any Applesoft command. If the 
condition is true when the statement is executed, the command following 
then will be executed. If not, Applesoft looks for the next line of the pro- 
gram and executes it. The line that should serve our purposes is: 

30 IF X < 100 THEN GOTO 20 

Let's add a line at the end for the flow of control to fall back on when 



the condition is false. This isn't entirely necessary, as the program will 
just stop, which is what we want, even if we add nothing to the end. But 
let's do it anyway for good form. 

40 END 

The end command tells the program to stop, even if end isn't located 
at the physical end of the listing. 

If you run the program now, you'll see that, unfortunately, it prints 
out the sentence only ninety-nine times. Figure 2 is the flow chart of the 
newly modified program. Trace through the chart or list the program and 
trace through the listing (that is, try to run the program in your mind). 
You'll see that the value of X was increased to 100 and then the check 
was made to see if X was less than 100. Since 100 is not less than 100, 
the test in line 30 failed, Applesoft advanced to line 40, end, so the pro- 
gram stopped. There are a couple of ways to make the program work as 
desired. The easiest one (involving the fewest changes to the program) is 
to change line 30 to: 

30 IF X <= 100 THEN GOTO 20 

This works because 100 is less than or equal to 100. Think about it. 
You should be able to come up with at least one other way to solve the 
problem. Hint: You can put the print statement after the line that in- , 
crements the value of X. And don't jump up and say you know the 
answer until you've tried it and know it works, because the answer con- 
tains other traps to fall into. Solving puzzles like this is what program- 
ming is all about. 

Downshift into Second. It isn't easy to cover all the facts and stay on 
one coherent course of instruction at the same time: Too many digres- 
sions can make the larger picture harder to see. This is a good time to 
look at some details that we've glossed over so far. The first of these 
shall be, arbitrarily, arithmetic expressions. 

An expression is a series of numbers, variables, arithmetic operators, 
and functions put together in such a way that the computer can evaluate

them— that is, simplify them— to a single value. So far, we've seen these 
expressions in let statements and in if-then statements. Of the commands 
we've looked at so far, expressions can also appear in print statements. 

We'll continue to ignore functions for the time being, and you should 
already have a sufficient familiarity with numbers and variables. The 
operators that can appear in arithmetic expressions are the symbols + , 
-, *, /, and A . The first two are self-explanatory. The asterisk (*) in- 
dicates multiplication, the slash (/) means division, and the caret (a) 
represents exponents. In addition (also in subtraction, multiplication, and 
so on, if you'll pardon the pun), parentheses can be used to tell the com- 
puter which operations to perform first in evaluating an expression. 
Figure 3 shows each of the five Basic operators used in expressions; the 
way they would appear in standard mathematical notation is displayed 
alongside them. 

Formally speaking, a let statement has a single variable on the left of 
the equal sign and an expression on the right. The expression can be as 
simple as a single variable or number, or it can be extremely com- 
plicated. When the expression is evaluated, the resulting value replaces 
the previous value of the variable that appears on the left of the equal 
sign. Remember that that variable can be used as part of the expression 
on the right, which is useful for incrementing loops, as we have seen. 




190 



OCTOBER 1983 



An if-then statement may superficially resemble a let statement, but 
there are two other relational operators— symbols indicating a com- 
parison of values— in addition to the equal sign; they are > and < , mean- 
ing greater than and less than. As shown in the latest version of line 30, 
relational operators can be used singly or in pairs. When a pair is used, it 
acts as a single operator, but it means either one or the other is true. In 
other words, > = or = < means "is greater than or equal to." Inequality 
is expressed by <> or >< , meaning literally, "is greater than or less 
than." An if-then statement may have simple or complex expressions on 
both sides of the operator. 

The print statement is a little more complex than we presented here. 
We know it consists of the word print and something to be printed. The 
material to be printed can be any number of numbers, variables, expres- 
sions, and strings, limited only by Applesoft's 239-character line input 
length. {String, by the way, is the term for words, sentences, and other 
sets of characters appearing between quotes.) A print statement followed 
by nothing causes a blank line to be printed. 

If you use semicolons to separate the elements of a print statement, 
each element will print where the last one left off. This is true even if you

end a print statement with a semicolon. The first character printed by the 
next print statement will appear immediately after the last character 
printed. 

If you use a comma instead of a semicolon, the next element printed 
will line up in predefined columns. These columns are kind of like tab 
settings on a typewriter, except that the programmer has no control over 
them. Applesoft uses columns 1, 17, and 33 as its tab settings. There are 
more flexible ways to assign columns to tabular printed data, so the com- 
ma is used in print statements only when three columns is sufficient. 

Guess Your Wait. Next month we're going to create a simple ran- 
dom number guessing game, but there's no reason you shouldn't get a 
head start. Such a game should select a random number, ask for the 
user's guess, say whether the guess is high, low, or correct, and either 
end the game or let the user guess again. Beyond that, you can make your 
program as fancy as you like. You'll need two new commands in addi- 
tion to the ones you already know. The first is input. This command is 
another way of assigning a value to a variable, but instead of assigning 
the value from within the program, input asks the user for the value. Use 
the following line to solicit the user's guess: 

100 INPUT "What is your guess? ";G 

The string between the quotes acts as the prompt, and G is the variable 
Applesoft will put the answer in. 

Now the random number to be guessed is generated using two ftinc- 
tions, like so: 

110 LET R = INT( RND( 1) * 10) -i- 1 

This line generates a random integer between one and ten and stores it in 
the variable R. We'll explain what INT and RND mean as well as how 
the whole thing works next time.

VENTURES WITH 
VISICALC 

BV JOE SHELTOn 



Last month we completed a template on the cost of borrowing money. 
As we mentioned then, VisiCalc Advanced Version users may want to 
modify that template to take advantage of some Advanced Version 
features. This month we'll undertake those modifications. Of course, as 
regular readers know, doing this will involve solving a problem. No free 
lunches here. If you don't have the finished template from last month, 
don't despair; you can still follow along with what we're going to 
do here. 

Those of you who are using the regular VisiCalc will have another 
opportunity later on in the column. It's no free lunch either; once again, 
there's a problem to solve. Stay tuned. 

@LABEL. The template we constructed last month began with 
September and continued through the following August (figure 1 shows 
the skeleton of that template; the formulas are not important for this dis- 
cussion). If the loan you'd like to chart begins in a different month, you 
have a couple of options. One is to replace month titles with numbers so 
that you'll only have to deal in numbers when working with months. 
Meanwhile, Advanced Version provides a way of having the correct 
month's titles displayed, no matter which month you start in. But, as you 
might have guessed, setting things up this way takes a little doing. 
Let's see. . . . 

By now you realize that we're going to use the Advanced Version 
function ©LABEL. ©LABEL is a sneaky way to turn text into 
something VisiCalc thinks is a value. And that means you can now have 
VisiCalc's other functions display text as well as values. 

Let's look at an example of how this capability works. Choose a cell 
outside the template area, say XI , and enter your name. In the cell below 
the first one (X2), enter ©LABEL(Xl) and press return. 

Your name should now be displayed in the second cell. Next, enter 
some other text in XI and press return. Notice that whatever text you 
entered is now displayed in X2. In other words, ©LABEL can be used to 
display names, dates, or other information that must appear in different 
parts of a template. 

©LABEL can also be used to display information related to a com- 
putation. If you were doing a stock portfolio analysis, for example, you 
could set up the ©LABEL function to display the label SELL when some 
ratio of a company falls below a certain point. Instead of having to pick 
out undesirable ratios, you'd be letting VisiCalc "talk" to you. All you'd 
have to do to make this happen would be to specify that the result to be 



displayed from an ©IF logic function be the ©LABEL function instead 
of a value. 

Do you see now how we might use ©LABEL to solve our problem? 
Enter labels for the months January through December in cells B35 
through B46, as shown in figure 2. 

The area shown in figure 2 is the text table from which our labels will 
be displayed. Next we want to replace the month titles (September 
through August) in B15 through B26 with formulas that will result in the 
display of the appropriate months. One way to go would be to enter 
©LABEL(B43) (September) in B15 and replicate it throughout column 
B. That would result in the correct month for our loan being displayed, 
but it wouldn't tell us how to choose the beginning month of a loan and 
have it show up correctly. 

Suppose we were to place an entry field for the beginning month in 
DIO, as shown in figure 3. 

Before reading any further why not see if you can determine how 
to proceed? 

All we need to do is to have the value in DIO select the first month 
from the table. The ©CHOOSE function is an easy way of ac- 
complishing that. The formula in B15 would read: 

@LABEL(@CHOOSE(D10,B35...B46)). 

Try it and notice the results. The ©CHOOSE function uses the 1 in DIO 
and counts that number of entries down the month table; it should display 
January. 

The next month would require that the value read in DIO be in- 
cremented from 1 to 2 so that the second month will be displayed. The 
formula in B16 would read: 

@LABEL(@CH00SE(D1 0 + 1 , B35. . . B46)) 

The third month would require incrementing 1 to 3. The formula in 
B17 would read: 

@LABEL(@CH00SE(D1 0 + 2,B35...B46)) 

and so on. 

You can see how undesirable having to enter twelve, much less forty- 
eight, more formulas would be. You couldn't simply replicate a formula; 
you'd have to enter a new value manually in each cell. 

See if you can think of a strategy for solving this problem (there's at

least one) before we look at an alternative. 

You can use the ©LOOKUP function to achieve the same results as 
you get by using ©CHOOSE. The ©LOOKUP function requires a little 
help, however. First, it takes the value in DIO and compares it against a 
table of incremental values. When it finds the value that matches the 
lookup value (for example, the value in DIO), ©LOOKUP displays that 
value in the column to tiie right of the lookup column (or, in the case of 
a row orientation, in the row below the looloip row). So we must enter 
appropriate values to the left of the months. Beginning in A35, enter 1 
through 12 in column A. Your template should now resemble figure 4. 

Using ©LOOKUP, the formula in B15 would read: 

@LABEL(@LOOKUP(D10,A35..,A46)). 

The next month's formula would again have to increment the DIO 
value, so ©LOOKUP doesn't alleviate the problem of having to in- 
crement a value for each month after the first one. Is there a better 
approach? 

There are a number of ways to solve our problem. The most obvious 
is to have a value in the same row as the formula that increments by 1 in 
each succeeding row. Then we enter a cell reference instead of a value. 

This same solution can be used to solve the ©CHOOSE problem we 
were just talking about. For example, cell A16 would contain a 1. If we 
decided to continue using the ©LOOKUP function, the formula in B16 
would be: 

@LABEL(@L00KUP(D1 0 + A1 6,A35...A46)). 

Cell A 17 would contain + A16 + 1 and the formula in B17 would be: 

@LABEL(@L00KUP(D1 0 + A1 7,A35. ..A46)). 

You could replicate the formulas into A17 and B17 down the column, us- 
ing relative and no change (relative, no change, no change), and see the 
appropriate results. 

Now change the value in DIO to 5 (May) and see what happens. The 
results aren't what you might expect, but they're exacdy what you should 
expect. Whether you use ©LOOKUP or ©CHOOSE, the month table 
we entered doesn't contain enough months. When ©CHOOSE is used, 
the function will display NA once the value is greater than 12 (the end

of the month table). ©LOOKUP, on the other hand, will continue to 
return the last value in the table— in this case, December. 
How might we resolve this problem? 

To begin with, we know that the problem lies in the fact that we have 
values that will continue to increment (months 21 , 22, 23, and so on) and 
a table that will end with the twelfth entry. One obvious solution would 
be to enlarge the table. Thus, if you were dealing with a forty-eight- 
month loan, you'd need a table with sixty entries. Why sixty? Because 
you'd have to be able to start in any month, from January (month 1 ) to 
December (month 12), and continue for forty -eight more months. The 
worst case, then, would be 12 -I- 48 = 60 — that's a lot of entries. There 
must be a better way. (There is.) 

Another option would be to take the lookup values beside the months 
and change them to the correct values. That, too, would require more 
than twelve months. Or, you might factor the increment values in the for- 
mulas, or perhaps the formulas themselves. Say what? Well, you could 
look at each formula and decide whether the result it obtained is greater 
than twelve. If it isn't, return the value; if it is, subtract twelve from it. 
Then the value will be appropriate for the next year. (See any flaws in 
this logic? Think about the third year. If you subtract 12 from month 25, 
you get 13. We're back to the beginning; all values that follow are 
incorrect.) 

So now we're in a quandary. We don't seem any closer to a solution 
than we were before. So, the next step is to start with what we know. 

First, we know that when we just use ©LABEL, any month values 
beyond 12 require a longer lookup or choose table. 

Second, we know that in order to use the twelve-month table we must 
have each formula return a value between 1 and 12. 

Third, we know that the month values could go far beyond 12. 

Fourth, we know that subtracting 12 from the month values over 12 
works only for the year that follows and not for the years after that. 

Thus, it seems that any value less than or equal to 12 is okay and that 
any value greater than 12 must be reduced to 12 or less. 

©IF would certainly seem to be a logical solution. It gives us the op- 
portunity to make selections based on values. But does it work? Yes, you

can probably make it work, but for each of the twelve months, you'll 
need another @IF function. A simple example for three years would be: 

@IF(D10<13,D10,@IF(D10<24,D10-12,D10-24) 

For a fourth year you'd need another @IF function. The whole business 
could get cumbersome. 

So we're back to having to reduce a value to 12, but without using the 
@IF function. If you're an enterprising individual, you might want to 
consider some other logic functions. But there's a simpler solution. 
Dividing the month value by 12 tells us how many years we have. If we 
take the integer value of that result and multiply it by 12, we'll know how 
many months to subtract in order to leave the correct number of remain- 
ing months. Subtracting should give us our answer. So, for example, if 
we were talking about thirty-nine months, we'd divide 39 by 12 for an 
answer of 3.25. The integer value of this figure is 3; 3 multiplied by 12 
is equal to 36. Subtract 36 from 39 and you get 3. March is the correct 
answer. (A solution!) 

Well, not quite. Suppose we have thirty-six months. Dividing 36 by 
12 gives us 3.0, the integer value of which is 3; 3 times 12 is 36, and 36 
minus 36 is 0. The month value would be 0 for every December. We 
could go back to our table and change it to see if making December 
month 0 would work. But we may have a bit of a clue in what we just did. 

The process we went through to arrive at the value 3 is something 
that VisiCalc provides a function for. The function is @MOD, called 
modulo. It is written: 

@M0D(v1,v2), 

Stated simply, @MOD returns the remainder after one value (vl) has 
been divided by another (v2). Using @MOD (36,12) returns 0, just as 
the solution we just arrived at did. Rather than changing the table to 
make 0 equal December, let's change the formula. (Finally, @IF may 
provide our answer.) 

To state the problem in English: If the mod of our value is greater 
than 0, use the mod of that value; otherwise, use 12. That could be 
written: 



@IF(@MOD(A15,12)>0,@MOD(A15,12),12) 

Another way to write it would be: 

@IF(@MOD(A15,12) = 0,12,@MOD(A15,12) 

Both formulas return the same answer. If we use 39 as our value, March 
will be displayed; if we use 36, December will be displayed. 

The ©LABEL function can be quite useful, saving you time and pro- 
viding a definitive analysis tool— a method of analysis that "tells" you 
an answer. You'll soon find that the more you use the ©LABEL func- 
tion, the more you'll want to use it. 

Pick a Number — Any Number. Here's another opportunity— a 
problem any VisiCalc user can solve. You might encounter this kind of 
problem in many different types of templates, and it doesn't require Ad- 
vanced Version. 

Suppose we're running a tournament for a local golf club. In order to 
qualify for the tournament, the average of the entrant's last six rounds 
must be under 100 and all rounds must have been played within the last 
month. We want VisiCalc to calculate automatically the average of the 
last six rounds for each player. Sounds simple, so far. 

Let's make it even easier and assume that all members of the club 
have played at least the minimum number of times during the month. We 
maintain records of all rounds played, with the latest date displayed at the 
left of the template. To keep our solution simple, we'll look at only two 
players' scores. Figure 5 shows Fred's and Marge's records. 

Our task is to average each player's last six scores. For simplicity's 
sake, we'll use only the information shown in the figure- eleven days' 
scores— rather than a whole month's worth of scores. Our solution will 
apply to the whole month's scores too. 

So what's our task? To average the first six scores across each row, 
starting in column B. We'll enter Fred's and Marge's averages in B8 
and B9. 

The obvious way to proceed is to average each player's row. But 
think about that for a minute. What we're trying to obtain is averages of 
their last six scores. Averaging the rows would give us a valid average of

their scores for the entire month but wouldn't separate out the last six 
scores to give us the averages we seek. 

Another solution would be to enter @AVERAGE(C4...J4) starting 
with Fred. That would give us Fred's average score for the last six times 
he played. Replicating that into B9 won't give us Marge's average 
because her first score is in B5 and her sixth score is in L5. The correct 
formula for Marge's average is @AVERAGE(B5. . .L5). Suppose 
another player, Jim, played every day during the first six days of 
the month. The formula for averaging Jim's scores would be 
@AVERAGE(Z6...AE6). Notice that each average requires a differ- 
ent range. 

Now imagine that there are thirty club members who might qualify 
for this tournament and that we are going to have another tournament at 
the end of every month. In order to determine which players qualify, we 
would have to go through each player's scores each month and select the 
appropriate range to include the last scores. That could be a time- 
consuming process. There must be a better way. 

The ©CHOOSE function might be the solution. According to the 
reference card, ©CHOOSE "returns the vth element in a list." Asking 
for a sum of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth scores in each 
row and then dividing by six should allow us to average just the first six 
rounds. 

The function is written ©CHOOSE(v,list). If we wanted the second 
value in a list, we'd enter ©CHOOSE(2,A50. .. A75). Obtaining the third 
value would simply require substituting 3 for 2. Remember that a list 



can be a combination of values, cell references, and ranges sepa- 
rated by commas. The expression A12. ..A45, 12,34. ..L4,F35 is a 
valid list. 

The formula for Fred's average would be; 

(@CH00SE(1 ,B4...L4) + @CHOOSE(2,B4...L4) + 
@CH00SE(3 , B4 . . . L4) + @CH 00SE(4 , B4 . . . L4) -I- 
@CH00SE(5, B4. . . L4) + @CH00SE(6, B4, . . L4)/6) 

Does it work? Well it does give us an average, but the average looks 
suspiciously low, approximately two-thirds what we'd have expected. 
Players would love to have averages like that! In actuality, our formula 
averaged only four of the scores. Why? The answer can be found in the 
wording of the description in the reference card. ©CHOOSE(v,list) 
"returns the vth element in the list." It does not discriminate between 
cells containing actual values and cells that are blank. ©CHOOSE con- 
siders a blank to be an element containing a value equal to zero. The first 
and third elements in Fred's list of scores are blanks, and the second, 
fourth, fifth, and sixth elements are values. Hence the average we ob- 
tained is the sum of four actual scores divided by six. ©CHOOSE isn't 
the answer. 

©LOOKUP is another possibility. According to the reference card, 
©LOOKUP "compares v to the successive values in range, finds the 
largest value less than or equal to v, and returns the corresponding value 
from an adjacent range." As we know from our ©LABEL experience, 
©LOOKUP requires two columns or rows, one containing the values be

ing compared against the lookup value and the other containing the 
values to be returned. ©LOOKUP doesn't seem to buy us anything over 
©CHOOSE, and in addition it requires that we use another row. 

©COUNT is the next function that looks promising. Again from 
the reference card, we know that ©COUNT returns the "number of 
nonblank entries in a list." That sounds interesting. ©CHOOSE as- 
sumes that empty cells are values, but ©COUNT ignores blank entries. 

If we ©COUNT Fred's row we'll know how many times he played 
during the month. We don't really need that information, though. 
Rather, we need to locate the first six entries. If we knew how many cells 
were required to include our six rounds, we could use ©COUNT. But 
we don't, and having to determine the range of the first six scores for 
each player presents the same problem that using ©AVERAGE did. 

But we may be on to something here. We do have a given range for 
each of Fred's scores in row 4. If we were to use 9/30 as the beginning of 
the range and each score as the end of the range, we could count back un- 
til we found six scores. For example, ©COUNT(B4...B4) would return 
a 0 because there is no value in B4, ©COUNT(B4...B5) would return a 
1 because there's a single value in the range B4...B5, and so on. 

Notice what we've done. The range in the first formula is a single 
cell. The range in the second is two cells. Both ranges start with cell B4. 
In other words, each successive cell contains a range that is one cell 
wider than the previous range. Sounds like we are back to a lot of 
work entering formulas. No way! Replicating the formula 
©COUNT(B4...B4) across a row using no change and relative for the 
references will ensure that each cell has a range that increments by one. 

Insert three rows (/IR,/IR,/IR) below Fred's scores and let's try it. 
Enter ©C0UNT(B4. . .B4) in B5. Replicate it through L5 using no 
change and relative references. Your template should look like figure 6. 

Notice that each time a new score enters the range, ©COUNT 
displays the correct number of scores in the range up until that point. It 
tells us that our sixth score is in column J. So now we have our first solid 
information. We've determined how to find the first six scores. 

Now what? Before reading on, see if you can determine how to use 
this information to solve the rest of our problem. 

The first thing we need to know is whether the value displayed in row 
5 is less than, equal to, or greater than the required six scores. A com- 
parison using one of the logical operators will resolve that. What we're 
really interested in is whether the value is less than or equal to six. If the 
value is score number seven, we don't care. The comparison -l-B5<=6 
entered in B6 will return TRUE; the value in B5 (0) is indeed less than 
six. Replicate the formula in B6 across row 6 and through L6, using 
relative reference. By the time you reach J6, you've found that the value 
in J5 is equal to six. We have located the end of our range. 

K5 also shows that the value is equal to six. But there's no score in 
K4. Remember, ©COUNT is going to return the same value until the 



range expands to include another score. We need to find some way to ig- 
nore any cells beyond the sixth score. 

We could use ©IF. Let's use row 7 to see if we can resolve our prob- 
lem. If we can display only the first six scores, we have our solution. 

The ©IF function is written ©IF(l,vl,v2). Our logical comparison 
in row 6 is 1. If the logical comparison is TRUE, vl is returned; if the 
comparison is FALSE, v2 is returned. If we use the relative cell 
reference in row 4 as vl, it will return a score only if the logical com- 
parison (1) is true and there is a value in the appropriate cell. If there is 
a 0, as in K4, vl returns 0 and can't affect our average. If the logical 
comparison is false, v2 will be returned. 

If, as in the case of cell K4, the logical comparison is TRUE, only a 
0 will be returned. If there were a value in K4, the logical comparison 
would display FALSE because K4 would be the seventh score .^The ©IF 
function wouldn't return the value of that cell. 

What should we use for v2? Since we don't want a value returned, the 
answer, obviously, is 0. The formula in B7 should be ©IF(B6,B4,0). 
Replicate that across row 6 using relative reference and we're almost 
finished. Notice that the only values displayed are the first six scores. 

The method we've just worked out is a very memory-intensive way 
of accomplishing our task. Each golfer requires four rows. There should 
be a way to simplify our template. Notice that the formulas in B5, B6, 
and B7 are directly related. If we started with the formula in B7 and 
substituted the appropriate formula for each cell reference, we could 
combine them. 

The formula in B7 is ©IF(B6,B4,0). Substituting B5 and B6 we get: 

@IF(@C0UNT(B4... B4) < =6,B4,0) 

Enter this formula into B5 and replicate using no change, relative, 
relative. Delete the two remaining rows (6 and 7) and your template 
should look like figure 7. 

Finally, enter Fred's average in B9. Of course we can't do that by 
entering ©AVERAGE(B5...L5). Why not? Because the average func- 
tion would average in the zeros also. So we must do something slightly 
different. Enter ©SUM(B5...L5)/6 into B9 and our average of Fred's 
first six scores will be complete. 

Now you have a method of picking a certain number of values out of 
a range of cells containing both values and blanks. This capability can be 
very useful. For example, it could be used in accounts payable templates 
or stock templates. This method isn't an end in itself; it is just a method 
of helping you solve a problem. If you understand how it works, you can 
even use parts of it to solve other problems. You can also modify it to do 
other things. 

Going back to our original problem, here's one last conundrum to 
solve. Suppose some members of the club haven't played the minimum 
six rounds. How would you ignore their scores?

Cataloging 
Program

FCM, formerly 1st Class Mail, is a lot more than 
just the best mailing list program you can buy. 
Because along with being the most flexible 
and easy-to-use mailing list program there is, 
FCM also handles a number of other tasks 
more easily than any other program of its kind. 

You can use FCM for anything you'd keep on 
file. Like your address book, household bills, 
stamp or com collections, Christmas card list 
(know who sent you a card last year), fishing 
gear inventory or medical records. 

Or how about a list of important dates (FCM 
will let you flag them by name, date and occa- 
sion). Or maybe you'd like to use FCM for a 
guest list for a wedding. FCM will even record 
RSVP's, gifts and thank you notes. 

What's more, FCM is incredibly easy to use. 

Special Features 

FCM lets you create your own mailing label. 
Which means you can make your labels look 
the way you want them to. You can even 
decide to print right on the envelope. Or add a 
special message line like "Merry Christmas" or 
"Attention: Sales Manager." FCM is extremely 
flexible. 

And speaking of flexible, FCM lets you 
search and sort in any of 12 different categories. 
So you can organize mailings any way you 
want: by state, company name, zip code or 
whatever you like. If you're using FCM to 
catalog your home library, you might want to 
sort by title, author or category. It's completely 
up to you. 

But one of the best parts about FCM is being 
able to create your own headings. Because 
that lets you store, file and catalog just about 
anything you'd like to keep tabs on. 

The Form Letter Feature* 

FCM is compatible with many word processing 
programs such as Screenwriter II, Applewriter 
l/ll/lle, Apple Pie, Pie Writer, WordStar/ Mail- 
Merge and Magic Window l/ll. Just a few 
simple commands and you can automatically 
combine your form letters with your mailing list 
for professionally formatted documents. 

Stop by your Continental Software dealer. 
Or call us today to find out all about FCM. 
No matter what you're cataloging, from a 
household inventory for insurance purposes to 
a 25,000 person mailing list, FCM is the best 
program you can buy. 

It's true, you still have to lick the stamp. 

But we're working on it. 

Available for: Apple ll/lle, IBM PC/PC XT, 
Commodore 64, Texas Instruments

IFYOU'RE CONFUSED 
ABOUT BUYING A 

PERSONAL COMPUTER, 
HERE'S SOME HELB 



Computers come in two parts. 

One part is the "hardware;' the 
machinery itself. The other is the 
"software!' which tells a computer 
what to do, the way a driver tells a 
car what to do. 

Without software, a computer 
can't do anything. Aad vice versa. 
You have to buy both. 
Buy the software first 

Since the reason you're buying a 
computer is to get the capability 
the software gives you (remember 
it's the software that tells the com- 
puter what to do) , It makes good 
sense to pick the software first. 

Start by making a list of the 
things you want the computer 
to do. Possibilities include word 
processing, inventory control, 
accounting, graphics, recordkeep- 
ing— you name it, there's probably 
software that does it. 

Next take your list into a com- 
puter store and ask the salesper- 
son to demonstrate software that 
will do the things you want. 

Even though you'll need a com- 
puter for the demonstration, keep 
in mind the computer is just a 
vehicle. The software is the driver. 
Once you've decided on software, 
picking the rest of the computer 
system will be that much easier. 
The simpler the better. 

Some people will tell you that 
software has to be complicated to 
be powerful. Nothing could be fur- 
ther from the truth. 

Good personal software should 
be, as the computer people say, 
"fnendly." Meaning that it helps you 
do what you want to do without get- 
ting in the way. 

Good software keeps the com- 
plications in the computer, where 



they belong. And keeps the capa 
bility at your fingertips, ft's that 
simple. 

Simply see for yoursell 

You can read any number of 
interesting books and mag 
azines about personal 
computers. You can 
ask your friends 
who have 
them. 




Or look 
at all 
the sales 
literature 
you can get 
your hands on. 

But as helpful as 
that can be, there's 
no substitute for a live 
demonstration. 

When you do go shop 
ping, we recommend 
you take a look at 
the PFS* Family 
of Software. 

Designed 
the way we 
think a soft- 
ware family 
should be: 
simple, 

sfraightforward 
and powerful 



Currently there are four software 
packages in the family: PFS:WRITE, 
PFSPILE, PFS:REPORT andPFS: 
GRAPH, with more on the way. 
Here's a little more about each of 
them. 

PFS:WRITE. The simplest way 
to get your message across. 

PFSiWRITE is ideal for people 
who want to make their writing time 
more productive. It displays what 
you write on your computer screen 
so you can make revisions as you 
compose. 

With WRITE , you can correct mis- 
spellings or substitute one portion 
of text for another, with just a few 
keystrokes. 

And when you're through revising, 
WRITE shows you "on-screen"just 
how your document will look 
when it's printed. So there 
are no surprises afterwards. 

WRITE also works with • 
most popular software pro- , 
grams, including the PFS 
Family of Software. 

This feature allows you to add 
names and addresses from mailing 
lists to generate form letters. Or 
combine columns of numbers or 
graphs with your text. 

^PFS: FILE. The simplest 
^^way to get organized. 

^^^FDjE is basically a paper filing 
system without the paper. So 
^^^r you can record, file, retrieve 

and review information in a 
r fraction of the time it takes with a 
conventional filing system. 

With FILE, you arrange your 
information on a "form" you design 
yourself. And when you need to 
track something down, FILE sorts 
through your records electronically. 
It lets you retrieve information in a 
variety of ways so you can be as 
selective as you want. 

PFS:R£PORT. The simplest 
way to sum it all up. 

REPORT is a powerful analysis 
tool that works with FILE . 

REPORT sorts through your files 
and retrieves the information you're 
looking for. Then assembles it all 
into one report, so you can analyze, 
plan and make better-informed 
decisions. 

REPORT is also good at math. It 
quickly sorts through columns of 
numbers and performs calcula- 
tions, so you won't have to.

PFS:GRAPH. 
The simplest 
way to spot trends. 

GRAPH is ideally suited for 
professionals who need charts or 
graphs in a hurry. 

All you do is specify the kind of 
graph or chart you want and enter the 
information, GRAPH does the rest. 

GRAPH transforms columns of 
facts and figures into pie, line and 
bar charts so you can spot trends 
qiiickly and make better-informed 
decisions. 

GRAPH works with PFS: 
WRITE, PFS:FILE,VisiCalc® 
files or data entered directly 
into the computer. And sup- 
ports most popular printers and 
plotters.

Some Very Good 
Reasons to Buy 
an Echo Speech 
Synthesizer. 



We're confident we have the most intelhgible, 
versatile, and economical speech synthesizer 
on the market. Once you hear it, we're sure 
you'll be convinced too. All ECHOs are capable 
of speaking in four different voice modes 
which range from a robotic machine voice to 
natural female speech. (The fixed speech and 
custom modes are optional.) 

It's Easy To Use 

Unlike other speech systems, the ECHOs 
are very simple to use. It only takes a minute 
or two to get the ECHO talking. Any text 
which can be printed to the screen can be 
spoken. If you've written a BASIC program 
you can add speech with simple modifications. 

Software Compatibility 

Not only can you add speech to the programs 
you write yourself, over 25 top educational 
and adventure software manufacturers are 
currently designing programs to be compatible 
with the ECHO ][. Be watching for details. 




Value 

Each ECHO comes ready to use with a speaker 
and tutorial-style manual. The ECHO][, 
priced at $149.95, also comes with a variety 
of demonstration and utility programs . The new 
ECHO GP (General Purpose), priced at $199.95 
is a stand-alone unit with its own on-board 
microprocessor; it will interface with any 
computer through the serial port. All ECHOs 
have a one year warranty. 

Bells And Whistles 

If you want bells, whistles, music and sound 
effects, plus state-of-the-art sprite graphics 
capabilities, the ECHO technology is available 
on Synetix Systems' new Supersprite Board. 

Check It Out 

Most Apple dealers have the ECHO][ available 
for demonstration as part of Street Electronics/ 
Orange Micro's unique Grappler+™, Buffer- 
board™, ECHO][™ Talking Demonstration.

THE BASIC 




By Wm.V R.Smith 



David Durkee subs for William V.R. Smith this month. 



As you become more skilled in your use of 
Basic, you are bound to stumble sooner or later 
on the hexadecimal numbering system, or base 
sixteen. If you start dealing with memory loca- 
tions directly, you'll find that when read in 
decimal, most of the important ones appear to 
have been randomly selected. For instance, the 
locations of the two hi-res screens are 8192 and 
16384. Why those numbers? Well, in hex- 
adecimal, or hex, the numbers are expressed as 
$2000 and $4000. 

In binary, or base two, which is really the 
base the microprocessor works in, the numbers 
are %0010 0000 0000 0000 and %0100 0000 
0000 0000. The dollar sign preceding the hex 
numbers and the percent sign in front of the 
binary numbers are standard ways of indicating 
those number bases. Sixteen-digit binary 
numbers are broken into four-digit groups 
for clarity. At its highest levels, the Apple 
translates all numbers into decimal for you. At 
the lower levels, like the Monitor and the disas- 
sembler, numbers are expressed in 
hexadecimal. 

The hex system is used at the lower levels 
because it is a closer representation of the 
original binary number. You'll notice that each 
of the four-digit groups within the binary 
numbers corresponds to a single digit of the hex 
numbers. Each zero in hex becomes four zeros 
when translated to binary. The 2 and the 4 in the 
hex numbers become 0010 and 0100. Of 
course, a four-digit hex number is less unwield- 
ly than a sixteen-digit binary number. 

There is no easy correspondence between 
binary and decimal. Since everything in the 
computer, from the number of bytes in a 64K 
system (65,536) to the number of different 
values that one byte can hold (256), is based on 
powers of two, it makes a lot of sense to use a 
number system that relates to binary easily. 
Which is why the Monitor, assemblers, disk- 
zap utilities, memory maps, and other advanced 
references all use hex. If they use decimal too, 
that's an extra. Even DOS accepts parameters 
in hex as well as in decimal. 



Basic and assembly language make a great 
team. Basic provides ease of programming, and 
assembly language can provide the speed that 
Basic lacks, when it's absolutely necessary. If, 
as a Basic programmer, you ever want to use 
assembly language from one of your programs, 
or even if you just want to call a Monitor 
routine from one of your programs, you wUl at 
some time be called upon to translate numbers 
back and forth between hex and decimal. 

The Base Converter program listed here can 
do the translating for you— not only between 
decimal and hex, but to and from binary as 
well. When you run the program, a three- 
column template appears on the screen with 
headers for the three number bases. A menu at 
the bottom prompts: 

NUMBER BASE (1 -3) OR 4 -CLEAR OR 
5 -EXIT 

The numbers one to three refer to the column 
headings. To translate a number from one base 
to both of the others, hit the number associated 
with that base. The cursor will move to the col- 
umn of your choice and the message at the bot- 
tom will change to: 

HIT ESCAPE TO GET MENU. 

At that time, you can start typing numbers in the 
chosen base. When you hit return, the number 
you've typed will be translated to the other two 
bases. The input routines used won't allow you 
to type in illegal characters. For decimal, you 
can enter only digits 0 through 9. For hex, you 
can enter 0 through 9 and A through F. For 
binary, your choices are limited to 1 and 0. You 
don't need to type the identifying dollar and 
percent signs; the number's column indicates 
which base it is in. 

There are also restrictions on the lengths of 
the numbers. Hex numbers can have four digits, 
binary numbers can have sixteen, and decimal 
numbers can have five. Since some five-digit 
decimal numbers (any number greater than 
65,535) can't translate to four-digit hex or 



sixteen-digit binary, there's a provision for an 
error message in the output routine should such 
a number be entered. 

Here's the program. Enjoy.

your Apple teach you to program in BASIC! 



BASIC TUTOR makes learning BASIC easy. With it 
your Apple will give you step-by-step instruction in 
handling all the fundamental elements of the BASIC 
language. 

BASIC TUTOR begins in lesson one by assuming you 
have no knowledge of programming. By the end of the 
last lesson you will be writing carefully planned, well- 
constructed programs of your own. 

BASIC TUTOR is interactive, prompting you with 
questions to which you will respond at the keyboard. 
Positive reinforcement is given with each correct 
answer, and specific aid is provided with each incorrect 
answer to help lead you in the right direction. Also, 
frequent summaries and reviews help make your new 
knowledge stick. 

BASIC TUTOR was designed for self-instruction. You 
can work at your own pace to optimize your learning 
curve. And BASIC TUTOR is fully compatible with 
Applesoft BASIC, so that any original programs you 
write will immediately run on your Apple computer. 



BASIC TUTOR was written for SuperSoft by 
Courseware Applications, one of the pioneers in 
Computer Aided Instruction. Courseware Applications 
has had extensive experience in all areas of C.A.I. , 
including corporate training programs, educational 
instruction (including programs for the international 
PLATO network), and military simulation courses. This 
experience has helped make BASIC TUTOR 
Computer Aided Instruction at its best. 

With BASIC TUTOR you can turn your Apple into the 
greatest teacher you've ever had. So start learning 
BASIC today - with BASIC TUTOR.

In the beginning, there were only programmers and hobbyists, and 
the difference between the two was mostly a matter of degree. Beyond 
those haves, there were only the have-nots. Today there's a vast and con- 
stantly growing middle class of microcomputerdom, the users. As a pro- 
grammer, you have a responsibility to those users. 

When you write a program entirely for your own use, it doesn't really 
matter how easy it is to run. Even if you planned nothing beforehand, 
you have a way of learning a program as you write and debug it. The 
user doesn't have the benefit of all that trial-and-error experience at the 
program's inception. For that reason, it's a good idea to incorporate 
some sort of help into your programs. A manual is fine, but something 
that will pop up on the screen when the user feels stuck or confused is 
sometimes better. 

There are lots of ways to go about helping the user from within a pro- 
gram. Two programs published by Apple, Apple Writer II and Quick File 
II, take contrasting approaches to the same issue. Each provides help in 
a way that is appropriate to the nature of the program. 



dined to use a help screen that pops up when they need it and disappears 
quietly into the ether when its work is done than one that makes them 
wait. The program contained in this article is intended to demonstrate 
that observation by the way it handles its own help screens while making 
it easier to create appealing help screens for your own programs. 

It's difficult to create a help screen from within an Applesoft pro- 
gram, because an Applesoft program isn't all that easy to edit. There's a 
lot of trial and error: sometimes more error than you would like. Print 
statements have an annoying way of not lining things up the way you 
want them to. The problem is less severe if you have a good program 
editor like PLE, but it's still a problem. 

So how else can you create a help screen for an Applesoft program? 
Try editing the screen itself. Last month's Ilnd Grade Chats explained a 
technique for reserving as much contiguous memory, starting with text 
page two, as you might need for help screens. It also demonstrated a way 
of moving screens full of information from what the author called the 
"phantom text pages" to either of the two displayable pages. With Help!

Help? It's Another Kit! 

This One Makes Help Screens 

by David Durkee 



Dueling Menus. Apple Writer //has one essential mode. Within that 
mode it offers a plethora of commands. For that reason (probably), the 
program has one central help menu. From that menu the user can call up 
a help screen on almost any subject pertaining to editing and printing 
with Apple Writer. 

Quick File II, on the other hand, has a number of different menus and 
modes and several different sets of command keys. For that reason, this 
program has more than one help screen. Rather than giving you a help 
menu encompassing the whole program, Quick File helps you with 
whatever mode you are in at the time. 

Both programs load the help information from disk when the user 
asks for it. Both also deal with large amounts of data in memory. The 
more memory available for data, the more valuable this kind of program 
is to its users. If you're writing a program that doesn't require so much 
data storage— most don't come near to using the whole 48 or 64K— and 
you want to include a help screen or two, it may be best to have the help 
screens coresident in memory with the program. People are more in- 



Edit, this month's program, you'll be able to edit and save text screens to 
put in those holes. 

An Overview of the Program. The program's main function is to 
allow you to edit and save a help screen. Basically, the printable charac- 
ters you type appear on-screen at the position of the cursor. Of course 
there are a few control-character commands to embellish the program. 
For starters, there's control-P, which toggles between inverse and nor- 
mal printing. (The program makes no provision for flashing because 
flashing messages are annoying to the eyes and make the cursor harder to 
find.) Control- V toggles between horizontal printing and vertical print- 
ing. (Don't ask why anyone would want vertical printing. Someone will 
come up with a reason.) Control-L acts as a caps lock for the Apple II 
Plus. In lower-case mode, the program uses the standard one- wire shift- 
key mod to shift between upper and lower case. 

You have complete control over the cursor's position on the screen, 
except that you can't use the bottom line, for reasons that will be ex- 
plained later. Cursor movement is accomplished by means of the four ar- 



210

rows on the Apple lie or by using the two arrows and control-A and con- 
trol-Z for up and down movement on the n Plus. In addition, control-C 
places the cursor in the upper left comer of the currentiy active window 
(that is, the area of the text screen you're currently working on). Because 
the cursor direction keys wrap to the opposite side when you run over an 
edge, control-C leaves you only one or two keys away from any of the 
comers. 

Normally this window is open to the fiill forty-column width of the 
screen and the top twenty -three lines. You can limit this window to a 
smaller area by moving the cursor and pressing control-T or control-B. 
Control-T sets new values for the top and left edges based on the cursor 
position. Control-B does the same thing for the bottom and right edges. 
Hitting control-W returns you to a full-size window. 

The window isn't just a way to restrict cursor movement. A window 
permits you to perform block operations. You can erase the window 
without touching text that lies outside of it by pressing control-E. By 
pressing control-F, you can make a frame out of inverse spaces around 
the edges of the window. This command has the additional effect of 
shrinking the window by one character space at all four edges so that the 
characters you type afterward don't overlap the frame. 

The window concept is also essential for a special input mode, in- 
voked with control-S. Special input allows you to enter text that is either 
centered within the window or flush against the right or left edge. This 
mode is useful for making formatted lists. Flush left is considered nor- 
mal, so a control-N makes the text on the current line flush left. Flush 
right and centered text are control-R and control-C respectively. The left 
arrow deletes characters from the end of the string. The control-L and 
control-P toggles still of)erate in special input mode, but none of the 
other commands work here. Escape brings you back to regular mode. 

Finally, there's a DOS menu for saving text screens, loading previ- 
ously saved screens, and cataloguing the disk. Load and save allow you 
to enter file names; catalog allows you to change the drive number. If 
you want to load from or save to a different drive than the one you ran 
the program from, all you have to do is catalog the new drive first. As 
with the special input mode, escape puts you back in the regular mode. 
The DOS menu also provides the way out of the program, a quit option. 

If you have any trouble remembering all this when you mn the pro- 
gram, refer to the two built-in help screens. One is for regular mode and 
the other is for special input mode. Both are invoked with control-I. The 
I stands for information, but using that character also means that the tab 
key on the lie becomes a help key. 

Internal Affairs. The first thing to do is reserve the necessary 
memory, as shown last month. We need only one extra text page to work 
with, so the program's start address will be right after text page two. The 
address is 3072, or $C00. This hello program sets up the program start 
address and mns the main program: 

10 POKE 104,12: POKE 103,1: POKE 3072,0 
20 PRINT CHR$( 4);"RUN HELP.EDIT" 

This hello program has to be separate from the main program because 
the pokes just change the pointers and don't move the program itself. 
When the main program, which must have the file name Help. Edit, is 
loaded, it will begin at the new address. 

To begin, initialize a new disk with this two-liner as the hello pro- 
gram or save it on an existing disk as Help. Hello, or something similar. 
The important thing to remember is that, when you're getting started, 
you must run this program first, not the main program. If you mn the 
main program with the starting address still at $800, the program will go 
down in flames— crash and bum— the first time you invoke a help screen 
or the DOS menu. This point can't be stressed enough. 

Disclaimer. By the way, if you're having trouble following any of 
this, look for much of the necessary background information in last 
month's Ilnd Grade Chats. 

Once you've saved the hello program, mn it. You'll get a file-not- 
found error, but the pointers will still be set up correctly. Type new and 
you're ready to begin entering Help! Edit. Here's the initialization 
section.

Lines 10010 through 10050 set up a small machine lanuage routine at 
$300 (768). This routine sets up for and calls the Monitor memory move 
routine, as described last month. Most of the rest of initialization consists 
of assigning cmcial variables. Line 10070 defines the fiill-size text win- 
dow. The four variables stand for top, bottom, left, and right edges. 

The Bottom Line Is You Can't Use It. The reason the bottom edge 
is set to 23 instead of 24 is that the Apple's screen output routine has a 
nasty habit of scrolling the screen up one line if anything is printed in the 
last position of line 24. To avoid having this happen, we're using the bot- 
tom line exclusively as a reminder that a help screen is available and to 
tell users how to get it. Line 10120 prints that message. When you 
are typing the message in, make sure it contains exactly thirty-nine 
characters. The poke 2039,32 puts an inverse space in the last character 
position without going through the normal output routine, so the screen 
doesn't scroll up and the line looks complete. 

This next section is the main keyboard interpreter. A keyboard inter- 
preter is necessary because the program is designed to work as well on an 
Apple n Plus with a lower-case chip and a shift-key mod installed as it 
does on a He, and this requires a section to handle lower case. If you 
have an Apple lie, or if you have an Apple n or n Plus without lower 
case, omit lines 40 through 130 if you want. (If you have a lower-case 
chip but no shift-key modification, you really should get the modifica- 
tion. It costs less than five dollars and is easy to install. If you insist on 
using escape or some control key to signify upper case, you'll have to 
modify this routine to handle it. Now wouldn't it be easier to buy the 
shift-key mod?)

The next section is called main input, although it has no input state- 
ment in it. The main input section actually uses the previous section to 
get one character. If the character is a control character (ASCII value 
less than 32), it is passed on to the control character handler. Otherwise 
the character is printed on-screen and cursor positioning is handled after- 
ward. The variable PD (line 250) means print direction. If it equals zero, 
the cursor moves down instead of to the right after printing a character.

The control command handler has a couple of different ways of deal- 
ing with control characters. Some characters send the machine to a sepa- 
rate routine. Others just change the values of a variable or two. Take a 
look at line 350. This line and the two following are toggle switches. The 
statement PD = not PD means that if PD equals zero, it becomes equal 
to one. If it's one, it becomes zero. Although the variable is a full 
floating point number like any other, we are using it as a simple two-state 
switch: on and off. 

Each line in this section contains a remark noting which characters 
are acted upon and what they do. These remarks are there to help you 
change or debug the program.

Move It! Coming up is a routine that does block memory moves. The 
memory move is an intricate part of the multiple text page technique, the 
idea for which was presented last month. This routine acts only on text 
pages one and two; we aren't using the phantom pages. Depending on the 
value of MD, it either moves from page one to page two or vice versa. If 
you adapt this routine to your own programs, don't forget to poke in 
the six bytes of machine language at the beginning of the initializa- 
tion section. 

The three parameters needed for start, end, and destination— to be 
poked into the two-byte locations 60, 62, and 66— are discussed in the 
Apple II Reference Manual section on the Monitor move command. Also 
in that manual are some tricks to using the move routine that you might ' 
find interesting. Caution is advised: Faulty parameters in these locations 
can blow away DOS, your program, and anything else in RAM.

The next section, a long one, shows what we meant about creating 
help screens out of print statements. You may have to go through a fair 
amount of agony to get everything lined up correctly. Paying careful at- 
tention to the remarks on string lengths will make matters go more 
smoothly. 

You'll notice that the first thing this routine does is call the memory 
move routine. This places the text page you're working on into page two 
for safekeeping. It might have been worthwhile to put this help screen on 
page two and just hit the screen switch to display it. However, a section 
of this screen will change based on certain variable values, so it behooves 
us to use text page one, on which we can print directly. The same is true 
for the other help screen and the DOS menu, both of which appear later 
in the program. 

At the end of the help section, the move routine is called again to 
move the text back to page one.

The special input mode is like a separate program inside the main 
one. It has its own output routine, control command handler, and help 
screen. Special input really is a whole different mode. The normal input 
method places characters where the cursor was at the time and leaves 
them there. This mode handles more lines. The maximum length of the 
line it can handle is based on the current window settings. As you enter a 
string to go on the current line within the current window, special input 
mode automatically displays the line in the specified format: flush left, 
flush right, or centered.

•APPLE IS A REGISTERED TRADE MARK OF YOU-KNOW-WHO 



BEAGLE BASIC 

APPLESOFT ENHANCER 
by MARK SIMONSEN 



Requires Apple lie (or 11/11+ with RAM Card)— 
Normally, Applesoft is unchangeable. What you 
see is what you get. But BEAGLE BASIC puts 
Applesoft into RAM, letting you customize and 
enhance it. The following functions may be 
added at ZERO COST IN MEMORY- 
RENAME ANY COMMAND or Error Mes- 
sage. You can literally re-write Applesoft with 
new commands. For program protection, encryp- 
tion, or even foreign translation! Even the new 
commands that follow are re-nameable: 
ELSE: Common in many programming lan- 
guages, but missing from Applesoft until now. 
ELSE follows If-Then statements, ,,Hke this— 
IF X=2 THEN PRINT "Yes": ELSE PRINT "No" 
SWAP: Normally, to swap two variable values, 
you need a 3rd variable & an extra split-second. 
SWAP X,Y exchanges values in one quick step. 
TONE: Beagle Basic's TONE P, L command 
plays a note of Pitch P, Length L. It's simple— no 
messy Pokes or Calls are ever necessary. 
HSCRN: If you have ever used Lo-Res's SCRN 
command, you'll appreciate HSC^N X,Y for find- 
ing the off/on status of any hi-res dot. 
TXT2: Allows Text Page 2 to act like Page 1 , for 
printing, listing, etc. Switching pages opens up all 
kinds of programming possibilities. 
MIX, PAGE, RESL and MODE: No more 
awkward graphics screen-switch pokes. For ex- 
ample, type PAGE1 or PAGE2 to switch pages, 
instead of POKE -16300,0 or POKE -16299,0 
{never look-up those darn Pokes again!). 
GOTO & GOSUB may now be followed by 
variables. Use English-like commands such as 
"GOSUB COUNTER" or "GOTO SONG", where 
COUNTER and SONG have been assigned line- 
number values. "GOTO 3+X", etc., legal too. 
ESCAPE-CURSOR: Normally, you can't tell 
if you are in Escape Mode (moving the cursor). 
With Beagle Basic, hitting ESC temporarily 
changes the normal cursor to a flashing "+". 
BETTER BEEP: Select one-of-many more 
pleasing tones for Apple's control-G Bell. 
PLUS: Bonus Screen Formatter & Editor, new 
1-word commands to replace awkward Apple 
text Calls, new commands to scroll text up and 
down, not possible before Beagle Basic. And... 

INVERSE REM STATEMENTS Too: 

Makes REM-statements appear as bold stand- 
out headlines in your Applesoft listings.

2-WAY-SCROLL / MULTIPLE UTILITY 
by MARK SIMONSEN 

A hundred times a day, you type "CATALOG" 
and "LIST", and the appropriate data dutifully> 
appears on your monitor... then promptly scrolls 
off the top of the screen into Hyper-Space. If the 
information you are looking for goes by, you 
must List or Catalog again to find it. 
Double-Take has a solution— 

2-WAY-SCROLLING 
List programs and Catalog disks with the added 
ability to CHANGE SCROLL-DIRECTION using 
the Apple Arrow Keys. Your monitor becomes a 
"Search Window" to be moved UP AND DOWN 
through Catalogs and Listings at will. 
IMPROVED LIST-FORMAT:* (optional) 
Each program state- 



ment is listed on a 
new line for easy 
tracing of program 
flow, and efficient, 
FAST de-bugging. 

Commands are 
properly-spaced (1- 
space between 
words, not two) and 
much easier to fol- 
low. Printer listings, 
in any width, are sup- 
ported too.

PRONTO-DOS 

HIGH-SPEED DOS/DOS-MOVE UTILITY 
by TOM WEISHAAR 

PRONTO-DOS triples the speed of Apple's Disk 
Operating System, adds new DOS features, and 
lets you load DOS into auxiliary memory for an 
EXTRA 10K of programmable memory space! 
Here is a co mparison with normal Apple DOS— 

Function Nomial Pronio 

BLOAD HI-RES IMAGE 10 sec. 3 sec, 

LOAD 60-SECTOR PROGRAM 16 sec. 4 sec. 
SAVE 60-SECTOR PROGRAM 24 sec. 9 sec. 
BLOAD LANGUAGE CARD .. 13 sec. 4 sec. 

(Text Files: no change) 

New, unprotected, high-speed disks (as many as 
you want), are created with the normal INIT 
command. Or your existing disks may be 
updated. Booting Pronto or any updated disk in- 
stalls high-speed DOS in your Apple. 

Moving DOS to your Apple II or 11+ RAM Card 
or Apple He standard high-memory will free up a 
whopping 10,000 EXTRA BYTES (that's 10K!) of 
valuable programmable memory space. 

ProntoDOS gives you 15 EXTRA SECTORS of 
disk storage space, almost one full track! This is 
space that is normally wasted by Apple DOS. 

With ProntoDOS in your Apple, all disk cata- 
logs will feature a Free-Space-On-Disk display, 
every time you Catalog. A great benefit! 

ProntoDOS allows you to add a handy new 
"TYPE" COMMAND that reveals the contents of 
Apple Text Files. For example, the command 
"TYPE INFO" will print everything (to screen or 
printer) that is in the Text file named "INFO". 

ProntoDOS is compatible with all DOS Com- 
mands, GPLE® and most of your programs.

At Long Last, DOS. This section starts out like the two help screens, 
by saving the text screen on page two and usurping page one for its own 
use. In another sense it's also like the special input mode: It has its own 
command interpreter and its own set of commands. In this case, the com- 
mands aren't control characters, but they're interpreted in essentially the 
same way. This section doesn't have its own help screen, but it does have 
a commands list at the top of the screen. The commands shown here 
allow you to catalog a disk, save the text screen you're working on, load 
a text screen that was previously saved, and quit. Returning to the main 
section of the program is accomplished by hitting escape. 

Look closely at the way errors are handled in this section. This is 
about the minimum amount of error handling you need in order to pre- 
vent the user from crashing your program by leaving a disk drive door 
open, mistyping a file name, or causing other DOS-related errors that 
can happen to anyone. DOS errors usually result from a user mistake and 
not from a fault in the program, so it's almost always a good idea to put 
trapping like this around DOS commands. 

The secret is not to overdo it. If you put one onerr goto in the listing 
and have it cover the whole program, you're going to run into trouble. 
Onerr suppresses normal error handling, including the messages that 
help you find bugs in programs. The best idea is to turn error trapping on 
immediately before a DOS command and off immediately afterward. 
You'll notice that even catalog has an onerr before it and a poke 216,0 
folowing. After all, you can always enter a nonexistent drive number. 

The Surgeon General Warns. . . . Speaking of possible errors, 
here's one that isn't protected against. Don't attempt to bload a file that 
wasn't created by this program. The bload command used here forces the 
file to load at $800, the beginning of the second page. If the file is longer 
than a text page, it's crashing time. You have been warned, so now 
you'll know what to say when a friend asks you what happens if you try 
to edit a hi-res picture. 

You should also note that this routine bsaves screens at the address 
$800: text page two, where your working screen was moved when this 
section was entered. Keep that in mind when you're loading the screen 
from another program. If that program's start address is $800 (in other 
words, if you didn't change the pointers as we did before running this) 
and you load the picture there, the first 1 ,024 bytes of your program will 
disappear. There are less painful ways for a program to die. 

(Remember, though, if you don't crash the system at least once in the 
development of a program, you're not doing serious work. Beginners 
never get the chance to wreak this kind of havoc.) 

Deciding where to load the file relates to some other considerations, 
but they can wait until the end of the article.

How you use the screens created by this program will depend on the 
program you're trying to document. If you want to conserve memory, 
but you have several screens' worth of helpful information, you'll prob- 
ably want to keep each screen on disk and bload it when it's asked for. If 
that's the case, and your program doesn't depend on a carefully format- 
ted text screen itself, you might find it easiest to bload the help screen 
right on top of text page one and then scroll it away when the user is 
finished with it. 

An approach that will look more professional is to load the help 
screen into text page two and then page flip to display that page. The flip 
command is poke 49237,0. The text command gets your original display 
back intact. A couple of things to remember: If you're going to use text 
page two, reset the start-of-program pointer as we did for this program. 
If you're going to load it into text page one, or anyplace other than page 
two where it was saved from, you're going to have to tell DOS the ad- 
dress with the A parameter when you bload. A$400 gets you text page 
one, for instance. 

Recipe for Help Screen Extraordinaire. If you have lots of memory 
handy and plenty of help screens to display, there is a preferred way of 
doing it. Load all the help screens into memory at once. Start at location 
3072 ($C00) for the first one and proceed from there, loading each 
screen at a location 1 ,024 ($400) bytes after the start of the previous one. 
When they're all loaded, reset the start of program pointer to 1 ,024 bytes 
after the beginning of the last help screen and load your main program. 

Use text page one exclusively for the interactive part of your pro- 
gram. When the user asks for help, have your program use the memory 
move routine to put the appropriate screen in text page two and flip the 
page to display it. The parameters for the memory move will be fairly 
simple. The destination address will always be 2048. The starting ad- 
dress will be the address you loaded the particular screen into in the first 
place, and the ending address will be the starting address plus 1,023. 
When you've finished with the help page, just flip back with the text 
command. You don't have to move anything. 

One more thing. Once you've got the help screens all set up, you can 
tidy up your catalog by bloading them all in sequence and bsaving them 
as one file. Keep the individual files handy in case there's an error in one 
and you have to go back into Help! Edit to fix it. Having all the help 
screens in one file also sj)eeds up the process of loading them and height- 
ens the gee-whiz effect when you're showing the program to your 
friends. 

Whether this program really helps you impress people depends most- 
ly on their innate capacity to be impressed. Whether it helps people who 
are trying to use your programs, on the other hand, depends more on 
you. You have to plan out what the screens are going to say and how the 
user will invoke them. Is your program going to have menu-driven help 
screens like Apple Writer, or a separate screen or set of screens for each 
mode, like Quick Filel Design a method based around your program and 
how it works, of course. If you can't make something useful out of these 
techniques, all they are is fancy page flipping. 

So good luck, and have fun.

The History of Everything— Sort Of. Way 

back in the old days, there were these things 
called typewriters. In some ways, they resem- 
bled computers; you would press a key, and the 
corresponding character would show up on a 
piece of paper that was secured in the device's 
"carriage." 

The typewriter. Reporters reported with 
them, writers sat for hours by them, and musi- 
cians occasionally used them as a percussion 
device. 

Though they looked really complicated on 
the inside, their operation was quite simple. 
You pressed a key and a series of joints and 
levers raised the appropriate hammer to the rib- 
bon, leaving an inked impression of the charac- 
ter on the paper. 

Though it's not the same thing with com- 
puters, it's easy to imagine some kind of invisi- 
ble hammer raising itself to the screen when we 
press a key on the Apple's keyboard. But it's 
not that simple. In this session of bold truth, 
we're going to take a quick look at how all those 
characters get from your mind to the keys to the 
screen. 

First, we'll look at how the display on your 
screen is related to what's in the computer's 
memory. We'll also look at how you (yes, you) 
can tinker around with what's inside the Ap- 
ple's RAM. Finally, we'll find out how all those 
ABCs and 1, 2, 3s get on the screen where we 
can see them. 

Up Periscope. The first thing we ought to 
understand is what the screen is showing us. 
The computer screen is sort of like a window; 
it's a window to what's going on inside the com- 
puter's memory. There are tens of thousands 
of memory addresses in your Apple, and the 
screen shows you what's inside just a few of 
them. Imagine, if you will, looking at the night 
sky through a telescope. Though you can see 
only a few stars, you know there are lots more 
outside of your viewing area. That small view- 
ing area is comparable to what you see on your 
computer screen. 

Certain areas of memory are devoted to 
displaying things on the screen. The screen lets 
you see what's going on in those areas. 

Memory addresses in the Apple are num- 



bered from 0 to 65535 ($0000 to $FFFF in 
hexadecimal). Picture the Apple's memory as a 
gigantic grid of 65,536 post office boxes; each 
one of these boxes represents a memory ad- 
dress, or one byte of memory. 

Now let's suppose we are in charge of the 
post office. That means we can put things in, 
and look into, any box we choose. Well, al- 
most. We can examine the contents of any 
memory address, but we can't put things into all 
of them. That's because part of the Apple's 
memory includes ROM, the contents of which 
aren't to be fooled with. A few months ago, we 
learned that ROM is where programs like the 
Monitor and the Applesoft interpreter reside. If 
any of these were tampered with (they can't be, 
so don't worry), all heck would break loose. 

The best way to keep track of what things go 
where is to refer to each address by its number 
and not by what its function is. For the same 
reasons that the postman refers to boxes by their 
numbers and not by who's using them, we refer 
to memory locations by their addresses and not 
by what's stored there. Addresses (box num- 
bers) stay the same, no matter what values are 
stored there (no matter who is using the post of- 
fice box). 

It's None of Our Business, but Who 
Cares? The way you look at a memory address 
is not much different from the way you look at 
anything you're not supposed to see— you peek 
at it. And it just so happens that peek is the word 
the computer understands. From Applesoft, 
type in the following: 

PRINT PEEK (0) 
PRINT PEEK (152) 
PRINT PEEK (55300) 

Print tells the Apple that you want it to display 
on-screen the result of whatever you type next. 
Peek tells it to look (take a peek) inside an ad- 
dress. And the number inside the parentheses is 
the address you're telling it to look at. You can 
use this print peek command with any number 
from 0 through 65535, which represent 
memory addresses. 

The number that shows up when you hit re- 
turn is the value that's currently residing at that 
address. Isn't it fun being nosey? We hope the 



postman doesn't do this sort of peeking into 
people's post office boxes to see what kind of 
maU they receive. 

You're Gonna Poke Somebody's Byte 
Out! Putting things into memory addresses is 
not unlike sorting mail. The postal worker takes 
a piece of mail, figures out which box it goes in, 
and shoves it in there. For us, we figure out the 
value (byte) we want an address to hold, and we 
poke it in. All set to try a few? Here goes:

OCTOBER 1983 



(You may notice some unusual behavior on 
the screen after this one. Type normal to make 
things work right again.) 

POKE 39122,4 

Poke tells the Apple that we want to change 
the value that's stored at a memory address. 
The first number tells which address to change, 
and the number after the comma is the value we 
want that address to hold. Though addresses are 
numbered up to 65535, we can change ad- 
dresses only up to 49151; all addresses above 
that belong to the sacred realm of ROM. Don't 
touch anything there. 

Depending on which addresses you're pok- 
ing into and what values you're poking in, all 
sorts of weird stuff can happen. But let's not get 
too weird yet; let's get back to the original 



subject — how the Apple displays things on the 
screen. 

The addresses between 1024 and 2047 are 
where the Apple stores values that decide what 
you see on the text and lo-res graphics screen 
(text and lo-res share the same area of memory, 
remember?). Here's an illustration of what 
we mean. 

Our First Program. Type in the following 
short program. If you've never typed in an Ap- 
plesoft program before, don't worry. It's really 
simple; just type it in exactly as you see it (don't 
worry about indenting). Include the line num- 
bers and remember to hit the return key at the 
end of each line. 

10 HOME 

20 FOR A = 1024 TO 2047 

30 POKE A, 128 * RND(1) + 128 



40 NEXT A 

All finished? Now just type run and watch 
the action. If you get the message ? syntax error 
in 10 ox something similar to that, check the line 
number it tells you is wrong and make sure you 
typed it in exactly as it's shown. To correct it, 
just retyf)e the line in question. 

You may never need a program that does 
what this one does, but here's an explanation of 
what's going on. Line 10 clears the screen. Line 
20 says we have a variable, A, that will repre- 
sent all the integers between 1,024 and 2,047, 
beginning with 1 ,024 (we eliminate the commas 
in these numbers because commas are a no-no 
in programming). Line 30 performs the poke 
command, just like the one we learned. It goes 
to address A and jwkes in a random number be- 
tween 128 and 255. Don't worry about that silly 
math formula; all it does is generate the random 
number. Line 40 tells variable A to increase to 
the next number in the series that was set in 
line 20. 

It's as though we typed: 

POKE 1024, A 
POKE 1025, A 
POKE 1026, A 



POKE 2047, A 

where A is a random number. Geez, that's more 
than a thousand pokes! But that still doesn't ex 
plain how all that garbage got on the screen. 

The Numbers Whence Garbage Was 
Born. The reason our random numbers were 
kept between 128 and 255 is that those numbers 
represent the letters and symbols on the key- 
board. The numbers between 0 and 127 also 
represent characters, but they're a bit messier. 
When the program starts poking around, it be- 
gins with address 1024. Suppose it comes up 
with the random number 130, which stands for 
the letter B. It takes the value of 130 and pokes 
it into address 1024, which displays the letter B 
in the upper left-hand comer of the screen. 

Next, it goes to 1025, generates another ran- 
dom number, pokes that value into address 
1025, and, depending on the value, displays an- 
other character in the position on the screen 
next to our letter B. This nonsense continues un- 
til it reaches 2047 and pokes a value into that 
address. 

(If you're on your toes you might have no- 
ticed a discrepancy here. There are 1,024 ad- 
dresses from 1024 to 2047. But there are only 
960 places to put characters on the screen: forty 
columns by twenty-four rows. What happened 
to the extra sixty-four addresses? Don't worry 
about it. Those extra addresses don't belong to 
the screen, so nothing shows up when values 
are poked into them.) 

The way those values in memory are sent to 
the screen is pretty complex. But in a nutshell, 
what happens is that the computer scans through 
all the memory addresses several times a sec- 
ond. The values it finds in addresses 1024 
through 2047 are translated into alphanumeric 
characters according to the ASCII code. ASCII 
(pronounced askee) stands for American Stan- 
dard Code for Information Interchange.

an idea how the computer translates ASCII code 
into something we can read, try out the follow- 
ing program. Type new to delete the previous 
program, and enter this short one. 

10 HOME 

20 FOR X = 0 TO 255 
30 POKE 1024 + X, X 
40 NEXTX 

This one works almost like the previous one, 
but instead of poking in random numbers it 
pokes in the numbers from 0 to 255 in order. 
When you run the program you'll see that 
numbers 0 through 63 create inverse characters, 
black characters on a white background. The 
next sixty-four numbers create flashing charac- 
ters, and the final 128 values— from 128 to 
255 — create characters in normal display. 

If you have an Apple II Reference Manual 
handy, turn to page 8, where you'll see a table 
that shows all the Apple's characters and their 
corresponding ASCII codes. The way you fig- 
ure out the codes is simple. Find the character 
whose code you wish to know, take the number 
at the top of its column, and add it to the number 
at the left side of the character's row. For exam- 
ple, to find the code for the letter M, add the 
number at the top of the column (192) to the 
number at the left-hand side of the row that M is 
in (13); M's ASCII code is 205. 

For owners of the Apple He Reference Man- 
ual, you don't have to add anything. On page 16 
there's a table with all the ASCU characters and 
their corresponding codes, 0 through 127, next 
to them.

Wait a Sec. Why do the ASCII codes in the 
II 's reference manual run from 128 to 255, and 
the He's from 0 to 127? Here's where things get 
unbelievably interesting. Now we get to inte- 
grate all that binary and hexadecimal stuff we 
learned about last month. 

We know that with an eight-bit byte we can 
generate 256 values (0 to 255). But the Apple 
generates only 128 characters. In reality, it's 
only the first seven bits that are used to create 
characters. The eighth, leftmost bit just sort of 
sits there until it's called on for something else 
that we'll get to in a moment. Here's a short 
program that will help illustrate what's going on 
(don't forget to type new before entering this 
program). 

10 HOME 

20 SPEED = 150 

30 FOR X = 0 TO 255 

40 PRINT X, CHR$(X) 

50 NEXTX 

60 SPEED = 255 

The program runs by pretty fast, but you can 
hit control-S to stop and start it at will. Control- 
C will stop the program permanently. When 
you run this program, the left-hand column 
shows the ASCII code, and the right-hand col- 
umn displays its corresponding character. For 
the first thirty or so codes, you won't see any 
characters. That's because most of them repre- 
sent control characters, which are invisible. 
Starting with ASCII code 33, you'll see various 
punctuation symbols followed by the alphabet. 
If your Apple can display lower-case letters, 
you'll see those from codes 97 to 122; if you 
don't have lower case, those codes will look 
like reruns of the punctuation symbols. 

But beginning with ASCII code 128, we see 
the whole sequence of characters all over again. 
What's going on? Did the people who thought 
of this system run out of ideas for characters? 
Well, no. 

Concentrate— It Gets Confusing Here. 

The Apple uses only the first seven bits in a byte 
to generate characters. That means only the 
bytes from 00000000 to 01 11 11 11 are used 
(that's the unemployed eighth bit on the far 
left). These represent ASCII codes 0 through 
127. The ASCII codes 128 through 255 are rep- 
resented by bytes 10000000 through 11111111 
(now that eighth bit is employed). Here's what's 
going on. 

A B 

01001000 and 11001000 
01000101 and 11000101 
01000011 and 11000011 
01001011 and 11001011 
Table of Paired Bytes 

Consider the bytes in the accompanying ta- 
ble. Notice any similarities within pairs? Each 
one on the right side is the same as its partner on 
the left, except that it has a 1 instead of a 0 in its 
left-hand (eighth) column. Whether this bit is 
a 0 or a 1 makes little difference to us, but it 
makes a big difference to the computer. 

In column A, those bytes represent the 
ASCII codes for the letters H, E, C, and K re- 
spectively. So do the bytes in column B. It sure 
seems dumb to have two codes that represent 
the same letter, but we needn't get too upset; 
the computer has its reason for requiring two 



ASCn codes for each character. 

When you press a key on the keyboard, you're 
sending the ASCII code for that key to location 
49152. At the same time, the eighth bit of that 
code is set "on," which tells the computer that 
a key has been pressed. An input routine in the 
Monitor scans that address, acting upon whatever 
it finds there. When it sees that you've put an 
ASCII code there by hitting a key, it takes note 
of it and switches the eighth bit to "off." That's 
all the eighth bit does; it tells the computer if the 
ASCU value it's looking at is there because 
somebody hit a key or if it was there since the 
last time the computer looked at that address. 

Neon Signs, Flashy Lights, and Other 
Ways To Gain Attention. To illustrate, suppose 
we're typing merrily along. When we hit the A 
key, for example, the ASCU code 193 goes fly- 
ing into memory with its eighth bit on, shouting 
"Hey, buddy, this key's been pressed!" When 
the 6502 looks at 49152, it sees the 193 sitting 
there, puts the letter A on the screen, and flips 
the eighth bit into its "off position. That's its 
way of saying, "Okay, I hear you already. Now 
shaddap!" i 

The Apple has to know if the bytes in mem- \ 
ory represent keys that have just been hit because 
that's how it figures out what to do. Let's say 
we're running a program that fires a cannon at 
your neighbor's house every time the left arrow 
key is pressed. When you hit the left arrow, the 
computer sees that eighth bit on, telling it that 
someone has just hit the left arrow. It takes note 
of the fact, flips the eighth bit off, and tells the i 
program to fire the cannon. The next time the \ 
6502 scans that address, if no one has hit the left 
arrow, the computer still sees the ASCU code for 
the left arrow at that memory address; but, be- 
cause the eighth bit is off, it knows no one has 
hit it since the last time, so it doesn't fire the 
cannon. 

Now let's suppose the computer couldn't tell 
if a key had just been pressed or not. When it 
sees the ASCU code for the left arrow, it goes 
and tells the program to fire the cannon. The next 
time around, it still sees the same ASCU code 
there and thinks it's supposed to fire the cannon 
again, even if no one has hit a key. To the com- 
puter, the left arrow key equals "Fire the can- 
non." The result is that thousands of cannonballs 
are being launched at your neighbor's house 
every second when you meant to fire only one. 

This example is a little extreme, but the im- 
portance of having two sets of ASCU codes for 
one set of characters should be a little clearer. 
(By the way, there's probably nothing illegal 
about writing programs that fire cannons at your 
neighbors' houses. However, laws p)ertaining to 
executing such programs might vary from state 
to state, so it's a good idea to check on these 
things before going whole hog at it.) 

Phew! Here at Last. That's basically how 
things work between the time you press a key and 
the time something shows up on the screen. There 
are all sorts of weird phenomena that occur at 
the keyboard ("Why is it that when I press the 
A, S, D, and F keys all at once, it shows up as 
'FD2SJA' or some variation of those charac- 
ters?") that are best left for experts to explain; 
that's their job. Our job is to find those experts 
and make them sweat by asking them hard ques- 
tions like that.

in vintage biplanes, visitor rides on the planes, 
and on-the-ground demonstrations of the game. 

□ Sierra On-Line (Coarsegold, CA) has 
revealed that Warner Publishing (New York, 
NY) offered to buy a controlling interest in the 
company earlier this year. According to John 
Williams, Sierra On-Line's entertainment 
product manager, Albert B. Litewka, president 
of Warner Software, offered Sierra On-Line an 
undetermined sum of between $10 million and 
$30 million for 50 percent of the company. 
Sierra On-Line broke off negotiations in June. 
"We are an entrepreneurial company and 
weren't sure we were ready for that kind of con- 
trol. It would take the fim out of things," Wil- 
liams said. 

□ Maps and InvisiClues once provided by the 
discontinued Zork Users Group (Milwaukee, 
WI) will be provided by Infocom (Cambridge, 
MA), said Michael R. Dombrook, founder of 
the user group. Infocom will sell the items at 
cost, making them less expensive than when 
they were available through the user group. 
Dombrook, who said that he will miss the Zork 
group, has been named product manager for en- 
tertainment software at Infocom. 

□ Apple Computer (Cupertino, CA) and ITT 



automated finance and lease division. The new 
system evaluates credit while the customer 
waits and allows dealers to be paid immediately 
from an ITT account. Customer payments then 
reimburse ITT. Dealers can access the system 
by modem and will reach an ITT computer that 
searches credit data banks and transmits infor- 
mation back to the credit officer. To be ap- 
proved, leases must include an Apple computer 
but may also include Apple-compatible equip- 
ment and software. 

□ ComputerLand (Hay ward, CA) has reor- 
ganized its executive structure to fit its size, 
said William Millard, chairman and foimder of 
ComputerLand. Edward E. Faber is continu- 
ing as chief operating officer, as well as becom- 
ing vice chairman. In addition, the corporation 
has been separated into four divisions, each 
with its own president. Division presidents are 
Michael Shabazian, formerly a senior vice 
president and now head of ComputerLand 
United States; Michael McConnell, formerly a 
senior vice president and now president of 
ComputerLand International; Kenneth 
Waters, formerly operations vice president and 
now president of ComputerLand Corporate 
Policy Division; and Barbara Millard, 
daughter of William Millard and president of 
IMS Associates, the Millard family holding 



company. Barbara Millard is now president of 
the ComputerLand corporate services division. 
Millard's mother, Patricia Millard , has been ap- 
pointed a member of the corporate management 
committee, which provides overall direction for 
the company. The other members are Faber and 
William Millard. 

ComputerLand has also launched a retail 
credit program in conjunction with Citibank 
(New York, NY). The cobranded Com- 
puterLand credit card allows qualifying 
customers to finance an initial purchase of 
$1,500 or more. After that, customers can fi- 
nance purchases that exceed $100. Card- 
holders have thirty days to repay the Citibank 
loan and are charged a $20 minimum monthly 
fee. Customers can apply by phone at par- 
ticipating ComputerLands and will receive a 
response within one hour. They can also send 
completed applications to Citibank for a 
response within thirty days. 
□ John Brockman Associates (New York, 
NY), a literary and software agency, has an- 
nounced the appointment of John C. Dvorak to 
the newly created position of technical advisor.

□ Thomas Measday, former vice president 
and general manager of Yardley of London, has 
joined Broderbund (San Rafael, CA) as its vice 
president of marketing and sales. According to 
Doug Carlston, president of Broderbund, 
"Measday 's impressive accomplishments in the 
toiletries field span management, creative de- 




velopment, advertising, and promotion. He im- 
plemented a restructuring program at Yardley 
that reversed ten years of unprofitable opera- 
tions, only one indication of Measday 's many 
talents." 

□ Program Design (Greenwich, CT), a pub- 
lisher of educational software, has announced 
the completion of a study to determine the ef- 
fects of computerized teaching aids on pre- 
school chDdren. The study, which was commis- 
sioned by PDI and supervised by preschool 
educators, observed twenty children (ten with 
computers and ten without) from the same 
socioeconomic background in Stamford, Con- 
necticut. Children were chosen from the same 
background to eliminate the effect of cultural

differences, said PDI president John Victor. 
Victor said that the results strongly justified the 
use of computers in preschool education. Chil- 
dren working with computers made a gain of 
47.4 percent in skills tests, while those without 
computers gained only 13.5 percent. The com- 
puter group also gained in confidence and the 
ability to make decisions, Victor said. 
□ The board of directors of Source Telecom- 
puting (McLean, VA) has appointed Bert Helf- 
instein president and chief executive officer.

replacing George Grune, who is now chairman 
of the board. Helfinstein, former president of I 
software publisher CGI Systems, will report di- 
rectly to Grune. "Bert Helfinstein has twenty 
years of proven success in computer-related I 
businesses, ten of those in top management. 
Equally important is the great enthusiasm that 
Bert has for his work and the vision he shares 
with us for the growth and success of STC," 
Grune said.

Electronic Arts capture the sport of basketball 
in a computer game, while Wilson is helping 
game designers translate his sense of humor to 
electronic media. Cartoons by Wilson have ap- 
peared in Playboy, the New Yorker, Punch, and

CAN A COMPUTER GAME 
MAGAZINE MAKE YOU CRY? 




H Right now, no one knows. This is partly because no 
one really cares. But it's also because whoever 
successfully answers this question must first answer 
some others. 

Why do we cry? Why do we laugh, or love? Why 
do we laugh at those who love to cry? 

Until now, the people who wondered about such 
things tended not to publish magazines about computer 
games. Instead, they went to Francis Ford Coppola 
movies. 

Information worthy of 
the paper it's printed on. 

Softline is nothing like a Coppola movie. It's a smile. In 
coming issues, Softline will perform a vivisection on the 
anatomy of games. Adventure expert Ken Rose leaves 
fantasy behind and brings you an adventure in the 
mundane. We'll explore the hows and whys of 



interactive fiction, taking an active part in a novel. 

We'll also have the usual bits of fun and 
melancholia. Contests, high scores, reviews. Not to 
mention the ever-popular Infomania madness. 

Read US. We're providing a special publication 

for talented, untalented, overexcited, or utterly confused 
gamers. Anything that breathes. Softline is a place for 
you to grow. And some of America's most respected 
journalists are shrugging their shoulders. 

We think our work reflects a special commitment.

THE 





TH 



By Jim Merritt 



Jungle Fever, Part 8 



When we discussed the Pascal compiler's source file inclusion facili- 
ty last April, we noted that it permits you to maintain libraries of fre- 
quently needed subroutines in the form of text files. For instance, the 
ubiquitous function Capital, which converts a lower-case alphabetic 
character to the corresponding upper-case one, could be kept in a text file 
named CAPITAL.TEXT. Once this text file existed, it would no longer 
be necessary to embed the full definition of Capital directly into the 
source text for each new program. Instead, the compiler directive 

(*$l CAPITAL*) 

could act as a place marker for the function definition. While scanning a 
program, the compiler would then replace the $1 directive with the actual 
contents of the CAPITAL.TEXT fde. It would be as if the definition of 
the function actually existed in the program source text at the site of the 
$1 directive. 

It is certainly quicker and easier to build a bookshelf from a kit of 
manufactured parts than to start with raw timber. By the same token, it is 
quicker and easier to build reliable programs from a library of pretested 
subroutines than it is to write all of the code from scratch. 

Unfortunately, the file inclusion facility provides at best a shaky 
foundation for the management of subroutine libraries. It is far better to 
maintain libraries in the form of object code instead of source text. For 
one thing, the source file for a given subroutine usually occupies far 
more disk space than the corresponding object file. In other words, a 
disk can accommodate a larger library if the routines are stored as object 
code. Furthermore, it is a waste of time to bother recompiling library 
routines on behalf of every program that uses them. Once they operate 
efficiendy and are free of errors, library routines should never be recom- 
piled. As we'll see, the Apple Pascal system is able to inject object code 
from a library file into that of a newly compiled program that uses library 
routines. Liriking a program to its library subroutines at the level of ob- 
ject code turns out to be a much faster process than merging source files 
during compilation, primarily because object code (p-code) is much 
more thoroughly condensed and "digestible" than source text. 

Apple Pascal permits you to group together not only subroutines but 
also data definitions and variable declarations in the form of a UNIT. 
These objects may be used by the UNIT'S clients, which may be PRO- 
GRAMS or even other UNITs. A library consists of one or more UNITs 
in a single code file. 

UNIT Structure: A Practical Example. UNIT CharTools, shown in 
listing 1 at the end of this article, provides its clients with several con- 
stants and subroutines that are usefiil in dealing with Char data. Char- 
Tools is representative of the typical UNIT. 

As indicated by the syntax diagrams of figure 1 , any UNIT may in- 
clude subroutines (procedures and functions), variables, data constant 
and type definitions, or a combination of any or all of these. CharTools 
defines only two constants and several subroutines. 

Like most UNITs, CharTools consists of two sections, the INTER- 
FACE and the IMPLEMENTATION. As a menu lists the dishes that a 



restaurant is prepared to serve, so CharTools 's INTERFACE section 
lists the objects that this UNIT provides to its clients. A client may access 
the INTERFACE section's variables, make use of its constants and data 
types, and call its subroutines just as if these objects had been defined in 
the client's own global declaration area. (The reverse is not generally 
true, however. In particular, a separately compiled UNIT cannot use ob- 
jects from within the client unless, for instance, the client supplies them 
as actual VAR parameters to one or more of the UNIT'S subroutines.) A 
computer scientist would say that the items declared in an INTERFACE 
section are public. 

The information given in an INTERFACE section tells a programmer 
the nature of any data objects that will be shared between the UNIT and 
a client, as well as the names and calling conventions for any subroutines 
provided by the UNIT. In general, the INTERFACE section specifies 
only what the UNIT does, not how it works. When you write a client 
program, you will have little or no need to know (for instance) exactly 
how the library package's subroutines work. Instead, you will be more 
concerned with calling the subroutines from your own code. You will 
need to know the names and purposes of any procedures or functions 
provided by a UNIT, as well as the number and types of parameters that 
these subroutines expect. You may also be concerned with the execution 
speed of one or more routines. But as long as a particular subroutine per- 
forms a useful function at an acceptable level of efficiency, you probably 
won't care how it does its job. 

The IMPLEMENTATION section is a UNIT'S "kitchen." Here are 
defined all subroutines declared in the INTERFACE. Any public data 
declared in the INTERFACE is known and available to objects defined in 
the IMPLEMENTATION section. However, additional subroutines and 
data not mentioned in the INTERFACE may also be defmed as part of 
the IMPLEMENTATION. These private objects cannot be "seen" or 
used by the UNIT's clients, in the same way that the chef, her assistants, 
and the kitchen itself remain unobserved by the typical restaurant patron. 
In its current incarnation, CharTools does not define any private data or 
subroutines. The only items defined in CharTools 's IMPLEMENTA- 
TION section are the bodies of the public subroutines. 

When we investigated SEGMENT subroutines last month, we found 
it necessary to separate subroutine declaration from subroutine definition 
in certain special situations. We saw how to use the keyword FOR- 
WARD to achieve such separation. In a UNIT, subroutines mentioned in 
the INTERFACE are implicitly declared as FORWARD. So, even 
though the keyword FORWARD is never used in the INTERFACE, you 
must define public subroutines according to the rules for subroutines 
declared FORWARD. In the INTERFACE, the complete PROCEDURE 
or FUNCTION heading must be given, along with a complete parameter 
list and FUNCTION-result type, if any. When a public subroutine is 
defined in the IMPLEMENTATION, it is introduceid by an abbreviated 
form of subroutine heading, which consists of the keyword PRO- 
CEDURE or FUNCTION, as appropriate, followed only by the 
subroutine name and a semicolon. In the INTERFACE declaration of 
Capital, for instance, note the presence of a full parameter list and result 



228 



OCTOBER 1983 



type. Now, look at the IMPLEMENTATION definition of Capital. At 
first, you might think that the parameter list and result type have been 
repeated, contrary to the rule just mentioned. But look more closely. All 
the information between the name of the subroutine and the semicolon 
that terminates the subroutine heading is contained within a comment. In- 
veterate programmers would probably say that the redundant parameter 
list and result type have been "commented out." Preserving an "echo" 
of a subroutine's full heading in the IMPLEMENTATION section is a 
good idea, because it helps you remain aware of the true nature of the 
routine while you are writing (or reading) it. 

Following the subroutine DigitValue are the keyword END and a 
period. This couplet concludes not only the IMPLEMENTATION sec- 
tion but also the CharTools UNIT itself. 

Writing a Client. A UNIT is clearly similar to a PROGRAM. Yet, 
there are crucial differences. For one thing, most PROGRAMS are self- 
contained; they can function independently of other software. Thus, you 
may execute them directly. On the other hand, any code in a UNIT must 
be invoked by a client. This being so, we must write a client for Char- 
Tools if we expect to use any of its subroutines. Listing 2 presents the 



PROGRAM CTTest, which you may use to estimate the execution speed 
of most of the subroutines in CharTools. 

Three things are remarkable in this compiler-generated listing of an 
otherwise undistinguished client program. 

First, access to the objects defined in CharTools is made possible 
through the USES declaration. This declaration consists of the keyword 
USES, followed by a list of identifiers that name the UNITs that the 
client employs, then a semicolon. For CTTest, the USES declaration 
contains only one identifier, CharTools. 

Second, the compiler directive instruction $U, followed by a file 
name as argument, tells the compiler to look for compiled UNITs in the 
specified file. If this instruction did not appear in the CTTest source text 
file prior to the identifier CharTools, the compiler would try to find 
CharTools in the file *SYSTEM. LIBRARY. This search would fail, and 
the compiler would report an instance of error #190 ("Unit not in 
library"). 

The last thing to notice about the listing of CTTest is that the INTER- 
FACE to CharTools has been inserted automatically by the compiler. 
This source code does not exist in the file CTTEST. TEXT! Whenever a

u Lompeie in the explosivl 
juter software industry, good enough 

>n't good enough. Your production 
technology must be as superior as your 
software products themselves. 

Software piracy is real. 

The Wall Street Journalreports that software pro- > 
ducers lost up to 36 million dollars to software 
piracy — in 1981! Current conservoWve esfimotes 
show five bootleg copies for every legal software 
diskette. And the more popular your software, the 
greater your loss. 

FORMASTER's COPYLOCK™ protection tech- 
nology stops almost 1 00 percent of software pira- 
cy. Our customers know we're the experts, and 
they include some of the most successful software 
firms in the industry. How much more profitable 
would you be with superior piracy protection? 

Bad news travels fast. 

Every unreadable copy you send out hurts your 
business reputation. The FORMASTER Series 
One diskette duplicator gives you the most accu- 
rate (readable) copies possible. We've designed 
it with uniquely intelligent recording and verifica- 
tion technology, self-checking memon/ and elec- 
tronics, special diskette alignment mechanisms, 
and more. How much more profitable would you 
be with superior copy quality? 

Production efficiency means 
money. 

The Series One produces up to 326 fully verified 
copies per hour. The same machine can copy 
5Va" {48TPI and 96TPI), 8", and now 372" disk- 
ettes. The Series One is the on// system with the 
designed-in flexibility to handle all diskette for- 
mats, including GCR formats such as Apple and 
Commodore. Software serialization and auto- 
matic loading options are available. And opera- 
tor training takes only ten minutes. How much 
more profitable would you be with superior 
production efficiency?

The Linking Process. If you try to execute the CTTEST. CODE file 
immediately after compilation, the Pascal system will issue this error 
message: 

Must L(ink first 

This situation occurs because the compiler does not automatically merge 
the object code for CharTools into that for CTTest (although life might 
be much simpler if it did). Instead, you must use a special utility pro- 
gram, the Linker, to combine the two into an executable code file. 

To invoke the Linker, press the L key when you see the system's 
main prompt line. The Linker will ask you to supply a series of file 
names, indicating the files that contain the object code to be merged. 
Finally, it will ask you to specify the name of an output file, into which 
it will deposit the merged (and presumably executable) object code. Here 
is the dialogue that your Pathfinder had with the Apple III Linker in 
order to merge the CTTest client program with the UNIT CharTools:

Lib file? return 
Map file? return 
Reading CTTEST 
Reading CHARTOOL 
Output file? CTA.CODE return 
Linking CHARTOOL # 7 
Linking CTTEST # 1 

The Apple II Linker is so close to the Apple HI version that you may 
consider this dialogue as representative of them both. Note that the user's 
responses to the Linker must all end with a tap of the return key, as noted 
in italics. 

The Host file is the focus of the linking process. It is object code that 
relies on outside resources that must be linked to it in order to produce an 
executable code file. In this case, the Host is CTTest, contained in the 
file CTTEST.CODE. The code in a Host file may be linked to code from 
one or more Lib files. The Linker wiU continue to ask for a Lib file until 
you respond to its request by pressing only the return key. In our exam- 
ple, the only Lib file necessary was CHARTOOLS.CODE. 

Notice that, in specifying the Host file and Lib file, you do not have 
to include the .CODE suffix. The Linker seems to append the suffix 
automatically. In truth, the Linker first tries to open files named 
CTTEST and CHARTOOLS without appending any suffixes. Since no 
such files exist, this strategy fails. The Linker then appends the .CODE 
suffix to each file name and tries again, this time successfully. Note that 
the Linker reports the name actually used in opening each file. 

The Map is a text fde, the contents of which summarize the results of 
the Linking process and illustrate the segmentation of the final object 
code. The information given in a link map is not relevant to the present 
discussion but will be covered in a future column. Usually, you will not 
want the Linker to produce a Map file. To dispense with it, as was done 
in the example, press only the return key when the Linker asks for a Map 
file name. 

Once you have specified the Host, Lib, and Map file names, the 
Linker examines the Host, then searches the Lib files for the UNITs or 
other modules that the Host code requires in order to be complete. In the 
example dialogue, this process was indicated by the Reading CTTEST 
and Reading CHARTOOL output messages. 

Finally, you are asked to specify an Output file. The Linker will 
deposit the linked object code in the file you name. Apple II owners 
should answer this question with care. If you want the destination to be a 
code file, you must include the .CODE suffix in the Output file name. 
For instance, if you answer CT to this input prompt, the Apple n (ver- 
sion 1.1) Linker will create a file named CT, then fdl it with linked ob- 
ject code. The only way to produce a file named CT.CODE is to respond 
to the prompt for an output file with the complete file name CT.CODE. 
Apple in owners should note that their version of the Linker automatical- 
ly appends .CODE to the output file name if that suffix isn't already pres- 
ent. (To defeat this behavior, end the output file name with a period. 
The Linker will remove the period ft-om the file name but add no suffix.) 

Linked output was directed to the file CTA.CODE in the example, 
because you wUl soon need the incomplete object code for another ex- 
periment. However, you might just as easily tell the Linker to replace the 
incomplete object code with the executable version, by specifying 
CTTEST.CODE as the output file name. 

As soon as it knows where to put the linked code, the Linker can pro- 
ceed to merge all of the pieces of a program together. All library routines 
are linked first, then the client's main program body. This is indicated, in 
our example, by the messages "Linking CHARTOOL #7," and "Link- 
ing CTTEST #1." Notice that, in both the "Reading" and "Linking" 
messages, the UNIT name, CharTools, was truncated to a length of eight 
characters. This reflects the fact that the Pascal compiler itself 
recognizes only the first eight characters of any identifier. Throughout 
compilation, linkage, and execution, the system deals with "UNIT Char- 
Tool," not CharTools! 

Execution! The CTTest program was designed to help you measure 
the execution speed of several of the CharTools routines, given 
"favorable" and "unfavorable" parameters to each. Have a stopwatch 
ready and start it as soon as you press the return key to begin a particular 
test. Stop the watch as soon as you hear the beep that indicates the con- 
clusion of a test. The number of loop repetitions has been chosen so that 
each test will take several seconds, rendering the results acceptably 
precise despite reasonable variations in your reaction time. Figure 2 lists

COMPRESS/EXPAND 

A MUST FOR ANY SERIOUS PROGRAMMER 

Most Apple* picture files take up to 34 
disk sectors of storage. This limits the 
number of pictures that can be saved on 
one disk. The SANSOFT PLUS COMPRESS/ 
EXPAND system allows you to process any 
standard picture file and compress it into 
a much smaller file that requires less disk 
space. Some pictures can be compressed by 
as much as 90% requiring only a few sec- 
tors depending on picture complexity. Since 
less sectors are used. Pictures load faster 
requiring less disk time. A small routine 
requiring less than 256 words can be load- 
ed into anyone of several locations and be 
called from your programs allowing amaz-

Figure 2. Execution times for certain CharTools (v 1 .0) subroutines (all times 
listed in seconds). 

Modifying a UNIT. Several of CharTools's subroutines use SET- 
constructor expressions within tests for SET inclusion. You may wonder 
how efficient this method is. Take it from your Pathfinder that, where 
SET operators are used, they execute much more quickly than com- 
parable comparison-based expressions. However, we might be able to 
tune these routines for even faster performance by replacing SET- 
constructors with precalculated SET variables. We have already seen 
that the values of SET-constructors are computed during execution, in 
much the same way as arithmetic expressions are. It seems reasonable to 
assume that we might assign fixed values to a small group of SET 
variables that are private to CharTools and refer to them in the bodies of 
the public subroutines. Since the "Char SET" values would be com- 
puted only once, some execution time should be gained. 

Listing 3 shows a new version of CharTools that has been modified 
according to our scheme. Note the addition of the private variables, A

and AN, as well as the "initialization body" at the bottom of the UNIT. 
A and AN cannot be accessed by any client; only CharTools knows 
anything about them. These variables also exist independently of any 
client. Throughout the execution of a client, the values contained by 
these variables will remain unchanged unless and until reset by code 
within CharTools. 

The "initialization body" in the new CharTools replaces the solitary 
END keyword that had marked the end of the original UNIT. When the 
client program is executed, this body of code will be executed before any 
client code. Thus, it is a perfect means for initializing a UNIT'S private 
variables. 

Probably the most important thing about the new CharTools is that its 
INTERFACE is virtually identical to that of its predecessor. Only the 
commentary varies between the two INTERFACE sections, and that 
amounts to no practical difference at all. Indeed, the Pascal compiler will 
view the pair as identical twins, since it ignores any comments that are 
not compiler directives anyway. 

Save the source text of the new CharTools in a file named NChar- 
Tools so that you will still have the original for future use. Then, compile 
the new file. You may go ahead and link NCHARTOOLS.CODE direct- 
ly to CTTEST.CODE, even though the $U instruction in CTTest's 
source implies that the CharTools UNIT is to be found in CHAR- 
TOOLS. CODE. This trick is possible only because the names and IN- 
TERFACES of the two UNITs are functionally identical. Put the linked 
code in the file CTB.CODE and execute it. 

Executing a CTTest that uses the new version of CharTools yields the 
curious results shown in figure 3. The old CharTools appears to be 
significantly faster than the new! Even your Pathfinder was amazed to 
find that using the value of a SET-constructor (which, presumably, is 
recomputed every time the constructor is referenced) is actually quicker 
than reading the preset value of an unvarying SET variable.

For Those Who Don't Like Vanilla. One of the most important 
criticisms of the Apple Pascal system is that the user must work with 
(and understand the operation of) too many different system components 
in order to produce even a simple program. This situation is only ag- 
gravated once you begin to create and employ UNITs, for then you must 
learn to use yet another part of the system, the Linker. Whenever you 
recompile a UNIT'S client you must also relink the object code that the 
compiler produces before the system will allow you to execute it. If you 
recompile a UNIT, you must, at the very least, relink each of its PRO- 
GRAM clients. (Of course, whenever the INTERFACE part of a UNIT 
changes, you must also recompile all clients.) More than one program- 
mer has slammed clenched fist to tabletop at the frustrating necessity of 
invoking the Linker so often. Fortunately, several of these programmers 
happened to be the designers of Apple Pascal! To alleviate the problem, 
they created a second kind of package— an INTRINSIC UNIT— that may 
reside in a central system "library file" and that may be linked to its 
client by the Pascal system automatically at execution time. To explore 
the advantages and disadvantages of INTRINSIC UNITs, as well as 
study a few of the subder aspects of "regular" UNITs, don't miss next

Why are some of the most respected authorities in 
the field of software saying all these nice things about 
PIE:Writer™? The answer is easy. 
Easy to Learn. Easy to Use. 
Part of the reason that PIE:Writer is the top ranked 
word processor is that it's just plain simple to run. 
In fact, you can use it as soon as you get it home. 
To write a letter, for instance, just (a) load the program, 
(b) type the letter 'E', and (c) write your letter. Then, 
(d) type 'F' to enter the print mode for either screen or 
paper and you're ready to print. You'll get a perfectly 
typed, spaced and formatted letter. Now what coula 
be easier than that? 

Powerful Features. 

Don't confuse our use of the word simple with unso- 
phisticated. PIE:Writer offers features and capabilities 
far beyond any other word processing programs for 
microcomputers. And that goes for most of the dedi- 
cated word processors as well. Here are just a few:

' 'John, this is Ken. Go long a round lot ofGBX common for me at the 
market. " 

What did I just do? I told my stockbroker to purchase one hundred 
shares (a round lot) of GBX common stock for me at the going market 
price. Why common stock? Because it's the most popular fluid form of 
individual investment in the world. 

A share of common stock may cost less than five cents or more than 
fifty dollars. Common stocks are like people— each has its own per- 
sonality, good points, and bad points. When it comes to dealing with 
common stocks, the trick is to decide which ones we want to hang 
around with. 

Stock Talk. Stocks don't jump out at you and say, "Hello. Buy me 
and we'll make lots of money together." The way to identify stocks 
worth investing in is by reading about them, about the market, and about 
general business conditions. Once you've done some research, you'll be 
in a position to find stocks that look good to you, analyze them, and, if 
you still like them, buy them. 

One way to get started is to establish a relationship with a full-service 
broker. Full-service brokers like Merrill Lynch, Prudential-Bache, 
Shearson/ American Express, and others have large comprehensive 
research departments that do nothing but analyze stock after stock, in- 
dustry after industry. When they find something they like, they issue a 
recommendation. Stockbrokers at any full-service house will be pleased 
to send you copies of their research reports. These reports offer a good 
means of getting a handle on the market, and they're free. 

Of course, you don't have to follow the research report recommen- 
dations. (If the people who wrote them were always right, they'd be 
slurping up Pina Coladas in some tropical paradise.) But research 
reports will give you a rough idea as to which industries in the market are 
hot and which are cold. For example, when oU was in short supply, oil 
stocks were booming. Then when the oil glut started, oil stock prices 
pluinmeted. 

This action-reaction brings us to an important point: What makes 
stocks go up and down? Good question— if we could know that with 100 
percent certainty, we'd all be inhaling Pina Coladas by now. 

Economic events, such as interest rate changes and inflation, have an 
impact on stock prices. If the news is bad— if, say, interest rates are go- 
ing up to 50 percent, stock prices will probably fall. If the news is good, 
stock prices will probably rise. 

Financial news and reports also affect stock prices. If Rinky Dink 
Products has had an exceptional year, the price of its stock will probably 
rise; if the company has had a bad year, prices will probably fall. 

Why "probably" rise or fall? Elecause emotion also plays a big part 
in the stock market. Remember, the stock market is an auction market in 
which prices are determined by bidding. Someone who wants a stock 
badly enough is very likely to be wiling to pay more for it than it's really 
wortfi. In fact, people have been known to buy stocks for the same reason 
that they bet on a particular horse: the name. Human beings are funny 
animals. When they want to do something badly enough, all the logic and 
reasoning in the world doesn't matter; they still do exactly what 
they want. 

Let's assume that we're in one of our more rational moods, and that 
today isn't the day we want to bet half our life savings on a company just 
because we liked the television commercials it ran during the Sunday 



night movie. How can we decide whether or not we want to buy this 
company's stock and whether it's worth the asking price? 

How we arrive at our answer will depend on our orientation. In this 
article, we'll discuss the rudiments of how to analyze a stock fundamen- 
tally; next time, we'll analyze a stock from a technical perspective. The 
exact outcome of either analysis depends on what we focus on. Fun- 
damental analysis and technical analysis don't always agree or disagree; 
rather, they reveal different things. It's up to you to decide which to bet 
your money on. 

Weighing Widgets. Assume that we've just finished reading a 
research report from the prestigious brokerage firm of Risk, Rate, and 
Reward. The report has piqued our interest in the widget business, and 
we are considering making an investment. The widget business seems to 
have good prospects for growth, and our hope is that stock in a company 
that manufactures widgets will increase in value as the demand for 
widgets grows. 

The first part of our analysis centers on who is in the widget business. 
We know the names of some of the big competitors, such as American

Widget, Amalgamated Widget, and Acme Widget. But there may be 
other companies whose names we don't know that could be good invest- 
ments. One way to find out who the other major competitors are is to ask 
the companies you already know about. 

All publicly held corporations must file a report called a lOK with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A lOK is a company's an- 
nual report with some additional information that's required by the SEC. 
In a lOK, a company's managers tell who they feel their competition is. 
Some libraries have lOKs on microfilm. If your local library doesn't, 
call or write the companies you're interested in and ask for copies of 
their lOKs; they'll be glad to send this information to you. 

Another way to find out who's who in a specific industry is to use a 
publication known as a corporate register. Businesses are classified and 
listed by SIC, or Standard Industrial Code. To learn to use a corporate 
register and SIC codes, ask your local librarian. 

Once you've gathered a list of companies, you're ready to begin 
research and analysis. Go to the library (or stay there if you're there 
already) and find the Standard and Poor's stock reports. 

Standard and Poor's compiles statistics on virtually every publicly 
owned company in the United States. Each report contains a brief 
description of the company's recent history, including important finan- 
cial information and news items. It's possible to get a great deal of finan- 
cial information from annual reports, but the information from stock 
reports is more concise and easier to digest. 

There are three different sets of Standard and Poor's Stock Reports: 
one for the New York Stock Exchange, one for the American, and one 
for the over-the-counter and regional exchanges. To find a stock, you'll 
need to know where it's listed or traded. 

The figure on the opposite page is a reproduction of the Standard and 
Poor's stock report for Apple Computer, which trades over the counter. 
Let's take some time to go over the report to see what we can learn 
from it. 

Each stock traded in the United States has a unique stock symbol. 
Sometimes a symbol looks or sounds like the company name, sometimes 
it does not. The NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers 
Automated Quotations System) symbol for Apple Computer is AAPL. 
To get the price of Apple stock from a quote database, we'd use that 
symbol. 

The price for one share of Apple Computer stock on March 12, 1983, 
was 41%. The stock's high between January 3 and March 23, 1983 (the 
date this report was issued), was 48% and its low during this period was 
27 Va . Does this range tell us anything significant? Had the stock market 
been stable, it would mean that we could assume that Apple's common 
stock flucmates a great deal. But the other reading we've done tells us 
that we have a bull market, a market that's going up. It appears that Ap- 
ple went up with the rest of the market. Had Apple stock gone down, it 
would have indicated either that the company was contracyclical (react- 
ing opposite to the rest of the market) or that something was wrong. 

Apple's P-E ratio (price-earnings ratio) was 34 on March 23. Price- 
earnings ratios are computed by dividing the stock price by the com- 
pany's earnings per share. The higher the P-E, the more speculative the 
stock. Earnings are used to pay dividends and to fund growth. The lower 
a company's earnings, the lower its dividends, which probably means 
there's been little growth. That's true unless the market is a new one, 
such as genetic engineering, where current growth is financed by other 
sources, such as venture capital. 

Stylish Investing. We can see that Apple is not paying a dividend. 
Some stocks pay dividends, while others don't. This doesn't make one 
stock better than the other. The stock you choose should reflect your per- 
sonal investment style. If you're looking for cash flow from a security, 
you'll look for a stock that pays dividends. If you're looking for a stock 
with a high probability of capital gains — that is, a stock that is likely to 
increase in value much faster than the rest of the market— you'll want a 
stock that pays low dividends or none at all. When a company's board of 
directors decides to pay low dividends or none, that generally means one 
of two things — the company is using all of its earnings to grow (a good 
sign) or there's no money (a bad sign). Make sure you know the situation 
before you buy. 

A stock that has no dividend has no yield. Yield can be equated to in- 
terest earned on savings deposits. A common formula that can be used to 
find a stock's yield is the yearly dividend divided by the stock's price. 
For example, if Rinky Dink Industries pays a yearly dividend of $1 and

OCTOBER 1983 



its stock price is $10, its yield is 10 percent. The question you're faced 
with is, "Am I better off putting my money in a nonrisk savings account 
and earning 7 or 8 percent (by today's rates) or is an 1 1 percent rate from 
a security that can go up and down worth the risk?" 

Just by reading the very top line of the stock report, we've learned 
about Apple's volatility, its dividend policy, and its P-E ratio. In other 
words, its history. This information is usually enough to give us a feeling 
for a stock and the way it behaves. But it's not enough to base an invest- 
ment decision on. We need to learn more about the company, its prod- 
ucts, and its prospects— after all, we can't make money on past perform- 
ance, only on future performance. 

The stock report summary tells us what business a company is in and 
what significant events may be about to happen in connection with it. 
Remember a little earlier when we mentioned emotion as a factor that 
affects stock prices? Let's consider an example. Say you read some- 
where that Apple Computer has developed a $5,000 personal computer 
system that offers the same power as a $6 million supercomputer. 
What effect do you think this development would have on the price of 
Apple stock? It might just go up to $5,000 a share. The trick is to be one 
of the first to find out about a new development, or an impending 
disaster. If you can manage that, then you can ride the wave up or down, 
making money along the way. (To make money in a bear market, or in a 
market that's falling, you'd sell short; we'll discuss this technique in a 
subsequent column.) 

Research and reading can help you be "in early" on a stock, but 
don't be too early. If your Uncle Fred heard from his bowling buddy that 
his employer, Rinky Dink, is going to announce a new, important prod- 
uct and that he should buy stock in the company, do not let him. And 
don't you buy it either. This type of information is called "insider infor- 
mation" and it's illegal to buy or sell securities based on this knowledge. 

The current outlook section tells us what can be expected in the near 
future. The revenue section shows us a thirteen- week comparison of 
revenue (sales) over the last few years. As you can see, Apple is grow- 
ing, and that's a good sign. As a matter of fact, the company has grown 
at an astronomical rate over the last few years. Looking at the figure 
under "Per Share Data($)" we see that during 1980 and 1981 Apple's 
highs were very close but the lows were not. Danger sign. If a company 



is growing rapidly and its stock price is not rising rapidly, that means the 
stock price already reflects the investment community's expectations 
about the company. 

Common share earnings show what amount of earnings per share is 
supporting a stock's price. There are many ways of using this number, 
but the most common is to estimate dividends, if there were any. The I 
payout ratio in the Per Share Data section shows what percentage of \ 
earnings per share is being paid out in dividends; Apple's says nil 
because Apple isn't paying any dividends. 

Historical Dink. Assuming that Rinky Dink earned $2 per share and 
paid out $1, the company's payout ratio is 50 percent. To guesstimate 
what a corporation will pay in dividends, we can look at its historical ; 
payout ratio, find an average, and multiply that times current or esti- 
mated earnings. 

The income data section shows us important information dis- 
tilled from Apple's income statement. Standard and Poor's reprints the 
numbers that most investors are concerned with. From this chart we can 
find out the sales (of)erating revenues), operating income, capital expen- 
ditures, depreciation, interest expense, net income before taxes, and net 
income. These figures tell us a great deal about the stock and about the 
company. 

Sales figures show us whether a company is growing, stagnant, or 
shrinking. Obviously, unless we have some strange form of investment 
strategy (or we sell short), we are going to look for a company with 
growth potential. Growth signifies health. 

Operating income is the earnings of the corporation before such 
business expenses as salaries, general costs, administrative expenses, 
and interest charges have been deducted. Most investors do not find the 
figures for operating income, depreciation, or interest expense very 
significant. That's not to say that these figures aren't important; they are. 
It's just that most people don't know how to use them. Making effective 
use of this information requires understanding fully how an accountant 
constructs an income statement. Explaining how this is done would re- 
quire the rest of this month's issue and probably most of next month's. A 
better strategy for learning about income statements and about what these 
numbers mean is to read a book on accounting for nonaccountants. The , 
time and effort you spend learning will be well worth it in the long run.

Capital expenditures are what a corporation spends on its future. 
Buildings and equipment are examples of capital expenditures. The 
generally accepted theory is that the more a corporation spends, the bet- 
ter. The effective tax rate tells us how much of every dollar Apple earns 
goes to Uncle Sam. This figure is the opposite of capital expenditures; 
the lower it is, the better. Net income tells us how much profit Apple 
made, and percent net income of revenues shows us how much profit the 
company made and kept for each dollar of sales. 

"Great," you're probably saying to yourself. "Now I know how to 
read this stuff and what it means, but how do I use it? And what's Ap- 
ple's competition doing?" The only way to get answers to these ques- 
tions is to get the stock reports for Apple's competition and compare 
them to Apple's stock report. 

Balance sheet data gives us a snapshot of a company's financial 
posture at a given point in time. A balance sheet can be difficult to inter- 
pret. If you're unfamiliar with accounting terminology, it's a very good 
idea to buy a book on accounting for nonaccountants. 

Basically speaking, what you should be looking for in a balance sheet 
is a company that has a high return on assets, a small percentage of debt 
as a component of total capitalization (% LT Debt of Cap.), and a high 
current ratio. The higher the return on assets, the more a company is 
making for its size. The lower a company's debt, the less the company 
owes; the higher the current ratio, the more money the company has 
available to pay current bills (the more liquid it is). 

These are good rules of thumb, but they shouldn't be followed un- 
questioningly. Many companies that are good investments wouldn't look 
like good investments if you only analyzed them this way. The only real 
answer here is to force yourself to learn how to read and interpret the 
numbers. 

The remainder of the stock report provides a short history, called the 
business summary, along with dividend data, financing plans, and 
capitalization— how much money is owed (debt) and how many shares of 
stock there are and who owns them. It would not be an exaggeration to 
say that stock reports function as an investor's map, compass, and 
sextant. 



A great deal of the material we've just covered may be new to you, or 
it may be old hat. To succeed at picking stocks and making investment 
decisions, you'll need to be proficient at accounting, research, and finan- 
cial analysis. Common sense won't hurt either. 

Stocked Daily. Stock prices and companies change daily. Any stock 
report or profile you get from the library is dated. To stay on top of 
things, you must supplement these sheets with current information. This 
month's software review looks at the Personal Investor, a package 
designed to get current information for you from the Dow Jones 
News/Retrieval Service and to produce reports on your portfolio. 
The Personal Investor, by Richard Parker, PBL Corporation (Box 559, 
Wayzata, MN 55391; 612-473-8998). $145 (with Dow Jones contract; 
includes one hour free usage). 
Backup policy: copy able. 

System requirements: Apple II, II Plus, or He; one or two disk drives. 
Optional: D.C. Hayes Micromodem or Apple comm card; eighty- 
column printer. 

The Personal Investor would seem to embody the best of both 
worlds— it's an integrated stock retrieval and portfolio accounting 
package at a great price. This program doesn't have the same features 
and functions in its portfolio accounting module as Portfolio Master or 
the Stock Portfolio System, but for beginners, or for experienced in- 
vestors who want basic functionality at a reasonable price, the Personal 
Investor can't be beat. 

The publisher describes this program as a combination of an 
automated index card, storage box, calculator, pencil, eraser, and per- 
sonal assistant. The end result is a software package that will 
automatically log on to the Dow Jones News/Retrieval Service, fetch 
quotes, post the new prices to the securities in your portfolio, and 
prepare a series of reports to help you manage your holdings. 

The other major feature of the Personal Investor is a Dow Jones 
News/Retrieval terminal mode, which makes it convenient to use the non- 
quote services on the Dow Jones system, such as corporate news, earn- 
ings estimators, sports, and weather. 

In a single-drive system, the Personal Investor stores your portfolio

information on the program disk so that you don't have to swap disks; it 
can store a maximum of 80 stocks, 150 purchases, and 100 sales. If you 
have a two-drive system, you can store 300 stocks, 600 purchases, and 
500 sales per data disk. 

The centerpiece of the entire program is the add/change stocks 
screen. This screen is well designed, functional, and easy to use. It is 
through this screen that you inform the Personal Investor of your stock 
purchases, sales, splits on your stock, and dividends. 

All stocks you place in the portfolio are added via this screen. Each 
stock has its own record. The program can handle multiple purchases of 
the same stock; purchases are added as separate line items in the bottom 
half of the add/change screen. Dividend yields are calculated on both the 
current stock price and on the purchase price so that you can quickly see 
any variations. In addition, the date a stock trades without its dividend 
(the ex-dividend date) is recorded to help you time purchases or sales 
with dividend percent declarations. 

The add/change screen is also the window through which to view 
your stock records. You can page backward or forward through your 
portfolio to check the information stored on each security. Stocks are 
stored in the order you originally entered them. 

It's also possible to get quotes on stocks you don't own but are in- 
terested in following. This is done by adding the stock through the 
add/change screen without recording a purchase. Once you've done this, 
the Personal Investor will update the price every time you log on to Dow 
Jones but the program won't include the stock in your portfolio. To look 
at the stock quote of any of these securities, or quotes on any of your own 
stocks, use the quote screen. 

The quote screen displays the latest quotes fetched and stored by the 
Personal Investor. When you update, the program fetches the last price, 
the close of the day before, the current high and low prices, and the 
volume traded from Dow Jones. Then when you request a quote, the pro- 
gram retrieves this information from disk and displays it on your Apple 
monitor. The Personal Investor can also calculate and display a stock's 
net change in price and its current yield on this screen. 

The quotes screen is accessible from any of the three portfolio menus. 



To review a quote, enter the stock's symbol, which is displayed in the 
top portion of the screen, or page through the portfolio by pressing the 
return key. Information from the quote screen can be printed out. 

DJ Reports. The Personal Investor can also generate four reports 
from the information you enter via the add/change screen and the quotes 
you've retrieved from Dow Jones. These reports can be displayed on the 
Apple's monitor or printed out. (The printed reports and the on-screen 
reports are slightly different— the printed ones contain more infor- 
mation.) 

The program also provides a tax report, which is a record of your 
sales of stock. This tax report shows you whether the proceeds from the 
sale of a certain stock will be subject to short- or long-term taxation. The 
program computes the total short- and long-term profits, along with the 
overall total profit or loss on sales. 

The description and price review report lists all the stocks in your 
portfolio, with date of purchase, number of shares owned, price paid, 
and last price quoted. The commission, which is shown in the printed 
report, is calculated by the system; it is the difference between the 
number of shares purchased, multiplied by the purchase price, subtracted 
from the gross cost you entered through the add/change screen. 

The gain/loss report resembles the tax report. Whereas the tax report 
tells you the profit or loss on actual sales, the gain/loss report tells you 
the value of your portfolio based on the last updated prices. This report 
shows the value of your portfolio at particular points in time. The Per- 
sonal Investor deducts any taxes or commissions you paid when you pur- 
chased various securities, but it does not deduct the transaction charges 
you'll incur if you sell. The true value of your portfolio is the total gain 
or loss minus transaction fees. You can get an estimate of what these fees 
would be from your broker. 

The printed dividend report gives you the ex-dividend rate, the pro- 
jected quarterly dividend, the projected annual dividend, the yield of the 
stock based on the purchase price, and the yield of the stock based on the 
current price. (The on-screen version of the report omits the ex-dividend 
and quarterly dividend columns.) This report is very helpful; you can use 
it to synchronize your sales and purchases so that you succeed in taking 
advantage of dividends. 

Every one of the reports the Personal Investor produces is easy to 
read, well laid out, and very useful. 

The news terminal feature of the program resembles those of other 
news terminal packages and modules we've looked at, in that the system 
(when equipped with a D.C. Hayes Micromodem II) dials and logs on to 
Dow Jones automatically. But that's where the similarity ends. Dow 
Jones formats its information in eighty columns. The Personal Investor 
provides a series of commands that can be used to put the Apple in either 
forty- or eighty -column mode. If you stay in forty-column mode, the 
Dow Jones information wraps around the screen. If you place it in the 
Personal Investor's eighty-column mode, information stays in eighty- 
column format. The program also allows you to flip back and forth be- 
tween modes. 

The news terminal lacks a built-in buffer to store incoming informa- 
tion, so if you want to save information you must print it out. Unfor- 
tunately, having a printer on-line slows down the storage process. And 
the longer you have to stay on Dow Jones, the higher your bill will be. A 
preferable arrangement would have been to have a memory buffer, since 
memory can store information much faster than a printer can. 

The Personal Investor's "cursor calculator" allows you to multiply, 
divide, subtract, and add positive or negative percentages to any number 
you're entering into the program. So instead of doing your math on a 
calculator and then entering the results into your system, you can do 
everything from right within the program, saving you time and trouble. 

The program's editing routines are quite well done. Correcting a 
mistake is almost effortless. If you should exceed the program's storage 
limitation, you can summarize your transactions automatically in order 
to make additional storage space available. After you run the tax report, 
the program asks you if you want to summarize all of your transactions, 
clear your portfolio (at the end of a tax year), or leave the entries alone. 
If you elect to summarize the transactions, the program will carry for- 
ward your portfolio balances and delete the detail. 

The program documentation is excellent — it's clear, easy to read, and 
logically arranged. The error-trapping is outstanding; it seems to be im- 
possible to get the system to bomb or lose data. 

The Personal Investor is a pleasure to learn and use. Hi

A Visit with 
DOW JONES 



BY JOAHH LEW 



Route 1, which arrows along the edge of Princeton, New Jersey, is 
lined with corporate facilities set like plantation manors amid duck ponds 
and sculpted lawns. A long, curving driveway leads to one such struc- 
ture, half-hidden behind darkened glass. On the second floor, a spacious 
office suite provides a sofa for a relaxed and expansive executive. 

"That was pretty cheeky," admits Bill Dunn, president and publisher 
of the Dow Jones Information Services portion of Dow Jones, as he 
recalls the mission statement with a grin. 

A major reorganization of Dow Jones & Company in 1980 resulted in 
seven operating groups. ' 'Every group has to have a mission statement, ' ' 
says Dunn. "Ours basically was that we intend to be the largest elec- 
tronic publisher and distributor of business and financial information. 
Three years ago no one else was saying anything, so we thought why not 
just say we're the largest and try to be the best until somebody else can 
demonstrate that we have no reason to be in this marketplace." 

Three years ago the Dow Jones News/Retrieval Service boasted ten 
thousand subscribers. By the end of this year, subscriptions to its twenty- 
two databases— which now encompass an encyclopedia, sports, world 
news, weather, movie reviews, and a shop-at-home service as well as 
business and financial information— are expected to top one hundred ten 
thousand. 

Durm wouldn't be surprised by a sometime-in-the-ftiture subscription 
base of ten million. "It sounds silly now," he concedes, "as sUly as if in 
1936 somebody had said the Journal would someday have two million 
subscribers. 

"In 1936 no one was buying stocks and my dad was carrying a 
signboard in Des Moines, Iowa, selling frankfurters. So who's going to 
be reading the Wall Street Journal then?" 

The analogy is probably not lost on far-sighted futurists, but the 
whole concept of electronic publishing would undoubtedly be wondrous 
indeed to three reporters named Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and 
Charles Bergstresser. 

It was in 1882 that they formed Dow Jones & Company, the company 
part consisting of the multisyllabic Bergstresser whose name apparendy 
lacked letterhead fitness. Theirs was a fairly straightforward operation, 
with Jones editing stories submitted by Dow and Bergstresser and scribes 
handwriting one-page bulletins delivered to Wall Street subscribers by 
messengers. 

Refinements came rapidly. By 1883, the bulletins, called "flimsies," 
were summarized in a two-page publication called the "Customers' 
Afternoon Letter," which in 1889 became a four-page newspaper called 
the Wall Street Journal. 

Delivery by horse and buggy, while dependable, was slow. For in- 
creased speed, the company initiated the Dow Jones News Service, 
operating over telegraph wires and employing the latest technology: a

printing device driven by ninety-six-pound clock weights requiring 
winding every half hour. It was called a "ticker." 

The broadtape, so named to distinguish it from the narrow tape that 
carried stock quotations, carried business and financial news. With the 
advent of electricity, the clock weights became museum pieces and 
technological improvements continued. New, high-speed tickers in- 
augurated in New York in 1931 were capable of receiving sixty-five 
words a minute. 

By 1964, Dow Jones had news-ticker clients in 676 U.S. cities and 
the service kept getting faster, despite the growing amount of informa- 
tion. In 1968, General Electric machines, developed for computer print- 
outs and capable of speeds of three hundred words a minute, were 
modified for the Dow Jones broadtape. By 1970, the printers probably 
could have been driven faster than they could be read, with offices con- 
ceivably inundated by ticker tape. 

"We started to get this perception of too much information," says 
Dunn, "yet we didn't want to restrict the flow. We just had to find a dif- 
ferent way to present it." 

For $25,000 a New Jersey research group, apparently subscribing to 
the dictum "If it ain't broke, don't fix it," advised against changing the 
system. But there was enough "gut reaction," according to Dunn, that 
the company decided to go ahead anyway. 

Enter Bunker Ramo, which had just completed a major quotes project 
for the National Association of Securities Dealers. In a 50-50 joint ven- 
ture. Bunker Ramo supplied technical and marketing skills, and in 1971 
Dow Jones pioneered electronic publishing with a news product 
developed from its ticker. Business and financial information, linked, 
categorized, and cross-indexed for Bunker Ramo's computer, was now 
subscriber-accessed from hard-wired terminals that Bunker Ramo and 
two other quotes vendors, Quotron and General Telephone and Elec- 
tronics, provided the brokerage community. 

Essentially, Dow Jones was a wholesaler to the three quotes vendors 
during the early seventies. "But the market was going south then," 
recalls Dunn and, with brokerages going out of business or con- 
solidating, Dow Jones was losing a ticker here and a quote-vending ter- 
minal there. So why not broaden the market and provide the service for 
corporate treasurers, controllers, and librarians? 

Bunker Ramo was hurting and didn't want further investments. "We 
knew then we were going to get divorced," says Dunn, "so we started 
figuring out what the value of the house was, the car, and we ended up 
negotiating a buy-out for all of the retrieval service." 

Now Dow Jones, as a retailer like Bunker Ramo, GTE, and Quotron, 
could have sold its service to the brokerage community directly. "But," 
says Dunn, the others having invested in marketing and terminals, "it 
would have been unfair of us to go in and say, well, here's Dow Jones 
and you can throw those bums out." Besides, that was a relatively small 
market and they were still wholesaling to the quotes vendors anyway. 

What they wanted was to sell their service to corporations, which 
could access it through time-sharing terminals. 

And then, says Dunn, "we got lucky." Along came Eve and Dow 
Jones was introduced to Apple. "We'd never heard of them," recalls 
Dunn. "They were making about seven hundred thousand dollars a year 
then, instead of over a billion. They were trying to sell hardware; we 
were a database purveyor, a reason why people would buy their 
hardware. We didn't have to sell hardware for our information to be 
valuable." 

A communications package and cooperative marketing arrangements 
with Apple in 1977 set the stage for similar agreements with Com- 
modore, Radio Shack, Atari, Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, 
Osborne, and IBM. "We couldn't do exclusives with anybody because 
we're a basic source of business and financial information in this coun- 
try," explains Dunn. "Some people think we're a monopoly; we con- 
sider ourselves a monopoly of excellence, but there's a fine line legally 
on restricting basic information from the public." 

Now, with business and financial news on-line, what about stock 
quotes? Associated Press files created for newspaper publishers could 
be, with the interactive work necessary for linking personal computers 
back to the quote source, provided to subscribers. In 1979, Dow Jones, 
acting as a subcontractor for AP, added that service. The problem was 
that AP, essentially a nonprofit organization run by some fifteen hundred 
newspapers, wasn't measuring up. 



"The response rate was horrible," recalls Dunn, "and we were sell- 
ing in the name of Dow Jones. ' ' To protect that name with the service its 
customers expect, the company had to go into the quote business. A 
system was designed that brought information in from the various ex- 
changes, carefully edited for accuracy. "So Dow Jones was going to 
have a quote service," beams Dunn, "and, man, it was going to be 
fantastic." 

But a quote is a quote is a quote. How would a Dow Jones quote dif- 
fer from a Bunker Ramo or an AP quote? IBM opens, closes, and shows 
the same volume regardless of who reports it— unless one could analyze 
or otherwise manipulate various data with a little software, maybe 
something Apple could publish as the Dow Jones Portfolio Evaluator. 

With the reorganization in 1980, the Dow Jones Information Services 
became essentially an entrepreneurial group allowed to find its own way. 
Software development, independent marketing, and technical and 
editorial directions could be explored by old guard and young Turks with 
the new organization and more people. 

In July of 1980 Dick Levine left the Washington bureau of the Wall 
Street Journal, on which he'd worked for almost fifteen years, for a

nonexistent editorial department in the Princeton office. "I didn't know 
what to do and my bosses didn't know either," recalls Levine, from a 
clutter of tickers and terminals in the newsroom, now a beehive of activi- 
ty with one wall lost to a huge map of the world. 

One of his first requests was for a typewriter. "I didn't know 
what I was going to do with it," he says, "but I just felt better having 
it around." 

The first task, for which the typewriter was no help, was getting jour- 
nalists and computer people to speak the same language. "And jour- 
nalists had to be designers," adds Levine, "defining what we wanted to 
do. There were no rules, and no cookbook to look into for the recipe." 

And there wasn't a large pool of people with experience in the field. 
Levine hired one editor who'd spent a year preparing the Columbus Dis- 
patch for the CompuServe electronic information service and another 
who'd been technology editor for the New York Times. 

Now, three years later, the department consists of about thirty 
editors, database writers, copy readers, and news assistants. At any given 
moment, three people are "sort of monitoring the world," says Levine, 
seven days a week, in a roadside building that looks like a storefront 



compared to its next-door parent in black glass. But this is where the ac- 
tion is. 

News off the UPI wire is quickly edited, condensed, or rewritten, 
then formatted to fit CRT screens. With a push of a button, it's fed to 
mainframe computers in an adjoining room where it's made available to 
subscribers within minutes of its receipt on the UPI newswire. A 
technical department of some sixty people provides round-the-clock 
monitoring of the room full of Digital Equipment computers used for 
processing and a second, larger room, which looks for all the world like 
a Laundromat, full of IBM hard-disk storage. 

The initial emphasis was on adding databases valuable to the serious 
investor. By the end of 1980, the Media General Financial Services was 
on-line with detailed corporate financial information that by 1983 would 
include nearly thirty-two hundred companies and one hundred eighty in- 
dustries, with fifty-two statistical indicators such as revenue, earnings, 
dividends, and so forth. In 1981, seven more financial-services databases 
were introduced, ranging from the Corporate Earnings Estimator to 
transcripts of Wall Street Week. 

Twelve databases were added in 1982, including World Report.

^ O FTA I 1^ 



OCTOBER 1983 



From UPI, foreign and national news is selected, edited, and ranked by 
importance by News/Retrieval journalists so that subscribers can gain 
access to headlines, the World Report "front page," and some fifty 
stories a day, each averaging three "pages," or screens. 

"It's tough now to decide what databases to offer," says Levine. "In 
the beginning we went around knocking on doors." Now, of course, in- 
formation companies anxious to get on the Dow Jones service are knock- 
ing on their door. Hundreds of database proposals have been reviewed, 
but the selection process insists on both quality and added value. "We 
don't want our material simply to rehash what's in print," adds Levine. 
"If we can't add value to delivering news and information electronically, 
we don't do it." 

Internal resources are far from exhausted. There is still lots of 
material within Dow Jones that may yet find its way to a screen. The 
Wall Street Journal is publishing Asian and European editions with only 
limited portions available through News/Retrieval, and relatively small 
amounts of Barron 's are on-line. 

There are plans. In coming months the full text of the Wall Street 
Journal will be offered electronically, as will an economic dictionary. 
And because the basic language of business is English, Levine expects to 
see as much interest in News/Retrieval from foreign publishers as from 
American. "I fully expect our service to be international in scope," he 
says. Development work is currently proceeding on an arrangement 
with the leading Japanese news agency that will allow Dow Jones 
News/Retrieval to provide same-day coverage of the Japanese economy. 
Time differences will permit approximately forty Monday stories from 
Japan to be translated to colloquial English and presented on-line at 9:00 
a.m. Monday morning in New York. 

Sports and weather databases were added in 1981, with the realiza- 
tion that in-home delivery went to subscribers with interests other than 
business and financial. In 1982, movie reviews and the twenty-eight- 
thousand-article Academic American Encyclopedia went on-line. 

Grolier's encyclopedia, the first new one in ten years and designed 
from the outset for electronic access as well as print, is updated every six 



months. "It changes the nature of what an encyclopedia is," observes 
Levine. "It's not static anymore." It's a news tool, for one thing. When 
a brave dentist named Barney Clark volunteered for a polyurethane heart 
implantation, the story on News/Retrieval was cross-referenced to its en- 
cyclopedia's four-page article about the artificial heart. 

"We married the news item to the reference," says Levine, a 
dramatic instance illustrating his conviction that the whole of News/ 
Retrieval should be greater than the sum of its parts. 

When the Comp-U-Store shoppers' database was added in January 
1983, the staff of Dow Jones News/Retrieval were concerned about the 
appropriateness of their organization's name; shopping was the farthest 
they had gone yet from the service suggested by the name. 

Debates on name change ceased when marketing surveys revealed 
that the name now has recognition even by people who don't use on-line 
services. 

Director of marketing Tim Turner is more concerned with supporting 
the growing number of subscribers. The first means implemented was 
customer service. With some three hundred thousand calls this year, a 
staff of thirty was trained to answer questions about software and the 
News/Retrieval service on three 800 numbers from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 
p.m. EST, Monday through Friday, and 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Saturdays. I 

A long-term plan calls for off-loading high-use databases to specific 
geographical areas through the packet-switchers now in use: Tymnet, 
Telenet, Uninet, and Dow Jones's own DowNet, with nodes in Princeton i 
and soon in New York City. Dow Jones was the first private company ' 
licensed by the FCC to own and operate satellite earth stations, used for 
the Wall Street J ourrmVs, seventeen plants across the country and mainly 
at night. News/Retrieval will be using this large satellite communications 
system before the decade is out. 

But it's the software that more immediately serves subscribers, 
allowing users automatic log-on, access to all News/Retrieval databases, 
and extraction of specified financial data, with off-line charting, 
graphing, and other manipulations. The initial product line developed 
under the Dow Jones label consisted of three investment analysis soft-

ware programs, Market Analyzer, Market Microscope, and Market 
Manager, which were introduced to Apple users in September 1982. 
They were transported this year to the IBM pc along with a new pro- 
gram, the Dow Jones Reporter. 

Coming events include two packages presently under development 
and scheduled for release soon. One will permit users to manipulate 
News/Retrieval data with VisiCalc, Multiplan, or 1-2-3 spreadsheets, 
permitting individual creativity that the charting packages prohibit. 

"And," says a youthful Steve Bertges, product development man- 
ager and one of Dunn's young Turks, "we're real excited about a 
program that's going to let users go into the service with preformatted re- 
quests with a single command, a sort of personalized clipping service of 
what's happened to particular stocks, without having to rekey the stock 
symbols for each news item. " This package will perform a file search of 
the entire Dow Jones host, automatically paging through a stock's per- 
formance, estimated earnings, headlines, disclosure, or whatever has 
happened to that stock since the previous information request. 

Bertges is excited about the software. Turner about the expanded and 
specialized customer service department, Levine about new databases, 
and Dunn about everything. But there's another department, only six or 
seven people, headed by low-key, soft-spoken Skip Grossman. 

"We have interactive cable service in place in five cities," says 
Grossman, "and we've reached agreement with twelve operating com- 
panies, including eight of the thirteen largest cable operators in the coun- 
try, covering nearly thirty communities, with well over 1.25 million 
potential passengers." 

Because Dow Jones News/Retrieval over two-way cable lines is a 
flat-rate service, cable subscribers, according to Grossman, access the 
service from ten to thirty times more than computer users. "They don't 
worry about how much time the kids spend using the encyclopedia, ' ' he 
adds. "There's no issue of, good grief, how much is the bill going 
to be." 

While price schedules for computer access range from as much as 
$1 .20 a minute for financial information in prime time (but as low as thir- 



teen cents after 6:00 p.m. and on weekends), cable subscribers pay 
twenty-two dollars a month for unlimited access to the general news and 
information services and restricted access (evenings and weekends) to 
financial and business news, quotes, and Journal highlights. Around-the- 
clock access to everything is fifty dollars. 

Both rates include the rental fee for the keyboards that Dow Jones had 
constructed by RCA because there wasn't any off-the-shelf hardware. 

This bargain now being snapped up in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and 
Clearwater, Florida, plus Fort Worth, Texas, and suburbs of Houston 
and Dallas, will soon be available in Grosse Point and Dearborn, 
Michigan, as well as in some Boston suburbs. Other sites on the drawing 
board include Chicago, Saint Paul/Minneapolis, Tampa, Alexandria, 
Maryland's Montgomery County, half of Staten Island, and Orange 
County, California. 

But whatever happened to the plan to sell Dow Jones News/Retrieval 
to corporations? Well, that's gotten off the ground, too. "Fireman's 
Fund is using it," reports Tim Turner, "and Northwest Industries. Peat, 
Marwick and Mitchell's ninety-three offices have it at a corporate rate. 
J.C. Penney 's corporate computer is going to be hooked to ours. And 
Digital Equipment Corporation uses News/Retrieval to demonstrate the 
capabilities of their own equipment. 

"On one side of the ledger we're kind of bullish and egotistical, 
but it's humbling when you figure that two hundred fifty thousand 
subscribers is less than 4 percent of the readership of the Wall Street 
Journal. ' ' 

Humbling? Don't try to tell that to the people who write mission 
statements with hardly less immodesty than this ad for the Dow Jones 
wire service published November 14, 1898, in the Wall Street Journal: 

"Quick as a Flash! We give quotations, telegrams, cables, and all 
kinds of news affecting the markets. Page printers are the latest elec- 
tronic device. News carried by electricity printed by electricity. No 
banker or broker can well afford to be without our Financial News Serv- 
ice. Dow, Jones & Co." 

Pretty cheeky. Some things never change.

One company has sold more printers 
to this planet than anybody. 

Epson. 



By now, that shouldn't come as any surprise. 
After all, we invented digital printers for the 1964 
Tokyo Olympics. 

Since then, we've built more print mecha- 
nisms than the rest of the world combined. 
Including the world's smallest printers, the 
world's most reliable printers and the world's 
first disposable print head. 

And today we are proud — but not surprised 
— to say that the world's best selling printers 
for small computers 
have the Epson name 
right on the front. 

But the really 
amazing fact about 
Epson printers is this: 
they don't cost any 
more than other 
printers. In fact, they

frequently cost less. 

Here's how we got to be the world's best- 
selling printers: by building a quality product, by 
pricing it fairly and by standing behind it. That's 
the way we've done business for almost 20 years. 

Only one printer can claim to be "number one." 
And measured by popular acceptance, by techno- 
logical innovation, by honest-to-goodness value, 
not to mention sheer weight of numbers, that 
printer is Epson.

Mind Your 
Business 

BV PETER OLIVIERI 




Hello to all of you old and new Mind Your Business fans; welcome to 
another column chock-full of interesting and valuable information! 

For some time now, we've talked about compiling a list of useful 
utility programs that members of our Business User Group would appre- 
ciate knowing about. To date, however, there's been zero response to 
our requests for input. That's right, folks . . . zero response. Perhaps the 
explanation for this surprising turn of events lies in the fact that the 
meaning of the term "utility program" is unclear. To clarify, almost any 
piece of software that helps you in your day-to-day activities will qualify; 
a utility program might be a sorting program, a program that formats 
your own programs in a certain way before printing them, an envelope 
addresser, or a program that tells you how much free space remains on a 
disk. So let's go, folks; share your successes with your fellow B.U.G.s! 

Micro Modification? Most of us would agree that the microcom- 
puter was a great idea. We'd probably say that it serves us relatively well 
in the areas that we use it. Despite our positive feelings, it's also prob- 
ably true that most of us can think of ways we'd like to redesign certain 
aspects of the microcomputer to make it do an even better job of meeting 
our specific needs. 

One aspect of the Apple that we've talked about wishing we could re- 
design is the keyboard. Why, we've wondered, couldn't we make each 
key whatever we wanted it to be? That's now quite possible on the Apple 
He, which provides several programmable keys. But what if you don't 
have a lie and you see a need for programmable keys, or what if you own 
a He but you want more programmable keys— a whole keyboard worth? 

Well, when opportunity knocks, in steps an entrepreneur. There are 
now several vendors who offer separate programmable keyboards for the 
Apple. One such company is Creative Computer Peripherals, maker of 
the KeyWiz VIP, a user-programmable keyboard. While some computer 
users will think of a product like this as an unnecessary frill, others will 
deem it indispensable. 

The KeyWiz is one of those products that significandy increase the 
flexibility of your machine. It's about the size of your regular keyboard, 
and it attaches to the Apple by means of an interface card placed in an 
available slot. On the interface card is a wire that must be coimected to 
the Apple keyboard. This procedure is a simple one and shouldn't take 
more than about fifteen minutes, and the instructions for completing it 
are clear and concise. 

Once the hardware is connected, you have the equivalent of four ad- 
ditional keyboards for your computer. (By the way, hooking up the 
KeyWiz does not disable your Apple keyboard the way some keyboard 
attachments do.) 

The keyboard has thirty-one programmable keys. There are two 
other keys: One allows you to select one of four new keyboard designs, 
and the other is used in establishing what you want a given key on one of 
your new keyboards to represent. An LED light keeps you informed of 
which keyboard you're using. 

Essentially, here's how the setup works. You decide what each key 
on a new keyboard will represent. A single key can represent a letter of 
the alphabet, a VisiCalc conunand, or a complex word processing ma- 
neuver. Each key can be programmed to stand for as many as eight 
keystrokes. Thus, this is a product whose applications are limited only 
by your own creativity and imagination. 

By the way, despite how it may sound, "programming" a key is by 
no means a difficult task. You simply press P (for program) on the new 
keyboard, hold down the key you wish to be programmed, and then use 
your main keyboard to enter up to eight keystrokes that will be activated 
when the new key is pressed. When you're finished, just press the P key 
again; that's all there is to it. You can learn to use this product in as little 
as fifteen minutes. 



Actually, each keyboard has 62 programmable keys. The 31 keys can 
be used in combination with the shift key to produce another set of 3 1 keys. 
In other words, 248 programmable function keys are available to you that 
can be divided up any way you wish. You could set up sections of the key- 
board for different purposes— word processing, spreadsheets, database 
management, or whatever, and commands that once required several key- 
strokes would now require only one. 

If you do some programnung you might want to make each key a par- 
ticular word or command from the programming language you're using. 
Once things were set up, you'd press a single key for print, another for run, 
another for list. You could also create an adventure keyboard on which in- 
dividual keys represented the various directions, another key stood for in- 
ventory, yet another specified that you wished to take something, and so on. 

Several blank plastic templates that fit over the keys are supplied with 
the KeyWiz; these enable you to clearly label what conunand each key 
on each of your keyboards represents. 

There's no software component to the package and it doesn't interact 
with your disk drive at all. Instead, it's completely self-contained, allow- 
ing you to reprogram any key, at any time, with any character(s) you can 
type in from your keyboard. Once you've done the necessary "program- 
ming," you're ready to use your new keyboard with your favorite 
software. 

The memory that's used to remember the keyboards you create is 
nonvolatile; in other words, this memory is not erased when you shut off

your machine. Thus, once you've gone to the trouble to create a 
keyboard, it's there (stored on a chip in the hardware device) whenever 
you want it. And yet, you can change any key or keyboard at will. Essen- 
tially, this product never becomes obsolete because it may be 
reprogrammed for a new software system at any time. As new products 
become available, you can modify your keyboard to reflect the com- 
mands associated with them. 

A Big Plus. The real advantage to this device is that it makes using 
the computer easier. It really does begin to add that oft-sought-after 
dimension of user-friendliness. In addition, the documentation is well 
done— it's brief, clearly written, illustrated, and actually readable. 

The Key to the Key. KeyWiz VIP is not inexpensive; it retails for a 
little more than $400. However, it's an attachment that won't soon be ob- 
solete, and, seen from this perspective, its value becomes more apparent. 
It can certainly make it easier to do word processing, spreadsheet appli- 
cations, programming, repetitive data entry, and other tasks requiring 
extensive use of the keyboard. 

So give it some thought. In a future column, we'll look at a cus- 
tomized use of the KeyWiz VIP in some business application areas. In 
the meantime, be advised: If you try this product yourself, you'll prob- 
ably find it hard to put down. 

Not Another Checkbook Program. That's precisely correct- 
Money Street, the next product we'll look at, is not just another check- 
book program. Rather, it begins to resemble what we all wish checkbook 
programs were like. The reason checkbook-balancing programs have not 
found their way into this column before now is primarily that none have 
been very well designed. 

Money Street, from Computer Tax Service, is a complete checkbook 
fmancial system that will run on a 48K Apple n Plus, a lie, or an Apple 
in in emulation mode. Only one disk drive is required, but having two 
reduces the amount of time spent swapping disks. In describing this pro- 
gram, the important words are "financial system," since this program 
does more than simply track your checks and balance your checkbook. 
Let's look at some of the features Money Street offers. 

First of all, the program is easy to use; even inexperienced comput- 
erists can become quite familiar with it in less than half an hour. And 



both novices and more experienced computer users will appreciate the 
many error traps that have been incorporated into the program. 

Money Street allows you to handle an unlimited number of checking 
accounts. Checks and deposits can be sorted into business, personal, or 
tax categories you define (up to 100 categories are allowed), and year-to- 
date totals for 100 categories can be displayed. You can list a history of 
2,400 checkbook entries showing the running balance, and you can cre- 
ate audit trails sorted by payee, date, entry order, amount, check num- 
bers, uncleared items, or deposits. 

The program is fast — with a two-disk system, scanning through an 
electronic file of 1 ,000 checks takes about two minutes and finding a 
canceled check from among 2,400 requires about one minute. Year-to- 
date totals for business, office, and home accounting can be printed, as 
can a trial reconciliation statement showing starting balances, checks, 
and deposits. 

Money Street gives you what might be called a "real-time" database. 
As you add information about a particular category (for example, 
medical expenses), the year-to-date totals are calculated and displayed at 
the bottom of the screen; you see them instantly. You can also obtain an 
on-screen dictionary of all your category names. This dictionary contains 
all year-to-date totals, a count of items in each category, and subtotals for 
any categories you specify. 

Other features of note: The program accommodates credit card ac- 
counting and allows you to split entries between category codes. In ad- 
dition, it allows you to edit anything anytime. 

When your monthly bank statement arrives, you can check to see 
whether the bank's records reflect what actually took place in your ac- 
count. This allows you to keep close tabs on your deposits and checks— 
not a bad idea, since even banks have been known to make mistakes upon 
occasion. 

Money Street makes available fifteen ready-to-print reports; among 
these are reports listing information in terms of monthly activity, indi- 
vidual payee, deposit, uncleared checks or deposits, checks by particular 
category, and so on. 

Money Street is thorough, easy to use, well designed, and worth look- 
ing at. It is not without some limitations. You're allowed only 100 



ALGEBRA GOES ELECTRONIC! 




ALGEBRA ARCADE was created by math instructors 
and student-tested for four years. It's educational 
software that really works. 

Ten Algebroids on a coordinate system, the villainous 
Graph Gobbler and suddenly algebra is a 
game! Students enter in an algebraic equation and 
the resulting graph zaps the Algebroids and racks 
up points — but watch out for the Graph Gobbler! 
Collide with him and you lose points and up to three turns. 

The ALGEBRA ARCADE is challenging to math 
students of every skill level. Beginners enjoy 
playing with simple straight lines while math 
sophisticates can create complicated curves 
using the ten algebraic functions included in 
the game (sine, cosine, tangent, etc.). 

ALGEBRA ARCADE— educational software 
that brings algebra to electric life. 

ALGEBRA ARCADE is available for $49.95 
on the Apple II, IIPlus and lie, IBM PC, 
Atari 800 and Commodore 64.

tended accrual accounting. It will gather data for general ledgers, payroll 
accounting, and journals, in addition to keeping track of your checks. 

What Bugs B.U.G.s? Every now and then, members of our 
Business User Group register complaints. In the interest of sharing both 
good experiences and bad so that all may benefit, let's listen in. 

Bug One. John Howson of Chappaqua, New York, writes to com- 
ment on the Mind Your Business review of Micro/Terminal for the Ap- 
ple III. What concerns Howson is the product's limited capacity to deal 
with information downloaded from a commercial database (such as the 
Dow Jones News/Retrieval Service). Although the amount of material 
that can be downloaded is virtually unlimited, he can find no way to 
review the data (by running through it with the cursor) except by using 
the editor to reload the data back into RAM from a disk file. Unfortu- 
nately, the Micro/Terminal editor can handle only 200 lines of text, and 
since Dow Jones and other programs often use double and triple spacing 
and forty -column lines, 200 lines isn't all that much. Howson wonders if 
any B.U.G.s who use this product have come up with any ideas, tricks, 
or utilities to make the whole process easier. 

Bug Two. Howson also has some feelings to share about Word Jug- 
gler III. He wishes that the software had a line-counting device that 
would enable the viewer to know the number of lines on each page as 
soon as the first portion of each page is displayed. He feels that this in- 
formation is important to have when you're attempting to position text 
vertically on the page for proper appearance. In addition, Howson 
reports he doesn't rate the documentation as highly as the Mind Your 
Business review did. His biggest complaint is that, although the tutorial 
sessions covered a lot of ground, nowhere in the manual was there any 
clear explanation of the real parameters of many of the functions. 
Rather, there are general references to lots of things, and readers must 
figure out the parameters for themselves. He feels that more specific ex- 
planations would have made for a more "user-friendly" manual. 

Bug Three. But three isn't really a bug; it's a comment on Word Jug- 



gler that fits in rather well at this point. David Bolduc of Austin, Texas, 
writes to say how much he likes Word Juggler. Bolduc, who has used 
Apple Writer III and a number of Apple II word processing packages, 
praises Word Juggler's documentation, packaging, data-file merge capa- 
bility, display modes, and user template. He feels that the program is 
easy to learn, easy to use, and very powerful. He also appreciates the 
way it interfaces with Mail List Manager and feels that the support given 
by Quark Engineering has been exceptional . 

B.U.G. Request for Help— Two Possible Answers to One Ques- 
tion. R.H. Urban of Ridgefield, Connecticut, has some helpful sug- 
gestions for Harding Rees. Rees had been having trouble getting a single 
line feed when using the Epson with Quick File III and VisiCalc III. 

According to Urban, the difficulty probably stems from the setting of 
the DIP switch on Rees's printer that controls line feeds; it is probably 
set to "on." Since the software Rees is using normally sends line feeds, 
the redundancy causes a problem. Another possible source of the prob- 
lem is the printer interface card. Most Epson printers have a parallel in- 
terface card. It's possible that the card on Rees's Epson has a "hard" 
switch that is generating a line feed in addition to the one being generated 
by software. 

In either case, the problem is not specifically related to combining the 
Epson and these two software packages. Urban has been using both 
packages with his Epson MX-80 and the Apple III Universal Parallel In- 
terface Card, and he has not had a problem with extra line feeds. The 
Apple HI UPIC card has a switch that is set to auto. It works properly 
with an extensive array of Apple III software and suppresses double line 
feeds when software is being used. 

Help One. Steve Kipperman, a San Francisco B.U.G. , would like to 
interface his Apple with his new IBM DisplayWriter and would like to 
know what hardware and software might be most appropriate for accom- 
plishing the task. Moreover, Kipperman would be pleased to hear of 
ways of enabling the DisplayWriter to communicate with other word 
processors. Can a fellow B.U.G. provide some guidance here? 

Help Two. Evans Harrell of Marietta, Georgia, has an Apple II Plus 
with a Videx 16K expansion card. He is attempting to interface Apple 
Writer II with an Okidata 92 Microline printer and is running into some

difficulty. (He has had similar problems getting Super-Text 40/80 to 
function with his printer.) The main problem is that Harrell can't seem to 
find a way to embed the ASCII character strings and the control com- 
mands the Microline printer requires in text. 

Also, Harrell finds that he must initialize with control-V control-I 
80n control-V in order to get a printout wider than forty columns. If he 
uses a capital N as the initialization commaricl suffix, he gets seventeen 
characters per inch printed, whereas if he uses a lower-case n, he gets ten 
characters per inch. If he attempts to bury the control-I SON in the text, 
he can't return to ten characters per inch by means of control-V control-I 
80n control-V. Neither of these command sequences seems to relate to 
the Okidata Microline 92 instruction book. 

In Apple Writer II, the command for continuous underscore is the 
backslash (one to start and another to stop). When Harrell attempts to use 
this command he gets an underscore consisting of dashes, not a con- 
tinuous underscore. He is also having trouble getting the superscript and 
subscript functions to work. 

C'mon, all you talented B.U.G. members; let's help this guy out. Do 
your good deed for the day; write now. 

Help Three. Nelson Capes of Shreview, Minnesota, has an unusual 
question for B.U.G. members. He owns a very early model Apple III 
(serial number 263) that he bought in 1978. Now he's thinking about 
upgrading to a lie or a Lisa. About six months ago, a local Apple dealer 
suggested that his Apple might be worth more than he paid for it, because 
it might be a collector's item. No one else seems to know whether this 
is the case. While the current drop in price for the Apple HI makes it 
difficult to believe that this machine is worth a lot. Capes would hate to 
let it go for too low a price. Any suggestions? 

User Update. Jim Pittman, Jr., of Albuquerque, New Mexico, has 
written to this column once before. Now he's offerings update on his 
experiences with a few products. First of all, he uses Super-Text Profes- 
sional and is extremely pleased in nearly every way. (There are some 
drawbacks, such as the fact that the program doesn't take advantage of 
an installed 16K card, does not support proportional or bidirectional print- 
ing, and has a fairly small workspace, but these matters are all 



minor to this satisfied customer. 

Pittman bought his Apple and the original Super-Text in May 1980 
and had some difficulty learning the original version, perhaps because 
he was a new computer user at that time. He has now bought every new 
version of Super-Text released so far and feels that each new version has 
retained the positive features of earUer versions while adding enhancements 
and doing away with negative features. He feels that he might be prej- 
udiced in favor of Super-Text Professional because he has developed 
along with it. Nonetheless, he feels that this program offers many 
features that other word processors lack. 

Pittman recommends that Super-Text users purchase a program called 
Lexicom from MicroSparc. This program quickly translates between Apple 
3.3 DOS text files and Super-Text binary files. He also believes that it's 
essential for Apple owners to have a lower-case adapter. He has used the 
Dan Paymar adapter successfully but now has the Videx Keyboard and 
Display Enhancer and is quite pleased with the extra capabilities it pro- 
vides. He does mention one annoying feature: Hitting the control key puts 
you into upper-case lock mode but there's no indication of this on-screen. 
Pittman put in a call to Videx and was able to obtain information on how 
to disable this feature. 

One More Minute. Many readers have commented on the usefulness 
of the Minute Manual, designed to clarify how to use the Epson with a 
word processing program. MinuteWare recently aimounced the availa- 
bility of a Minute Manual for DB Master. In keeping with the original 
concept for these manuals, it is readable, informative, and concise. DB 
Master is an excellent program, but its manual is difficult to master. 
Perhaps this new publication will help some older and new users of the 
program. Dl

LOCK-IT-UP 

DISKETTE COPY-PROTECTION 
AND DUPLICATION SYSTEMS 
FOR THE APPLE COMPUTER 

The Lock-lt-Up systems are sophisticated, menu driven 
copy-protection and duplication utilities for the Apple II 
Computer. They feature several levels of protection which 
make standard diskettes uncopyable by even the most 
sophisticated nibble copy programs currently available. 

• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Data files can be loaded and/or saved to either the protected diskette 
or an unprotected diskette. 

• Memory will be cleared and the disk will reboot if the reset key is 
pushed. 

• The copying systems support up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data-verification is optional during copy. 

• Sequential serial numbers are assigned to each diskette produced by 
the system 

• Master diskettes created with the system contain an I.D. stamp that 
you select. The I.D. stamp must be correctly specified before any 
diskettes can be duplicated. This prevents other Lock-lt-Up owners 
from copying your diskettes. 

• Extensive support is provided should you have any problems or 
special needs. 

• Our system is supported by numerous disk copying services should 
you need a large quantity of diskettes duplicated. 

Either system is available for $225, which includes three diskettes, an 
informative manual, and a non-exclusive license to copy as many 
diskettes as needed.

The keys to success. 

Whether you have a small re- 
tail company, manage a service 
agency or run a cattle ranch, you 
have to do something else well 
to build a business — manage 
money. 

You've got to analyze cash 
flow, see trends and forecast 
profitability in a time and cost 
effective manner. 

The right fit. 

A computerized account 
ing system makes sense, 
but finding the right soft- 
ware is important. The 
"home checkbook" pro- 
grams are easy to use but 
they don't have the ad- 
vanced reporting capabilities you need. And many 
small businesses just don't need the complexity or 
the cost of the modular systems. 

Practical Accountant™ is a single entry, small busi- 
ness accounting program that comes complete in one 
package. It's friendly enough to balance your check- 
book, yet sophisticated enough to give you the kind of 
money management information you need for a suc- 
cessful business. 

We could have called it 
"Accounting Made Easy. " 

Practical Accountant is designed around funda- 
mental accounting procedures. Even if you don't 
know much about accounting it is an ideal program. 

The manual explains basic accounting terminology 
and provides a comprehensive tutorial. It will take you 
step-by-step through the process of setting up a com- 
plete, single entry accounting system you can begin 
using right away. 



Ifs quick to learn and 
convenient to use. 

The program guides you with 
easy-to-use menus and provides 
on the screen prompting. Practi- 
cal Accountant even does some 
of your work for you like organiz- 
ing entries in date order — even 
if you don't. 

It's very flexible. 
You set it up to 
fit your business. 

Practical Accountant allows 
you to set up your "Chart of Ac- 
counts" (income and expense 
categories) with up to 50 cate- 
gories, 300 sub-categories and 
with 20 tax type definitions — all 
defined by you. The manual shows you how to set up 
an accounting system for a small business, complete 
with samples. 

Cash Flow Reporting — 

money management information . 

Perhaps the most valuable feature of the program is 
the cash flow reporting capability. You can look at 
cash flow by category, by sub-category and by tax type 
to analyze profitability, tax consequences and general 
performance. All of your reports are professionally 
formatted and you have access to profitability infor- 
mation that leads to sound business management. 

There is more to this success story. 

If you would like to know more about Practical Ac- 
countant your dealer can give you a great demonstra- 
tion and a brochure with a more complete story, or

Part 4: About Assembling 



Have you ever wondered why we call it "assembly language"? Or 
what it is, exactly, that is being "assembled"? Assemble is one of those 
computer words (like boot or RAM) that only begin to make sense when 
you know where they came from. 

We could start by saying that what is being assembled is an assembly 
! language program, and it would be true, but it wouldn't help you much. 
I Why (you might ask) do we say "assemble" instead of "compose" or 

I "construct"? 
But no: We will go 'round the circle one more time, by answering the 
question we started with; and then we wUl begin to make sense of all this. 
We call it assembly language because it is a language that was designed 
to assemble programs in. 

The key concept is this: You assemble something out of preformed 
pieces. You can select from a variety of pieces with different shapes and 
fiinctions, but you must use them as they are; you cannot change them. 
However, if the pieces (and the rules for assembling them) are well 
designed, you will be able to build strange and wonderful things with 
them— depending on how you put them together. 

In assembly language, then, the pieces are the various instructions 
that can be executed by the microprocessor. What you can build by 
assembling those pieces is an assembly language program. 

Still sounds circular, doesn't it? Okay, here's what it's all about: 
There was a time when assembly language was the only language 
available. In the early days of microcomputers, very few systems had 
Basic (Apple was one of the first to offer it as a standard feature), so if 
you wanted to write programs for your system, you had your choice of 
assembly language or machine language. 

The trouble with machine language is, it's all numbers, and, in the 
form you would enter them into the Apple, hexadecimal (base sixteen) 
numbers at that. A word of machine code is actually an electronic signal; 
but it's usually represented on paper as a pair of hexadecimal digits, such 
as $20 or $A9. Note that the dollar sign has nothing to do with money in 
this case: It indicates a hexadecimal number. 

We humans are not trained to think in numbers like that, so assembly 
language was invented: A standardized set of "code words" that repre- 
sent the numbers of machine language. Thus you could write and edit 
your program in the more human-oriented symbols of assembly language 
and then turn the result into machine language by a simple substitution 
process. 

The Microprocessor. Any program, no matter what language it's 
written in, is a set of instructions for the computer. The part of the com- 
puter that deals with instructions is the microprocessor. This is a large 
integrated circuit chip, the "brain" of your Apple: It reads instructions 
in memory, makes decisions based on those instructions, and directs 
most of the other chips in the system. 

Any programming language— Basic, Pascal, Forth, or whatever- 
must ultimately talk to the microprocessor. In fact, that's what a higher- 
level programming language is for: to make it easier for humans to give 
instructions to a computer (which means, with the Apple, to the 
microprocessor chip). The nice thing about assembly language is that it's 
structurally similar to machine language (the "language" of the 
microprocessor itself — those electronic signals mentioned earlier). 
Structurally similar means, in effect, that it uses the same rules. The 
words of the two languages are different: The machine uses numbers (of 
course), while we use real words (well, almost); the words of assembly 



language can be translated directly and easily to numeric, machine 
language, form. 

Here it is in a nutshell: The words of assembly language correspond, 
almost one to one, with the instructions that the microprocessor circuit 
can "understand" and execute. 

Instructions and Addresses. The words of assembly language are a 
set of three-letter abbreviations for the various microprocessor opera- 
tions. For example, IMP stands for jump, the assembly language 
equivalent of goto. LDA is short for load accumulator, and STX means 
store X register. The words are designed to be easy to remember, so they 
are sometimes called mnemonics. In this sense, mnemonic means a 
memory aid. 

Each word — each microprocessor operation— must refer to a par- 
ticular address: A source or destination must be specified for the data in 
the operation. That is, each word must be accompanied by a number 
(with a few exceptions). The word tells the microprocessor what to do, 
and the number tells it where to do it. 

Thus a complete statement in assembly language consists of a word

When it comes to superior performance 
we study our lines very carefully 



Superior printer performance is not a fluke. 
It evolves from analyzing printed line after 
printed line. Taking the time to test and retest. 
After 30 years of manufacturing precision 
parts, we know that there are no shortcuts. 

And so we took the Gemini-lOX and method- 
ically put it through its 120 cps pace. We 
achieved a print head life of over 100 million 
characters with an extremely precise dot align- 
ment creating each crisp character. 

So far so good. 

Next, sophisticated performance de- 
manded versatility A wide choice of 
character sets, a buffer expandable ■ ■ 
to 8K, and the ability to interface ■ 
with all popular personal 5SIC 
computers. We added macro ^J^^ 



instruction, giving Gemini-lOX the capability 
to perform up to 16 operations with one com- 
mand. We included as standard a paper 
feed system that has a friction and fully adjust- 
able tractor feed. Then we even built in the 
dexterity to print graphics and text on the 
same line. 
Done. 

And, of course, staying the best means 
constant reviewing and fine-tuning. Keeping 
the Gemini easy to find, easy to afford and so 
reliable it can be warranted for up to twice 
as long as its major competitors. 

Only the most careful 
I f^^^ engineering has built the new 
II 1^ hard-working Gemini-lOX. 
IIItm You'll applaud its performance.

and a number: technically an operator and an operand. For example, 
LDA 10 means "load the accumulator with the number stored at address 
10"; STA 20 means "store the number in the accumulator at address 
20"; LDX #30 means "load the X register with the number 30" (the # 
mark means that the number is the data itself, not the address where the 
data can be found). 

Writing It Down. There is a standard format for writing assembly 
language. It's written in lines, like Basic, but there the resemblance 
ends. A Basic line can contain almost anything you want, but it must 
have a line number. A line of assembly language can contain only certain 
specific things, in certain specific places. 

The general rule is, one "complete statement" per line: one operator 
(word) to each line, with its associated operand (address or number); and 
anything else that is appropriate, such as a label or a comment. Thus the 
shortest possible line of assembly language would be one of the few 
operators that do not require an operand, such as NOP, short for no 
operation. 

More often, a line will contain two items: an operator and an 
operand. For example, LDX #4 is "load the X register with 4"; and 
JMP LOOP means "jump to the address stored under the label LOOP." 
The operator and operand are usually placed in the middle of the line. If 
you enter a few lines like these, you'll see that they make a column (well, 
two columns close together) down the center of the screen. 

Frequendy, a line will also have a third item: a comment. This is an 
explanation of the line for the programmer's information (similar to a 
rem in Basic). In most formats, anything to the right of the operand in a 
line of assembly language is a comment. For example, "JMP LOOP Do 
it again" or "LDX #4 Set counter to 4." 



Sometimes a line will also define a label. The label will be to the left 
of the operator, in a column of its own; and if you're using an assembler 
program, it will remember this line as the one to come back to when you 
say (later on) "JMP LABEL." Here's a line with a label and a comment: 
"LOOP LDX #4 Set counter to 4." 

Dissecting a Listing. Consider the accompanying listing: This is a 
program we develojjed last month that outputs a string to the screen. We 
have divided the listing into columns (marked A through G, along the 
bottom), in order to show what goes where. The listing was produced by 
A.P.P.L.E.'s Big Mac assembler program, which is very similar to 
Southwestern Data Systems's Merlin; most assemblers will produce 
listings in a format very close to this. 

To start with, consider column C: These are the line numbers. With 
most assemblers, you don't enter these numbers; the assembler's editor 
provides them automatically. They're used for reference in editing the 
program; they aren't part of the program itself. They can't be used as the 
operand of a JMP the way line numbers are used with goto in Basic. 
They won't appear in the final machine code version. We will use these 
numbers to refer to various lines in the program during our discussion. 

In this format, column C serves another useful purpose: It separates 
the assembly language from the machine language. Yes, those funny 
numbers in column B (it looks like three columns) are machine code, but 
we'll get back to that later. The columns to the right of C are the 
assembly language program. 

The operators, or microprocessor commands, are in column E, in the 
center of the listing. This is where the "business" is done. Every line in 
the program has an entry in this column (a few blank lines have been add- 
ed to the listing for readability; but they are not part of the actual pro-

The Columns In an Assembled Listing

gram). Note that this column is made up entirely of three-letter words or 
abbreviations: You will see LDX, LDA, and JMP among them. 

For every operator in column E, there is an operand in column F 
(with two exceptions: We'll get back to them later). These operands 
identify the data that the operators will work on. For example, the data 
for line 13 is the number 0, and the data for line 14 is the address called 
LOOP, which is specified in line 19. 

Column D is for labels. If a word appears in this column on a par- 
ticular line, then you can use that word elsewhere in the program to refer 
to that line. For example, line 19 has LOOP in the label column; and 
lines 14, 16, and 24 jump to the label LOOP — that is, to line 19. 

For another example, line 21 jumps to the label EXIT — sometimes. 
BEQ is short for branch if equal. Line 20 makes a comparison test (CMP 
is short for compare), and then line 21 either jumps to line 26 or ad- 
vances normally to 22, def)ending on the result. The two operators, CMP 
and BEQ, acting together are similar in function io if A = B then goto 
in Basic. 

By the way, line 26, the EXIT line, uses one of the few operators that 
do not require an operand. RTS is the equivalent of return in Basic, so no 
operand is needed: Thus there is nothing in column F on line 26. 

Column G contains the comments. Like rem statements in Basic, 
these explain what is going on. They are for the programmer's benefit 
only and will not become part of the machine code. 

The Machine Code. So much for the human viewpoint; now let's 
take a look at what the Apple sees. Note that all the numbers to the left of 
the line numbers are in hexadecimal, even though they don't have dol- 
lar signs. 

Column B contains the complete machine language program. It's in 
the form of bytes, shown as two-digit hexadecimal numbers. Each 
number represents a word of machine code and will occupy one storage 
location in memory. There can be up to three bytes on each line. 

Here is the secret (if you haven't guessed it already): The bytes in 
column B are the machine language translation of the assembly language 
statement in columns E and F of the same line. Column B is a direct, 
statement-by-statement translation of columns E and F. 



Take lines 13, 15, and 17, for example: The assembly language ver- 
sion of each is LDX (something), and the machine code version is $A2 
(something). From this you might guess that $A2 is the machine code for 
LDX, and you would be quite right (well, almost: Technically it's a 
specific form of LDX). 

Now look at the other end of those same lines— the (something) part. 
In assembly language, they're #0, #4, and #8 respectively (remember, 
the # means "This is the data itself, not its address"); and in machine 
code, they're (X), 04, and 08. 

In other words, a line of machine code is structured just like a line of 
assembly language: first the operator and then the operand. Sometimes 
this will require two bytes, as in lines 13, 15, and 17; sometimes it will 
require three, when a two-byte address is used for the operand (line 14); 
and sometimes it will need only one, when the operator is one of those 
that don't take an operand (line 26). Thus, there is always one byte for 
the operator; and there may be one, two, or none for the operand. 

Column A is a list of memory addresses. On each line, the number in 
column A is the address at which the first byte on that line will be stored. 
Compare the addresses on two successive lines: You will see that they 
differ by the number of bytes in the first line. If a label is defined on a 
particular line (that is, if the label field on that line has a word in it), then 
that label will refer to the address in column A on that line. 

Address Logic. In assembly language, memory addresses are usually 
given as four-digit hexadecimal numbers, as in column A (the program 
begins at $302, but the listing gives $0302). The hex numbers from 
$0000 to $FFFF cover the same range as the decimal numbers from 0 to 
65,535 — in other words, the whole memory field of a 48K Apple. 

A byte of information — a word of machine code, or a number from 0 
to 255, or something else — can be written as two hex digits, and an ad- 
dress takes four hex digits. Does that mean that an address can be written 
as two bytes? The answer is, yes but. . . . 

Before we go any further, let's define a couple of terms: We're going 
to need good, solid handles on these ideas. We're not going to go 
through the whole rap on hexadecimal numbers (that's for another 
month), but we need a couple of highlights from it. We'll omit the logical

proofs and demonstrate mostly by analogy. Sorry about that, but it 
saves time. 

In the familiar decimal number system, the position of each digit is 
important. In 25, the 2 represents 2 * 10, but the 5 represents only 5. In 
246, the 2 represents 2 * 100. The further to the left a digit is, the larger 
the number it represents. 

In mathematics, the term for this is significance: The most significant 
digit of a number is on the left, and the least significant is on the right. In 
the number 125,001, the most significant group is 125 and the least 
significant is 001 . 

Now we have the handle we needed. We can look at a four-digit hex 
number like $1234, break it into two bytes, $12 and $34, and say that the 
most significant byte (MSB) is $12 and the least significant byte (LSB) is 
$34. Thus, when you type an address in this form, you normally type it 
MSB first, then LSB. 

The reason we need a good handle on this is that, in machine 
language, addresses usually fall in reverse order: LSB first, then MSB. 
The microprocessor likes to get the least significant byte first, for 
reasons we may go into some other day. 

Consider line 19, which we have labeled LOOP. The starting address 
of this line, in memory, is $030E (column A); but the various lines that 
jump to it (lines 14, 16, and 24) all read 4C OE 03— what happened 
to $030E? 

Any time you write a jump instruction in assembly language, the 
machine code must have the address in the order LSB, MSB. If you use 
an assembler program, it will take care of that for you, but if you 
translate your programs by hand, don't forget to reverse the bytes. 

Now that we've got that settled, take another look at line 19. This line 
also refers to an address: the address labeled STRNG. Looking in the 
labels column, we find STRNG on line 28; the address of line 28, in 
memory, is $03 ID. But the machine code for line 19 is BD ID 03 — once 
again, LSB first (after the operator, BD), then MSB. 

Only one other address is referred to in the program, and that one is 
backward, too. The Apple's character output routine begins at $FDED, 

If you're faithfully reading Jock Root's 
column, Everyone's Guide to Assembly 
Language, you'll find Roger Wagner's 
Assembly Lines: The Book a super com- 
panion tutorial. 

And if you're struggling to learn as- 
sembly language programming by your- 
self—don't. Assembly Lines: The Book 
can save you time and tons of frustration.

Wagner starts with the basics and works 
up to sophisticated routines. It includes 
the first fifteen serial articles (published

and our program jumps to it at line 22: 20 ED FD. Once again, the bytes 
are reversed. 

If you use an assembler, it will probably take all of this off your 
hands. If you have to assemble and translate your own machine code, or 
figure out somebody else's, remember: Addresses must be entered LSB 
first, then MSB. 

Source and Object. Before we leave the subject of assemblers, we 
should define two more terms. You won't run into them often, but 
they're part of "assembler literacy" and it may be convenient to know 
them. They are source code and object co^ie— respectively the input and 
the output of the assembly process. 

The source code is what the assembler program starts with — your in- 
put. You enter and edit a program in assembly language: This is the 
source program, since it is the source of the information that determines 
the final program. 

The object code is what the assembler program produces — the object 
of the assembly process, as a logician would put it. In other words, the 
object code is the same as the machine code. In our listing, the object 
program is in column B; the source code is in columns D, E, and F. 

Big Mac and Merlin record the source and object programs separate- 
ly, on disk: They have the same file name, but the source file has .S ap- 
pended to the name. The source file contains your assembly language 
program, which you can edit or modify as needed; the object file will 
have the machine language program, ready to brun or bload and call. 

This two-stage process — first you write and edit the source code, then 
the assembler has to turn it into object code before you can run it— can be 
a bit of a nuisance; it's one of the things that make assembly language 
more difficult to work in than Basic (Basic is interpreted every time you 
run it). There is a corresponding advantage, however: Assembly lan- 
guage runs much faster, since it doesn't have to be compiled as it runs. It 
also takes up less memory space and has other advantages; for most Ap- 
ple users, though, the main advantage is speed. If you want to write a 
tone generator, a light dimmer control, or anything else that operates in 
real time, assembly language is the only choice. 31

BYJOHNJEPPSON 

few seconds, if that. The rest of the time it's doing just what you're do- 
ing: waiting for the printer. A spooler is designed to let you use the com- 
puter during that idle time, for whatever you wish to do. When the 
printer needs more data the spooler interrupts your activities for a frac- 
tion of a second, transfers a few bytes to the printer buffer, and goes 
back to sleep. You probably won't even notice the interruption. 

So a spooler shouldn't have to be terribly complicated. You just load 
the file from disk, a chunk at a time, and dump it to the printer. In Basic 
it would take about four lines and three minutes to get such a program up 
and running. But that, of course, would miss the whole point; the Basic 
version would tie up the computer the whole time. What you want is a 
time-sharing program that will copy and print your file unattended, while 
you go on to other things. That's more complicated. 

The serial printer driver that comes with Apple III does make an ef- 
fort to minimize wasted time. If your program only sends a very short 
string of bytes to the printer driver, the bytes are accepted and stored in 
an output buffer. The driver passes them on, one byte at a time, to the 



(And Some 



Writing a spooler for Apple III turns out to be one of those mad- 
dening little projects that just seem to get more complicated the longer 
you stare at them. A spooler is really a neat idea— and, in fact, a very 
simple one. All a spooler does is transfer a file from your disk to your 
printer. But it does so in the background, running by itself on a 
time-sharing basis, while you get to use the computer yourself for other 
things. 

After all, printing is a slow process. Even a fairly fast daisy wheel 
printer, such as the Qume Sprint 5, prints only forty-five characters per 
second. This is pretty fast if you are trying to read along as it prints, but 
it's a snail's pace compared to the capabilities of Apple HI. At forty-five 
characters per second it takes the better part of a minute to print a single 
page of text, so if you're running off twenty or thirty pages of manuscript 
you've got a bit of sitting around to do. If you want to double your frus- 
tration, that's easy. Just print two copies. 

It wouldn't be so bad if the computer were really working all that 
time. But in half an hour of printing, the computer actually works only a 



spooling Around on the Side) 



RS232 serial port and thence to the printer. But you don't have to wait, at 
least not yet. As soon as data is safely stored in the printer driver's output 
buffer, the driver returns control to your program. Subsequent transfer 
from printer driver to printer is done by an interrupt handler. When the 
printer is ready for another byte of data, an interrupt occurs. The inter- 
rupt handler takes the next byte to be printed from its output and dispatch- 
es it via the RS232 port to the printer. Meanwhile, between interrupts, 
your program has control of the computer. It can use that time to prepare 
another chunk of data that, in turn, is sent to the printer driver and stored 
in the output buffer. 

As you can see, much of what we want from a spooler is already be- 
ing done. If the printer can keep emptying the output buffer as fast as 
your word processor can fill it up, there is no wasted time. In that case a 
spooler does you no good at all. The computer is already working at full 
speed; there is no idle time. 

The hooker is that the output buffer is only so big. In Apple's stan- 
dard printer driver, the buffer's capacity is fifty-five bytes. Once your 



word processor has filled up this buffer there's no place else to go. The 
printer driver receives the next data byte, checks the output buffer, and 
finds it full. So the driver simply waits, in an endless loop, until the inter- 
rupt handler creates a vacancy by sending one of the previously stored 
bytes to the printer. That won't happen until the printer is ready. If your 
Qume Sprint 5 has run out of ribbon it may never be ready. So every- 
body waits. The word processor waits for the printer driver to relinquish 
control. The printer driver waits, in an endless loop, for room in the out- 
put buffer. And the interrupt mechanism waits for a signal from the 
printer that it is ready for another byte. And you wait for all of them. 

In many printers, including the Qume Sprint 5, there is yet another 
step in this chain. The Sprint 5 also contains its own I/O buffer, 224 
bytes of RAM memory. So the Sprint 5 keeps signaling to the computer's 
interrupt mechanism to send more data until its own memory buffer is 
nearly full. But this merely postpones the traffic jam. The word proc- 
essor keeps dumping bytes into the head end of the chain for a while, but 
only until the Sprint 5's buffer is full at the other end.

TA I 1^ 



OCTOBER 1983': 



Technically speaking there is a log jam at the RS232 port. Data bytes 
only pass through the RS232 port, en route to the Sprint 5 buffer, at the 
baud rate you have selected for the printer driver (usually 1 ,200 bits per 
second). This is a drastic speed reduction from what Apple III is turning 
out. But nevertheless data does keep flowing down the chain until the 
Sprint 5 buffer is within two characters of being full. Now everything 
really does stop. Everybody waits while the printer grinds away. Even- 
tually, when the Sprint 5 buffer is within ten characters of being empty, 
there is a brief flurry of activity. The buffer gets refilled, and then every- 
body waits some more. 

The crucial point for our purposes is that the wait loop is actually 
located within the printer driver. Somehow our spooler must avoid get- 
ting trapped in that loop. This means that the spooler must never send da- 
ta to the printer driver unless it knows for sure that there is room in the 
printer driver's buffer to receive it. The standard printer driver has no 
provision for reporting the status of its buffers. But the RS232 driver 
does. Perhaps we could use that instead. 

Unfortunately, it's not enough. The spooler must also gain control of 
the interrupt mechanism. Once control has been relinquished to the 
operator it will never again return to the spooler except by way of the in- 
terrupt mechanism. So, at the very least, we will have to write a new in- 
terrupt handler. But neither the standard printer driver nor the RS232 
driver has any provision for replacing Apple's interrupt handler with 
our own. 

Obviously we will have to rewrite the printer driver, or, what 
amounts to the same thing, incorporate all that I/O code in the spooler. 
It's possible that Apple may not have provided you with a copy of the 
source code for its printer driver (fat chance!). Fortunately, the RS232 
port is quite easy to use. The necessary details are incorporated in the ac- 
companying driver. 

Creating a Disk File. Before your spooler can transfer a file from 
disk to printer the file must already be stored on disk. So when you ac- 
tually sit down to write a spooler the first hurdle is convincing your word 
processor to send its text output to a disk file instead of direcdy to the 
printer driver. This sounds easy, but like everything else connected with 
spoolers it is beset with problems. You cannot, of course, simply "save" 
the file onto disk. All word processors do allow you to save the text you 
have been editing, but the resulting disk file is not printer-ready text. It is 
just an ASCII file with, perhaps, a few associated command bytes in 
some special code known only to your word processor. It will not print; 
at least not in any form you would approve. 

When you do print from a word processor, a whole separate section 
of the program swings into action. The word processor must format text 
for the printer. It computes line lengths and inserts carriage returns. It 
generates line feeds, page breaks, left margin blanks, and all the other 
control information the printer will require. These are all inserted in 
their proper places in the text and the whole thing is sent off to the printer 
driver, usually one byte at a time. It is this output stream that you must 
somehow capture on disk. 

Could you not then simply designate a disk file in place of .Printer? 
Unfortunately not. SOS draws a clear distinction between block drivers 
such as the ProFile and floppy disk drivers and character drivers such as 
.Printer. They are handled by different sections of the operating system, 
and they use different interface structures. 

To prevent mix-ups each driver is assigned a type code and is there- 
fore branded either as a block or a character device. The type code may 
be found in the device information block at the beginning of each driver's 
code. If the high bit of byte $17 is set, the driver is a block device; other- 
wise it's a character device. This information is also returned by the Dln- 
fo SOS call (#$85), so it's very easy for your word processor to find out 
what kind of destination driver you have told it to use. Since virtually all 
programmers have been taught that the innocent public must always be 
protected from its mistakes, and since this particular mistake is rather 
easy to detect, all Apple III word processors that we know of carefully 
protect you from making it, whether you want to be protected or not. 

Would it work if you changed the type designation on a copy of the 
ProFile driver? Well, we haven't tried that, but we are confident that you 
will remember to back up absolutely everything before you do. 

If the word processor wants a character driver, why not give it a char- 
acter driver — one that accepts text output intended for the printer and 
stores it instead in a disk file. Notice that this function is independent of 
the spooler proper. The actual transfer to printer comes later, while you 



are busy with the computer doing other things. "Saving" the file may be 
carried out by a standalone character driver or may be combined with the 
rest of the spooler as a module. All that really matters is that the saver 
must be handled by SOS as though it were a separate driver. The word 
processor will then believe it is actually some newfangled type of printer 
with a fancy name. Modular drivers are well suited for the purpose. The 
modular construction allows you to write a single driver with several 
public faces. 

All reasonable word processors expect printer drivers to be written in 
the conventional form outlined in 505 Device Driver Writer's Guide. 
The word processor will first open the driver and then write to it either 
one byte or several bytes at a time. When the entire text has been written, 
the word processor, if it is a well-mannered and properly brought-up 
word processor, will politely close the driver. We hope and assume that 
your word processor will do the same. 

When the new driver, which we will call SpoolSave, is substituted for 
the printer,the first call it can expect to receive is the word processor's 
open call. Upon receiving this call the driver should, in turn, create and 
open the appropriate disk file. In order to do that it would appear that 
your driver must issue SOS calls to the ProFile or to the floppy disk 
drivers. But that is forbidden. SOS calls may never be issued from within 
the driver environment, and any attempt to do so will crash the system. 
Drivers are expected instead to use the Apple EH event mechanism. 

To use events, the driver calls a special subroutine in SOS that places 
an entry in the event queue. Once this is done, the driver may mark itself 
open and exit. Control will return to SOS. Normally it would then go 
back to the word processor. But in this case, before returning to the word 
processor, SOS notices that there is an event waiting. SOS transfers con- 
trol to the event handler, which, of course, is a little subroutine you have 
embedded right there in SpoolSave. So you are back in control of the 
computer again, but now you are no longer stuck in the driver environ- 
ment. Event handlers run in the user environment and may issue SOS 
calls. Now it's easy. The event handler creates and opens a temporary 
storage file on disk and then exits, allowing control to return, finally, to 
the word processor. 

The word processor's next move is to begin sending out a stream of 
printer-ready text to what it thinks is the printer. Usually it will send one 
byte at a time. That is, the word processor will probably issue a separate 
D Write SOS call for each byte in the output stream. Apple Writer ///and 
Word Juggler each send single bytes, and the same is probably true for 
all the others. This, of course, is terribly inefficient; but remember that a 
word processor thinks it is dealing with a printer, and no inefficiency in 
the computer will ever be as slow as a printer. 

You may also want your driver to be able to handle multibyte write 
requests should they occur. Such multibyte requests are issued by the 
Pascal Editor and by the transfer command in the Pascal Filer. Since 
each separate SOS call requires an overhead of about 150 microseconds, 
handling a number of output bytes in each DWrite call is quite a lot fast- 
er. It is barely conceivable that the writer of some future word processor 
might realize this, but don't hold your breath. 

Meanwhile, since there is no obvious way to speed up the word proc- 
essor itself, the amount of waiting time you will actually eliminate by us- 
ing a spooler depends largely on how rapidly your word processor 
generates its output stream. If the word processor is just managing to 
keep ahead of your printer there will be no idle time to save. But not to 
worry. It isn't easy to run as slowly as a printer. 

In any event, the word processor's output stream will arrive at 
SpoolSave as a series of DWrite requests. The driver, in turn, must pass 
on this data to the disk file, a step that again requires a SOS call. The 
most straightforward technique is for SpoolSave to store the data in a 
local memory location and queue up another event. It will then be easy 
for the event handler, working in the user environment, to transfer that 
data to the disk driver with a DWrite SOS call. 

This procedure does work, but it will probably mean that the com- 
puter will end up processing an event and a second SOS call for every 
byte in the output stream. This will only compound the inefficiency of 
the word processor. You, on the other hand, want SpoolSave to handle 
the printer-ready text as rapidly as possible. The whole business will be 
futile if storing the file on disk takes longer than it would have taken to 
print the text in the first place. The solution is to save up a bunch of data 
bytes in a fairly large local buffer and send the whole buffer to disk all 
at once.

OCTOBER 1983 



In theory SpoolSave's buffer could be large enough to hold the entire 
text. In that case you wouldn't even need a temporary disk file; the 
spooler could print directly from your I/O buffer in memory. But that 
would tie up vast amounts of memory that could never be used by the 
word processor. The best compromise is a modest buffer that holds 
an integral number of blocks. Disk drivers always read and write entire 
blocks, so maximum efficiency is achieved if you save up some multiple 
of 512 bytes. We have elected to use two blocks, or 1,024 bytes. A buf- 
fer that size uses little memory and requires only one disk access for 
every 1,000-plus characters of text. 

If SpoolSave does receive just one byte at a time, the procedure is 
straightforward. The DWrite code in SpoolSave transfers the incoming 
data byte from the word processor's source buffer to the next free byte in 
its own local buffer. Then, if the local buffer is full, it queues up another 
event; otherwise it just exits back to the word processor. When the event 
handler is called it dumps the full buffer to the temporary disk file and 
resets the buffer pointers. Then the process begins again. 

It's a bit more complicated for multibyte requests. SpoolSave must 
always accept all the bytes presented to it. It cannot, for example, handle 
some of the data, exit the driver to enter an event handler, dump the buff- 
er, and then somehow return to SpoolSave to finish processing the re- 
quest. There is no legal way back. So you really have to know the max- 
imum number of bytes that will ever be requested and make sure that at 
least that much room is always available in your buffer. 

If the word processor, or some other source program, is capable of 
sending a very large number of bytes all at once, then you've got a prob- 
lem. The transfer command in the Pascal Filer, for example, may send 
many thousands of bytes in a single request. There's no way you could 
handle this with a local buffer. But all is not lost. You simply let the disk 
driver make the transfer. Your driver makes a local record of the point- 
ers to the source buffer and the number of bytes to be transferred and 
then queues an event. The event handler, in turn, uses those same param- 
eters in its own DWrite SOS call to the disk driver. It's very slick for 
large multibyte requests, but for single-byte requests from word proc- 
essors it is considerably more efficient to save up a bunch of output 
bytes in your own local buffer. 

When the word processor is finished printing your text, or so it 
thinks, it will send a DClose SOS call to SpoolSave. The driver should 
then mark itself closed and queue up yet another event. This time the 
event handler must dump any remaining data in the local buffer onto disk 
and close the storage file. 

At this point SpoolSave's job is done. We could, in fact, immediately 
start up the spooler and begin to print the text. But it is more flexible to 
have a separate trigger for the actual printing. This will make it easier to 
print multiple copies and also will allow you to do the printing at a later 
time, perhaps after you have booted up an entirely different disk. 

Firing Up the Spooler. Actual printing is done by the spooler prop- 
er, which we shall refer to as SpoolPrint. By coding this part as a sepa- 
rate module it will be handled by SOS as a completely separate driver. 
That will permit any command in any language to trigger the spooler, as 
long as it is capable of opening the driver. In a word processor, for ex- 
ample, you could place a very short text of approximately zero length in 
the editor and instruct the word processor to print it to SpoolPrint. The 
word processor will issue a DOpen call to SpoolPrint and the driver can 
take it from there. In other languages you can use any open, save, store, 
copy, or transfer command. 

Don't forget that the word processor will be most unhappy if it cannot 
complete the entire process of printing the text (it won't take long). So in 
addition to its principal job, SpoolPrint should also provide some dummy 
code to field DWrite and DClose SOS calls. A simple return will do. 

SpoolPrint 's first task is to open the disk file containing the text to be 
printed. That, of course, requires a SOS call and must be done from the 
user environment. So we need another event. You may, in the same 
event, wish to input the appropriate file name from the keyboard as we 
have done in the accompanying driver. SOS calls make it easy. 

Conceptually the main spooling cycle is straightforward. The Qume 
printer's internal buffer has been filled and the printer is madly pounding 
away. You are also madly pounding away on the keyboard. The Apple 
ni, in fact, is so enthralled by what you are typing that it has completely 
forgotten about the printer. Suddenly an interrupt occurs. The printer has 
announced that it needs more data. The interrupt driver in SpoolPrint 
quickly transfers a few more bytes from its own buffer (the same one 



used by SpoolSave) and, almost immediately, is gone. Once in a while, 
however, when SpoolPrint's own buffer is empty, the interrupt handler 
sets an event. This event handler, of course, reads more data from the 
disk and refills SpoolPrint's transfer buffer. Then all continues as be- 
fore. At least that's the theory. The implementation is another matter. 

Up to this point, whenever we've wanted to use SOS calls we've 
simply switched to the user environment by queuing an event. The driver 
exits, SOS transfers control to the event, and we continue right on in the 
event handler. The reason this works is that when we exit a driver SOS 
normally expects to return us directly to the user environment. That is, 
when we leave the driver we are on our way back to the word processor 
or Pascal or whatever the main program happens to be. Along the way, 
SOS processes our event. 

The sticky point for spoolers is that SOS checks the event queue only 
when returning to the user environment. We are able to transfer to the 
user environment of an event handler only because we are headed back to 
the main program when we exit a driver. Events work very nicely for 
drivers, but not so for interrupt handlers; the spooler runs primarily in an 
interrupt handler. 

Exiting an interrupt handler may or may not mean that you are head- 
ed back to the main program and therefore to the user environment. 
Usually it does not. If an interrupt occurs while one of the drivers is 
running, SOS will return control to that driver when the interrupt han- 
dler exits. The interrupt handler may have queued an event, but the event 
will not be processed, at least not then. Control will go straight back to 
the driver that was interrupted, and only when that driver has finished 
and control is actually on its way back to the main program will SOS 
check the event queue and process the event. 

Interrupts, by their very nature, occur randomly. The place where the 
computer spends most of its time determines the environment that most 
often will be interrupted. And where does the computer spend most of its 
time? About 99 percent of the time it is waiting for you to enter the next 
keypress. 

This is a real problem for Apple III spxjolers. The spooler is supposed 
to work in the background while you are busy creating deathless prose on 
the word processor. So the computer will actually be waiting for you, for 
your next perfect sentence. But it waits within the console driver. The 
word processor requests each keypress by issuing a DRead SOS call to 
the console driver, and the console driver waits while you think about 
what to say. Our word processor, we are sure, has the patience of Job. 

The effect is unpleasant. The spooler does work, after a fashion, but 
each time SpoolPrint's buffer is empty the printer stops. The interrupt 
handler queues an event, but nothing happens. Then, in the silence of 
creative ecstasy you begin to type. Wham! The printer starts off again, 
and out goes your thought and your Nobel Prize in literature. It's very 
depressing. 

There are a variety of solutions — none, so far as we know, entirely 
legal. The conventional approach (not the approach used in the accom- 
panying driver) is to work on the console driver. The console, after all, 
is where the hang-up usually takes place. Somehow you've got to break 
up the console driver's wait loop, at least momentarily, so that SOS will 
process SpoolPrint's event. The trick is to make the console driver itself 
set an event and exit, instead of waiting around in a loop. The console's 
event handler then turns right around and issues a DRead SOS call back 
to the console driver again. It is really issuing the call to itself, but SOS 
doesn't know that. Strictly speaking the process is not reentrant. The 
console driver simply cycles back and forth between the console's 
DRead code and an event handler. Since all events are handled first- 
come, first-serve (assuming they are assigned the same priority), any 
other events that may have been queued will be processed between 
cycles. 

In practice it's a bit tricky. First you take your handy copy of the con- 
sole driver source code (hah!) and locate the wait loop. You will find it in 
a subroutine called by DRead. You must change this code so that when- 
ever a requested keypress is not available the driver sets an event and ex- 
its. The event handler, in turn, issues a DRead call and soon you are back 
again at DRead in the console driver. This secondary call must, of 
course, be distinguished from the original call, but that is easily ac- 
complished by a semaphore flag from the event handler. 

In order to issue a DRead call the event handler must somehow obtain 
a valid file reference number. The easiest method is for the event handler 
to maintain its own separate access path to the console with its own file

reference number. On rare occasions, however, this may not be possible. 
A private access path to the console will require SOS to find room for the 
associated I/O buffer it maintains for each file. Some application pro- 
grams may already have reserved each byte of free memory in the 
machine, in which case your event's open call to the console will fail. If 
you are really worried about this you can obtain instead the original pro- 
gram's file reference number by finding your way back to the original 
code and looking in the caller's parameter list. You will need the caller's 
bank number and program counter from the stack (see table 1). Re- 
member that the program counter is stored as a bank-switched address 
that must be converted for extended addressing.

A third possibility for returning to the console driver involves use of 
your own special duty DControl call. These calls require only the con- 
sole device number, which is easily obtainable; you won't need a file 
reference number at all. We are less certain, however, that we can fully 
restore the former conditions in the console driver if we have reentered 
with a device call. But it will probably work. 

Once you are back in the console driver's DRead code you should 
find out if a keypress has become available. It will be in the typeahead 
buffer. If the typeahead buffer is still empty, you just set a semaphore 
flag and exit. You will then, of course, be returned to the event handler 
just beyond the SOS call. The semaphore flag tells the event handler to 
loop back and try the DRead call again. 

On the other hand, if the typeahead buffer is not empty, you know 
that someone has punched the keyboard. Now you want to restore every- 
thing to the state it was in before you began all this. Naturally everything 
you restore will previously have to have been saved. We used the brute 
force approach and saved the following: the local subroutine return ad- 
dress and all the 6502 registers; the SOS call parameters and everything 
else on zero page between $C0 and $FF; the corresponding xbytes 
$14C0..$14FF; all the console driver status parameters totaling $C9 
bytes beginning at byte $61 of the driver; and a data byte that DRead has 
already placed on the stack. If the overflow flag (bit 6) of the 6502 status 
register is set, then there are two data bytes on the stack. 

After all this is restored you may jump back to the original wait point. 
The console driver will go on about its business as though you had never 
been messing around (we hope). Once the read request is satisfied, 
however, the driver will exit back to the event handler, not to the original 
calling program. This is okay; the original return address is now the 
return address of the event. But before exiting, the event handler must 
store the last DRead SOS call error code, returned in the A register, into 
the ninth byte down on the stack. This will later be restored as the call- 
er's A register (see table 1). 

This scheme actually works. It was amazingly difficult to debug, for 
reasons that remain obscure. The method does take frightful liberties 
with the SOS abstract machine, but the only thing that's actually illegal is 
knowledge of the stack usage detailed in table 1 . Theoretically Apple 
may decide some day to use a different arrangement of information on 
the stack, but it seems unlikely. 

The real problem is that you need a copy of the console driver source 
code. You may be able to get one from Apple. We made a reconstruc- 
tion—but that's another story. And even if you do have the source code, 
this scheme means that your spooler is chained forever to a particular 
version of the console driver, and an unauthorized version at that. So if 
you're going to be illegal about it, why not go just a bit further and get 
yourself a standalone spooler that will work with any console driver? 



Wicked Ways! There's no doubt about it. The accompanying driver 
is definitely illegal. It may also crash the system in some unusual circum- 
stance that has yet to be encountered. In our admittedly limited testing, 
however, it worked very well. 

The difficulty with setting events from an interrupt handler is that the 
event may not be processed for a long time, if ever. But the only purpose 
in setting an event in the first place is just to get into the user environ- 
ment. We want to be able to issue SOS calls. In the accompanying driver 
the interrupt handler doesn't set events. We simply change the environ- 
ment. Later, after making the necessary SOS calls, we switch back to the 
interrupt handler environment again. It's a real no-no. But we can get 
away with it if we can prevent SOS from suspecting what we're doing. It 
involves a lot of saving and restoring. 

The reason drivers are not allowed to issue SOS calls is that SOS is 
not designed to be reentrant. Each SOS call, for instance, reinitializes the 
6502 stack, the private stack used by SOS. Anything already on the stack 
would be lost. SOS calls also use specific registers on the SOS zero page 
for interfacing with drivers, and these would be overwritten in a reen- 
trant SOS call. The same difficulty exists for interrupt handlers. More 
often than not an interrupt handler will interrupt one of the drivers (and 
therefore a SOS call in progress). So any SOS calls issued by an interrupt 
handler would almost certainly be reentrant as well. 

There are many other problems. SOS keeps track of open files. Sup- 
pose the reentrant SOS call were to close a file that is still the subject of 
another uncompleted SOS call. How about moving file marks around, or 
overwriting partial data already present in the I/O buffers? The bottom 
line is that only code running in the user environment may issue SOS 
calls, and every SOS call must be thoroughly complete before control 
may be returned to the user environment. 

So if we are to succeed with illegal environment twiddling, we must 
be careful to restore everything that might be overwritten and to over- 
write as little as possible. We will be making a very limited intrusion on 
territory owned by SOS— more of a raid than an invasion. If you actual- 
ly know how to make SOS truly reentrant, with recursive SOS calls in 
depth, call collect! 

The accompanying driver illustrates the method. Our interrupt han-

dler wants to refill the transfer buffer by making a DRead SOS call to the 
disk file. We transform the system to the user environment and issue the 
SOS call. Then we restore everything and go back to being an interrupt 
handler again. As far as we can tell, things go on as before. 

One of the bugs that were encountered illustrates the pitfalls. At one 
point the spooler was skipping some text now and then. The skip oc- 
curred at apparently random locations in the text but was always $0400 
bytes in length. That happens to be the size of the transfer buffer. It turns 
out, we think, that SOS was having trouble keeping track of the file 
mark. Apparently the act of restoring the interrupt environment was 
erasing or distorting SOS's record of our position within the file. Now 
that isn't so mysterious. What is still something of a mystery is why it 
should happen intermittently. We are meddling in a very complicated 
system without a road map. But fortunately that particular problem could 
be solved by maintaining our own position record and resetting the file 
mark accordingly. 

We have followed our traditional approach— brute force. 6502 inter- 
rupts are already disabled, since we start out in an interrupt handler. We 
save the following: SOS's stack pointer and all the active bytes in SOS's 
stack; the entire user stack page ($lBxx); the environment, zero page, 
and bank registers; the interval $CO..$FF on SOS's zero page ($18xx) 
and the corresponding xbytes $14C0..$14FF. Next we establish the stan- 
dard user environment by storing $38 in the environment register and 
$1A in the zero-page register. Finally we reinitialize the user stack and 
enable 6502 interrupts. Restoration, of course, proceeds in reverse 
order. 

If you ever use this method in another application you may want to 
put all the switching code in a subroutine. But don't forget that the en- 
vironment switch will also change stack page. Your subroutine return 
address will vanish in the mist. You may, however, jump back and forth 
by building the return jump instruction "on the fly." 

The accompanying driver takes one other precaution. We avoid any 
hanky-panky while the main program is trying to access a floppy disk. 
The floppy disk drivers have a common I/O buffer on page $02, and it 
wouldn't do to have two floppy access calls fighting over the same space. 
It so happens that the floppy disk drivers run with ROM enabled, so the 
interrupt handler can use this fact to tell if a conflict is about to occur. 
The value of the environment that was interrupted will be found in the 
sixth byte down on SOS's stack (see tables 2 and 3). 

Some SOS calls seem to be more dangerous than others in an artificial 
user environment. Calls to character devices, for example, should be 
safer than calls to block devices, since SOS keeps fewer records about 
character devices, mainly just the access path to get there. Similarly, 
read calls to disk files seem much safer than write calls. The only perma-

nent damage you can ever do to your system is to destroy the dictionary 
structure of a disk by writing stuff in the wrong place. It's a real disaster 
on the ProFile, so back everything up. In theory you could even mess up 
SOS in such a way that it would later wreck your disk. This is unlikely, 
but Lloyd's of London won't cover you if it does. 

Be particularly wary of overlapping file calls that use the same I/O 
buffer in SOS. This would occur, for example, when an access call to a 
particular fde reference number is interrupted, and the interrupt handler 
then makes an illicit call to the same file reference number. In this con- 
nection there is cause for concern, as noted earlier, about all overlapping 
calls to the floppy drivers. They do share a common pathway through a 
buffer on page $02 of the lower system memory bank. It's an evolu- 
tionary relic from Apple n, like an appendix. 

This particular concern may, however, be unwarranted. Presumably, 
each open floppy disk file also has its own separate I/O buffer 
somewhere in memory, as do all open files maintained by SOS. The 
common pathway area on page $02 may be protected. It may be that this 
area is saved, or at least reloaded after every interrupt. Certainly the 
presence of repeated interrupts during floppy disk access will greatly 
prolong access time, as you will notice while using the spooler. Loading 
or saving a file may take twice or three times as long as it usually does. 

You may demonstrate this effect with a different interrupt source by 
holding down control-keypad 5 and the closed apple key while loading or 
saving a file. This combination generates an endless rapid sequence of 
keyboard interrupts and is a handy tool for testing the emotional stability 
of interrupt-controlled drivers. Notice that the prolongation effect does 
not seem to occur when using the ProFile. 

You may wish to use these illegal methods in other applications. We 
wish you luck. If you have problems you might try saving and restoring 
more stuff, such as the rest of SOS's zero page or the areas on page $19 
that SOS uses for temporaries. We have only one request, should you do 
this: Don't tell Apple that we suggested it.

Other Apple DOS" files 

Available for Apple™ II, lie, and III. 

Until now, data files and reports created by a software package 
such as D Base iT or Pie Writer™ were limited to use only by that 
particular software. When it became necessary to perform 
analysis in VisiCalc™, the only solution was to rekey each data 
item, a tremendous waste of time and effort 
Calc-Connector™ is a revolutionary program that takes format- 
ted reports or text file and loads it into VisiCalc™ file. Once in 
VisiCalc™, the data can be calculated and manipulated just as any 
other VisiCalc" created file. 

Calc-Connector™ works on any C/PM or Apple DOS™ text file 
in column format Downloaded mainframe reports can also be 
easily converted to VisiCalc™ worksheets. Calc-Connector™ 

allows you to choose the specific lines that you need. The file 
loads as a standard VisiCalc" worksheet with labels and values; 
no need to hassle with DIF" I

TerminAII allows your 
Apple /// to simulate each

different terminal? 
TerminAII can be changed 
to simulate most popular 
computer terminals. 



Large computers and computer services are designed to 
communicate with computer terminals, not personal 
computers. Often programs on large computers will not 
operate correctly when accessed from a personal 
computer. With TerminAII your Apple /// can act like the 
computer terminal you need. Save the expense of 
purchasing more costly hardware, use TerminAII and your 
Apple ///. 

TerminAII simulates the commonly used features of most 
popular terminals including: cursor addressing, insert and 
delete lines, clear screen, clear line, clear to end of line, 
communication protocols, inverse video, and more.

Filins Made Easy 



by Christopher U. Lisht 



When the Apple II first came out, random access memory cost a lot 
more than it does now. For a long time, 16K was the standard RAM con- 
figuration. Since DOS uses almost lOK, that didn't leave much room for 
creative programming. In fact, some early users had to choose between 
using a disk drive and using hi-res graphics. 

For that reason Applesoft was designed without DOS commands. 
The best way to deal with large amounts of data was to use the Applesoft 
read and data statements. This situation didn't lend itself to flexible data 
handling; the data could only be edited by editing the lines of the pro- 
gram, which was fine for the programmer but a nuisance for the user. 
When systems with 32 or 48K of RAM became more common, DOS was 
introduced, and Apple programmers got their first taste of text files. 

Text files provide a way for Applesoft to write and read large 
amounts of data to and from the disk. Unlike data statements, text files 
can't be edited directly from the keyboard at all, but they can be handled 
by Applesoft. This means that the programmer is free to write elaborate 
programs to make it much easier for the user to manipulate data. It's a 
more complicated situation, but overall a better one. 

The Hidden Language. As a result of DOS's relatively late introduc- 
tion into the Apple scene, very roundabout methods must be used in 
order to fool Basic into issuing disk commands under the guise of print 



statements. Manipulating text files involves a further degree of fooling 
Applesoft; DOS sets things up so that reading and writing text files is 
done with the same commands that Applesoft thinks are reserved for 
reading from the keyboard and writing on the screen. 

Text files are pesky things. They're generated by persuading Ap- 
plesoft to do things it was never intended to do. Nevertheless, they are 
the only convenient way to handle data to be used by (but not included in) 
a Basic program. 

Apple's DOS has two types of text files, sequential and random ac- 
cess. Sequential files are more common and use storage space more effi- 
ciently, but random access files make it easier for the user to retrieve part 
of the data. We'll look at both kinds of files in detail in part two of this 
article. This month we'll examine text files in general by concentrating 
on commands that are common to both sequential and random access 
files. As it happens, you end up with a sequential text file by default if 
you don't specify which one you want, so you'll actually be working 
with sequential files this time. Don't concern yourself with that for the 
moment; just think of them as text files. 

Most disk commands, such as load and save, can be used directly 
from the keyboard. None of them can be used directly from a program 
because Applesoft simply doesn't recognize them. Therefore, it's 



OCTOBER IS 



292 

necessary to disguise a disk command as an Applesoft command and 
prefix it with control-D to let DOS know that the command is intended 
for it. The Applesoft command used for this is print, and printing 
control-D followed by a DOS command in quotes will bypass Applesoft 
and operate the drive. 

There are several ways to get that control-D in, one of which is fool- 
proof. Another is almost foolproof and is a little easier. The first one 
works like this: 

100 PRINT CHR$(4);"D0S COMMAND" 

CHR$(4) is an Applesoft way of saying control-D. One thing to 
remember is that, if the last print command executed ended with a 
semicolon, DOS won't see the control-D. Even though the control-D 
doesn't really print, DOS will see it only if it's printed at the beginning of 
a line. 

The second method is to put the control-D in a string variable and 
then replace CHR$(4) with the variable name in the command. If you put 
several DOS commands in a program, this approach makes the typing 
task easier and saves a few bytes of memory. These lines show how this 
approach works: 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) 

100 PRINT D$;"DOS COMMAND" 

The D$ assignment must be early in the program, before any 
DOS commands. 

To see control-D in action, place an initialized disk in your drive, 
type new, and run the following small program: 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) 

20 PRINT D$: "SAVE THIS PROGRAM" 

Check the catalog to make sure the program did what you expected. 

Unfortunately, you can't simply "tload" and "tsave" a text file the 
way you can bload and bsave binary files. Data is transferred to and from 
text files using existing Basic commands: print and input. 

Because a text file is the creation of a Basic program, the only way 
you're really going to learn how to make and use text files is to take the 
point of view of a Basic program. Think of it this way. To a user, the in- 
put command means, "Enter something from the keyboard." To a pro- 
gram, however, input means, "Go to the keyboard and bring back 
some data." 

Now think of input used to read data from text files. Lxjoked at from 
the point of view of a Basic program, input is a command to Basic to re- 
quest data, in this case from DOS. It's not a command to DOS to load 
data into memory. 

All we need, then, is a way to tell DOS to intercept those input and 
print commands. We do this with the four text file commands we'll be 
covering this month: open, close, read, and write. Although we'll be us- 
ing these commands with sequential files only, they apply to both ran- 
dom access and sequential text files. 

As always when you're learning new things about DOS, have an in- 
itialized disk in your drive that's otherwise blank or that has only pro- 
grams you can afford to lose. There's always the possibility that you'll 
make a mistake and accidentally erase or replace one or more files. 

Now type new and enter the following program: 

10 D$ = CHR$(4) 

20 PRINT D$;"MON C, 1,0" 

30 PRINT D$;"OPEN TREASURE CHEST" 

100 PRINT D$;"CLOSE TREASURE CHEST" 

Before you run this program, a couple of things ought to be noted. 
Line 10, as we've seen, defines the string D$ as control-D so that a com- 
mand in quotes that follows immediately will be taken as a DOS com- 
mand. In line 20 the command mon tells DOS to print certain informa- 
tion about the drive's interaction with the computer (depending on which 
parameters follow it) . The parameter C results in DOS commands being 
displayed, while I and O produce displays of the actual data transferred 
during input and output. Input here refers to data sent from the drive to 
the Apple, while output refers to data moving in the opposite direction. 
The commas between the parameters are not strictly necessary and, as 
Bert Kersey once showed, the name of a small European country, 
monico, works just as well. To turn off the display, use the command 
nomonico. 



The Empty Treasure Chest. Run the program now and you'll notice 
that your DOS commands appear on the screen because of the mon com- 
mand. Examine the catalog after running the program and you'll see a 
text file named Treasure Chest. It occupies one sector. This text file was \ 
created by the DOS command open in line 30. 

Opening a new file reserves at least one sector for that file. At this 
point the file is only one sector long because all that DOS has actually 
done so far is to enter the name you've given the file into the disk's direc- 
tory. The directory records the name and type of each file, its length in 
sectors, and the location on the disk where DOS can find it. 

In addition, the command open reserves 595 bytes of the Apple's 
memory— that's internal computer memory, not disk storage space— as a 
temporary storage buffer for information being transferred between the 
disk and the computer. If there's already a file with the name Treasure 
Chest on the disk, open allocates a memory buffer for that file. It doesn't 
create a second file with the same name. 

After the command close, the catalog still shows the file as using only 
one sector. The file itself is still empty because no command to enter data 
into the memory buffer was issued. Had the buffer not been empty, how- 
ever, DOS would have transferred data to the disk as the buffer filled up. 
The command to close the file saves any information still in the buffer to 
disk. It then makes a note to itself indicating that the buffer that file had 
been using is now free and available. After closing a file, you have to 
open that specific file by name before you can use it again. 

Teach Your Apple the Other Two Rs. The other two text file com- 
mands used with both sequential and random access files are write and 
read. When we look at these commands from the standpoint of the pro- 
gram in the Apple's memory and not from that of the user, we realize 
that the first deals with output and the second with input. Write refers to 
transferring data from the computer to the disk, and read to getting data 
from the disk. 

Add the following line to your program and run it again: 

40 PRINT D$;"WRITE TREASURE CHEST" 

As before, you'll see when you catalog that your text file is still only one 
sector long. Neither the write nor read command actually transfers any 
data to or from the disk. All they do is prepare DOS to look for one of 
two ordinary Applesoft commands, print or input. 

After a write command is executed, print sends output to the buffer 
reserved for the specified text file instead of sending the output to the 
screen. After a DOS read command, the Applesoft input command takes 
data from the file buffer instead of the keyboard. Internally, DOS 
handles the necessary details of transferring data between the buffer and 
the file on disk. When the input command empties the buffer, DOS 
transfers another sector from the file to the disk. When print fills a 
buffer, DOS transfers its contents to the disk. 

Get statements as well as input statements can be used with read, 
although get can cause problems with monico on. Both DOS read and 
write commands are canceled by any subsequent DOS statement or just 
print D$ (if D$ has been defined as control-D). 

To enter data into the file, use Applesoft's print command in the usual 
way after the write statement. Add the following loop to your program: 

50 FOR I = 1 TO 300 
60 PRINT I 
70 NEXT I 

When you run it, you'll see a column of numbers from 1 to 300. Every so 
often the buffer will fill up, and the column will stop scrolling for a mo- 
ment while DOS turns on the drive and saves the data in the buffer to the 
disk. When the file is closed, the last data is saved and the buffer is 
released for other uses. If you check the catalog, you'll see that the text 
file named Treasure Chest now uses six disk sectors. Save your Basic 
program with the name Write Treasure. Now modify the Basic program 
by entering the following lines, save it with the name Read Treasure, and 
then run it. 

5 DIM A$(300) 

40 PRINT D$;"READ TREASURE CHEST" 

60 INPUT A$(l) 

200 FOR J = 1 TO 300 

210 PRINT A$(J) 

220 NEXT J 



OCTOBER 1983

This program opens the file created by the other program and reads 
the information from the disk as input (just as if you were typing it from 
the keyboard, but a lot faster). Because of the mon command in line 20 
the program displays the data and commands as it runs. Finally, the pro- 
gram closes the file and prints the data it has stored in the A$ array. 
Technically a numeric array (A instead of A$) would be better, but 
we've used a string array here because we'll need one later. When the 
program is reading from the disk, you'll see a question mark before each 
number because of the way we have used the Applesoft input statement, 
which was designed originally to prompt the user to enter data from the 
keyboard. We can provide our own prompt by putting a character, word, 
or sentence between quotes after the word input, or we can eliminate the 
prompt entirely by changing line 60 to read input" ";A$(I). If you don't 
want to see the input at all, type nomonico and delete line 20. 

Any Old Data Will Do. Lines 200 and beyond are ordinary Ap- 
plesoft lines with no disguised disk commands, and they illustrate the 
fact that the data that your program has received from the disk can be 
used in any way Applesoft considers legal. In fact, any legal type of 
data— whether string or numeric— can be stored in or retrieved from a 
text file. In order to show how partial files are saved to the disk when the 
buffer fills up, we had the program generate 300 numbers. 

Now let's see how data for text files can be entered from the key- 
board. Delete Treasure Chest from your disk, then load the program 
you've saved as Write Treasure and make the following changes in it: 

3 FOR I = 1 TO 5 

5 INPUT "ENTER A WORD";A$(l) 

7 NEXT I 

50 FOR I = 1 TO 5 
60 PRINT A$(l) 

The Write Treasure program is now similar to a phone list or database 
filing system. You can retrieve data entered into it as often as you like, 
even after turning off the computer and turning it on again. Just run the 
Read Treasure program with lines 50 and 200 modified to stop the loops 
at 5 instead of 300. 



Notice that we did not adopt what on the surface would appear to be 
a logical simplification by entering line 5 as line 55 and skipping lines 3 
through 7. In other words, we did not include an input between the write 
and close commands. Go ahead and try it if you like. What you'll find is 
that, because the input command contains a buried print command in 
order to put its prompt on the screen, the phrase "enter a word" will end 
up in your file. Furthermore, the input command cancels the write com- 
mand. That's why we filled up the array with data first and then wrote 
the contents of that array to the disk. 

If you try a similar approach in the other direction, however, you'll 
be okay. Add the line 65 print A$(I) to your Read Treasure program and 
have the program print as it receives input without filling up the array 
first. When in doubt and given enough free memory, however, it's prob- 
ably best to do all of your data manipulation outside the open and close 
statements, reserving the text file manipulation loops strictly for that 
purpose. 

Read It, Write It, Throw It Away. That should be enough on se- 
quential files, but there's one more thing to mention. You'll notice that 
we deleted the old Treasure Chest text file— the one with numbers 1 to 
300 in it— before we entered words into a new file with the same name. 
Once a file is opened under any given name, it remains on the disk until 
deleted. Any time a new file is opened with the same name on the same 
disk and data is written to it, the data will start at the beginning of the file 
and overwrite an amount of the old data equal to its own length. Any old 
data beyond that will remain intact. Thus, unless you delete the old file, 
you wUl probably lose some of the old data and end up with a mess con- 
sisting of some of the old and some of the new. 

DOS has ways to handle this problem directly, which we'll get to 
next month. Until then, it may be a good idea to open and read the old 
file, using your Applesoft program to erase, change, or add data to an 
Applesoft array. Then delete and reopen the file (from your program) 
and write the entire new file to the disk. 

Next month we'll cover random access files. We'll talk about how 
they differ from sequential files and how to decide whether to use one or 
the other. 31 



if you've been dying to aciiieve spec- 
tacular maciiine language speeds, 
tiiere's probably one tiling tiiat's been 
stopping you. The hard work that it 
takes to become a machine language 
programmer. 

Well now there's a shortcut that lets you 
write Applesoft-like programs which are 
converted directly into machine language. 
It's MACROSOFT, a new language that 
is designed to work with The Assembler 
by MicroSPARC. 

MACROSOFT allows a beginner to 
get machine language speeds for spec- 
tacular graphics and rapid-fire games. It 
gives advanced programmers the con- 
venience of mixing assembly language 
and MACROSOfH" in the same program. 

MACROSOFT also gives you new 
commands that don't exist in Applesoft. 
Commands for creating powerful sound 
effects, graphics, and more compact 
programs. 

MACROSOFT is so fast that you may 
even have to add delay routines so things 
stay on the screen long enough to read 
them. If that's the kind of speed you've 
been longing for, you've waited long 
enough. MACROSOFT is here.

CUT TAXES • CONTROL EXPENSES • SAVE ON ACCOUNTING 



CHECKBOOK FINANCIAL SYSTEM 

For Apple" II, II + , lie, III emulation, and Apple look-alikes - 48K DOS 3.3 



TAX WHACKER! 

The picture below shows my 1983 medical expenses 
exactly as printed by Money Street. Before year 
end, I'll use this report to plan tax strategy. Maybe 
I'll save on income taxes; maybe I won't. At least I 
get the chance to plan before the year is out. 

I'm Bob Payne, co-creator of Money Street, a new 
checkbook financial system for the Apple. This 
program saves me money because it doesn't miss a 
single deduction or tax credit. 

But Money Street does more than cut taxes. Look 
at the picture again. Notice emphasized type face 
Money Street can coax from my Epson (and many 
other dot matrix printers). After I'm done with 
Money Street, I leave my printer "on" and use this 
type face with my word processor. It's a small extra, 
but very handy. 

Show us a picture. People often ask to see 
Money Street's reports. They say, "Before I buy, I 
want to see what it does." We agree, so we've 
numbered the photo to explain things. 

Money Street prints 15 different reports. No set-up 
is required, just go to the report menu and select 
which report you want. See it on-screen or print it. 
Money Street's start-up-to-print-time is less than 20 
seconds. Shown below is the "Sort by Code" report: 

1. Each check, debit, and deposit gets its own entry 
number, an automatic feature of the program. 
You can get a printed record of all checkbook 
entires any time: a chronological history of your 
checkbook including your running balance each 
step of the way. A supurb audit tool! 

2. Use the "Filed Field" to locate cancelled 
checks because it shows the statement date 



each check cleared. This feature lets you keep all 
cancelled checks with their original bank 
statement just as most CPAs advise. 

3. Sort and print by check number to create a 
check register. 

4. You can sort by date to see monthly income, 
expenses, or net amounts. Print totals or details; 
just press one key. 

5. Not only can you sort by payee, you can sort on 
a "wildcard" option too. Many Money Street 
owners use this option to sort tax flag items. 

6. All printouts show the report title plus today's 
Date. Not shown in photo, but included on all 
reports, is a spot for your name. 

7. You get 100 user-defined codes. To set up 
codes, just type them in. Add, Delete, or change 
codes any time without affecting data. 

You can code income items, expenses, or mix 
both for net amounts, for example, to see profits 
by categories. 

Sort by individual codes, groups of codes, or 
entire file. Year-to-date totals are always available 
with the press of a single key. 

8. Yes, you can even sort by amount. It's great for 
tracking down errors or seeing income or 
spending patterns. 

9. Every Money Street report includes your 
checking account name. 

10. Many reports also include detailed sub-totals, in 
this case the monthly sub-totals for code 50. 
Thus you get most of the details needed for 
budgeting, posting, or financial analysis.

WEST COAST COMPUTER ARTIST 
CREATES SPORTS ^^PAINTINGS^^ 



It was nearly one hundred degrees in the 
shade, August 6, 1983, at the Riviera Country 
Club in Pacific Palisades, California. To the 
thousands of golf enthusiasts gathered to 
watch the 1983 PGA Tournament, the weather 
was just perfect. 

Reporters and photographers representing 
all aspects of the media were here for this mo- 
mentus sporting event. Even the Goodyear 
blimp was on hand, sailing serenely overhead 
through the clear blue sky. 

But one exciting story didn't happen on the 
fairways and the greens. In a small tent near 
the tenth hole, a talented and energetic artist 
generated "instant computer art" depicting 
this sporting event. 

The only artist currently re-creating live 
sporting events as computer-enhanced video 
paintings, Joni Carter uses what she calls "a 
one-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar paint 
box." 

Carter's paint box surrounded her at the 
Riviera Country Club that balmy, sweltering 
southern California Saturday. Four video 



monitors displayed the image fed from a tele- 
vision network, her computer's palette, the 
"painting" she was currendy working on, and 
the final video image output. A Sony three- 
quarter-inch video recorder captured each mo- 
ment of play, ensuring that she wouldn't miss 
a portentous putt. The computer, an Aurora 
Imaging System, sat nestled in the corner, 
amid the road cases and cables. 

"What I'm actually doing," Carter ex- 
plains, "is grabbing frames, digitizing the 
video input as the golfers are making their 
shots, and then going back and painting over 
the image with the computer. 

"There are only two types of systems in 
the country of this caliber— the Aurora and the 
MCI/Quantel Paintbox," says Carter. "The 
two are radically different. The Aurora is a 
fabulous system to take on site because it's 
quick and totally dependable." 

At an event like the PGA Tournament, 
some of the final images are sent back out to 
the television network. Other computer paint-

25 YEARS AND

THE RIGHT STUFF 

October marks the 200th anniversary of 
manned flight— on October 15, 1783, French- 
man Jean Pilatre de Rozier made the first cap- 
tive-balloon ascent. October also marks the 
twenty-fifth anniversary of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA), which began operations on October 
1, 1958 — 362 days after the historic launch of 
Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union on October 4, 
1957. 

Since the October 1 1 , 1958, launch of Pio- 
neer 1, a craft that reached a maximum 
altitude of 71,300 miles, NASA has piled up 
an impressive list of accomplishments— from 
planetary probes and Skylab to lunar landings 
and the current space shuttle program. With 
the ninth space shuttle mission — which will 
mark the return of the S.S. Columbia carrying 
Spacelab 1— scheduled to launch on October 
28, this month promises to be a time of nation- 
wide celebration of NASA's achievements. 

NASA may be experiencing pressure from 
competitors— Europe and the private sec- 
tor — and one still hears more about potential 
projects than about those that actually reach 
fruition, but the U.S. government agency has 
earned a pat on the back. 

Throughout the month, public -oriented fes- 
tivities will be held at some of the agency's ten 
field installations. In addition, many special 
celebrations are planned for NASA em- 
ployees. Employees who were with NASA on 
October 1, 1958, will be in the spotlight. 

Tooting its own horn, NASA is par- 
ticipating in the October 16 premiere of the 
new film The Right Stuff— based on Tom 
Wolfe's bestselling book on the early days of 
space flight — and in numerous other projects. 
An hour-long multimedia show recounting 
NASA's achievements will be made available 
to planetariums across the country; a record 
book illuminating NASA's past and future 
plans will be distributed to more than fifty 
thousand science teachers in mid-October; 
and stamp collectors will have a chance to 
purchase some of the two hundred sixty thou- 
sand postal covers carried on the last shuttle 
flight (the covers have a Twenty-fifth Anni- 
versary NASA cancellation mark).

New PBS Series Focuses 
On Educational Computing 



At the dawn of the microcomputer age, it 
Ijecame painfully apparent to most adults that 
the younger generation held the hands-down 
advantage in the computer games department, 
so that arena was reluctantly surrendered. But 
what of educational software and hardware? 
Who decides whether Zaxxon or Math Tutor 
will reign? Will the next generation be capable 
of zapping an alien armada at ten parsecs but 
be baffled by simple sums and long division? 

Not if television has anything to say about 
it. More specifically, not if a new series, Edu- 
cational Computing Profile, beginning in Sep- 
tember on the Public Broadcasting System 
(PBS), has anything to say about it. 

Produced by Kentucky Educational 
Television (KET) in cooperation with the 
Educational Products Information Exchange 
Institute (EPIE), the new series consists of 
nine monthly half-hour segments covering 
developments in the microcomputer field; 
each show also features comparisons and 
evaluations of educational hardware and 
software. 

The series uses a magazine format in 
which each monthly segment is divided into 
three sections: trends and news, interviews 
and commentary, and software and hardware 
evaluations. 

The trends and news section is topical, 
concentrating on new developments in the 
microcomputer industry in general and also 
reporting on new products and bestsellers. 
Timely news, such as stock quotes or govern- 
mental action affecting the industry, is also 
covered in this section. 

The interviews and commentary give de- 
signers, manufacturers, educators, and par- 
ents an opportunity to discuss the major issues 



affecting computer education. The open 
discussion format, according to KET, is 
geared to provide "lively, intelligent, and fre- 
quently conflicting perspectives about the 
changes the computer age has brought." 

The hardware and software evaluations 
segment is also meant to cover "frequently 
conflicting perspectives" in its head-to-head 
comparisons between products. Competing 
products are compared and evaluated on the 
basis of features, storage capacity, expansion 
capability, ease of operation, quality of graph- 
ics, effectiveness of documentation, and 
more. The evaluations section is intended to 
emphasize the information consumers will 
need when buying hardware or software. 

Product evaluation will not be limited to 
any specific hardware brands or types. One of 
the first shows features software for the Apple 
II and Apple II Plus. Later installments will 
feature evaluations of the Atari 800, the TI 
personal computer, and accompanying soft- 
ware. According to a KET spokesperson, 
much of the educational software discussed 
will be for the Apple, "because there's so 
much of it." 

In order to ensure timeliness, the show will 
be taped only two weeks before it's aired, to 
allow coverage of any late-breaking develop- 
ments in the industry. 

EPIE, which is principally responsible for 
the content of the series, is an educational 
products evaluation service and a part of the 
Consumer's Union of the United States, pub- 
lisher of Consumer Reports. Over the past 
year, EPIE has trained and certified more than 
three hundred evaluators throughout the coun- 
try to provide reviews of courseware packages 
and hardware systems. MT 



Old Tariffs May 
Be New Problems 
For Modem Users 

As the breakup of AT&T continues and we 
are left to the tender mercies of local tele- 
phone companies, a not altogether unexpected 
hassle may plague residents of some states us- 
ing personal computers and modems to send 
and receive data. 

The hassle will take the form of higher 
telephone bills resulting from "information 
terminal tariffs"— special telephone rates be- 
gun during the 1960s by some of AT&T's op- 
erating companies for the use of their lines for 
data transmission. 



A case in point was reported in a recent 
edition of the Wall Street Journal. Robert 
Braver, a personal computer owner in Okla- 
homa City, saw his basic monthly telephone 
bill from Southwestern Bell balloon from $9 
to $45.90 when the phone company found out 
he was using a modem. 

The tariffs took effect before the personal 
computer revolution, when only businesses 
were transmitting data by phone. Local 
telephone companies say the rates are higher 
than ordinary residential rates because send- 
ing and receiving data involves heavier use of 
the lines. 

Braver, meanwhile, is organizing a fund- 
raising campaign to mount a legal challenge to 
the tariff, based on the argument that personal 
computer owners use their modems far less 
than a business would. He's making contact 
with potential contributors — via modem, of 
course. DH

High-Techs Seek To Improve 
Southern California Image 



The feeling of a division between north 
and south may not be as intense within the 
state of California as it was nationally, say, at 
the time of the Civil War, but residents of the 
Golden State tend to maintain a fair degree of 
separatist consciousness. Long has southern 
California been seen as the laid-back, vulgar, 
rich, no-account relation by the culturally in- 
clined residents of the sophisticated north. 
Since the advent of the information age and 
the establishment of its high-profile headquar- 
ters in Silicon Valley, the north has added 
high technology to its list of attractions, which 
also include opera, big bridges, year-round 
fog banks, and a subway. 

Far to the south, in Brentwood, California, 
Steve Panzer and Jeff Weiss, partners in the 




Left, Steven Panzer, the force behind the 
Southern California Technology Executives 
Network (SoCalTEN). Right, Walter F. Bauer, 
chairman of SoCalTEN. 

management consulting firm of Panzer Asso- 
ciates, came to a realization. Specializing in 
high-technology companies, they had occa- 
sion to note that 80 percent of all California- 
bound venture capital was finding its way up 
to the northern region, to the dismay and re- 
sentment of the businesses in the south. This 
trend was due to the firm identification of the 
San Francisco Bay Area— in the minds of in- 
vestors, venture capitalists, and loan offi- 
cers—with all things computerized. The folks 
up north had the image and they had the com- 
munity. Everybody knew everybody else. 

After doing a little research, Panzer Asso- 
ciates determined that the southern California 
computer conrniunity's lack of identity and 
visibility is attributable to the fabled Los An- 
geles Syndrome— the general absence of a 
sense of community. Unlike the East Coast 
MIT computer mafia or the Silicon Valley 
old-boy network — where most companies are 
spin-offs of companies down the 
block— southern California's high-tech firms 
are simply too diverse. They have been found- 
ed by people who come from such back- 
grounds as aircraft engineering, electronics, 
show business, telecommunications, and so 



on. However, the fact that there are so many 
different areas of specialization also means 
that there is almost no direct competition 
among firms. Therefore, reasoned Panzer and 
Weiss, getting people together shouldn't be 
too difficult. 

As a beginning, the partners talked to 
twenty-five executives of software companies, 
peripheral and microcomputer manufacturers, 
distributors, and OEMs. They found an inter- 
esting pattern. "For every CEO who raised a 
problem, another CEO had found the solu- 
tion," says Panzer. "Where one CEO was 
weak in marketing, at the same time he was 
strong in financial management. Perhaps the 
most significant finding was that all the CEOs 
taken together had virmally all the solutions." 

And, just as important, "They really 
wanted to talk to us," recalls Weiss. "They 
were eager to hear from someone outside." 

Panzer and Weiss 's idea was to form a net- 
work of information— not to ferret out techno- 
logical trade secrets but to supply help in man- 
aging companies, building relationships in the 
business, and generally increasing the public's 
awareness of southern California as a bustling 
center for high technology. Deciding to go 
farther than Silicon Valley's tight-knit but in- 
formal network, Panzer and Weiss founded 
the Southern California Technology Execu- 
tives Network (SoCalTEN). 

By the first organizational meeting in May, 
the group had the attention of forty-seven area 
companies including Ashton-Tate, Datamost, 
Datasoft, Edu-Ware, Micro/Sys, Callan Data, 
Corona, and Axiom. At the first official 
meeting in July, more than a hundred com- 
panies were represented. At that gathering, 
two venture capitalists and the CEOs of two 
fast-growing companies delivered keynote 
speeches on dealing with marketing problems. 
Then the meeting broke up into round-table 
discussions. 

Now, by providing a monthly summary of 
information from management, technical, and 
market sources, a schedule of network con- 
ferences and seminars, and a membership 
resource directory, SoCalTEN is helping to 
remove the proverbial chip from southern 
California's high-tech shoulder. 

Having focused initially on the western 
portion of the San Fernando Valley— where 
many computer peripheral manufacturers are 
concentrated— SoCalTEN now covers all of 
Los Angeles County and has plans to draw 
Orange County firms into the network soon. 

Panzer Associates is continuing its re- 
search, in an effort to "identify the critical 
factors in the management of rapid growth and 
marketing strategies," says Panzer. "We are 
exploring the possibility of a 'corporate 
university' — a place where executives and 
managers could learn fi-om the seasoned lead- 
ers, and where we could all learn from each 
other." AC

ings may be patiently modified, pixel by pix- 
el, until Carter is ready to convert them to 
hard copy. These latter works become either 
gallery pieces or limited-edidon prints. Carter 
produced a limited series of paintings from 
this year's PGA Tournament. 

"If I'm creating a piece of artwork that I 
definitely want to reproduce for a gallery, 
then obviously I give myself a great deal more 
time," she explains. "If I'm creating artwork 
for broadcast on television, that's something 
entirely different."

A self-taught artist who has sold numerous 
pieces of art — including lithographs and silk- 
screens, as well as computer paintings— Car- 
ter looks upon the technology she now em- 
ploys as a tool for creative expression. 
"These systems are really more for the artist 
than for the technician; they're very simple to 
use." 

Carter, using a graphics tablet, can adjust 
the luminance and hue levels of a single color, 
producing hundreds of shades of that color. 
The system Carter uses also enables her to 
achieve multiple shades of flesh tones with 



OCTOBER 1983 



relative ease. 

"When I used to paint, I would sit for 
hours mixing litde dabs of paint. There might 
be seventy-five shades of color in a face. The 
computer will give you the same range of col- 
ors instantly." 

You'd have to buy a lot of paint to equal 
the total number of colors possible on the Au- 
rora's color palette, an astronomical sixteen 
million. 

Carter's portfolio of "Instant Replays" of 
major sporting events includes the Major 
League Baseball play-off aired on ABC last 
October. "There, I worked ten days live, 
hooked up via satellite to both the National 
and the American League games." 

Carter has also created on-the-spot art for 
display on Dodger Stadium's Diamond Vision 




screen. And she has done "instant computer 
art" for the NFL and the NBA, as well as for 
marathons, such as San Francisco's Bay to > 
Breakers '82 race. 

Working with television live on location i 
poses its own unique problems. The bright 
sunlight reflecting off her monitors makes them i 
difficult to read and, as in all live productions, 
timing is critical. Some of Carter's paintings ; 
have had to be digitized, touched up, and 
ready to air in less than three minutes. "The 
last time I worked for ABC," Carter recalls, 
"they just broadcast the paintings alone. They 






didn't use them for bumpers, backdrops, or 
logos. They used them as pieces of art at the 
end of every inning during the baseball play- 
offs." 

Carter created more than 220 pieces of art 
during the play-offs and ABC used about sev- 
enty-five of the paintings. In the last game of 
the National League play-offs, ABC finished 
the broadcast with her portrait of Ted Turner, 
owner of the defeated Atlanta Braves. 

Working with television has offered Carter 
many opportunities for creative experimenta- 
tion, not just in the direct broadcast of her 
computer paintings. 

"When I first discovered the computer, 
one of the things I started creating was hard 
copy as artwork. I sold prints to some of the 
studios for use on a variety of sets. 

"It was a fabulous experience," recalls 
Carter. "Art directors and set decorators 
would say, 'Joni, we've got a set that needs 
some flower designs. These are the col- 
ors. . . .'I would run over to the computer 
and create some bizarre flower designs. Then 
the AD [art director] would come back at the 
last minute and we would play around with the 
designs and the colors. We might get twenty- 
five different pictures from that one design." 

Carter uses a process that results in a Sepi- 
chrome print, which bears more resemblance 
to an oil painting than it does to a conventional 
computer printout. The process involves using 
a special computer camera, which takes a di- 
rect RGB signal in and converts it into

thirty-five-millimeter slides. The slides are 
then made into prints by a local graphics print- 
ing firm. 

A problem Carter faces from time to time 
is equipment incompatibility. "You can do the 
greatest piece of artwork in the world on the 
computer. Then it comes time to hook up the 
computer camera and it doesn't work. You 
wind up with a not so good print. Sometimes 
you're fighting technology the whole way." 

With the aid of her sister, Kate Richard- 
son, who is vice president of Carter's com- 
pany, and Aurora engineer Todd Hitzeroth, 
Carter is currently involved in a major project 
at the Museum of Science and Industry in Los 
Angeles, her base of operation. The group is 
preparing what is expected to be the world's 
largest hands-on computer graphics dis- 
play—featuring graphics generated on a host 
of different computers— from Apples and 
Ataris to Auroras and Quantels— that will be 
simple enough for children (and even adults) 
to use. 

Also in the works are plans for the 1984 
Summer Olympics. Carter intends to have pic- 
tures from all the Olympic sites transmitted to 
the museum as the events take place. She also 
plans to paint a special series of Olympic 
scenes for display on monitors throughout the 
museum. HAS

cently, the University of Perth announced the 
development of a robot that can shear 80 per- 
cent of a sheep's body with the help of what 
developers are calling Software Sheep. A pro- 
gram tells the robot— an industrial robotic arm 
normally used for welding — how to guide the 
shearing razor over the body contours of an 
average sheep. To compensate for the individ- 
ual peculiarities of a sheep, the automated sys- 
tem takes different body measurements of the 
sheep before the animal reaches the robot. 
Also, sensors on the robot arm provide a 
warning if the razor head gets too close to the 
sheep's skin. Researchers have yet to program 
the robot to shear the more sensitive parts of a 
sheep, the head in particular. Also, the robot 
works about a tenth as fast as an experienced 
human shearer. Developers of the system say 
it will be another ten years before the system 
is available commercially. 
□ Eighty-Five Years Later and Finally a 
Better Mousetrap. So you thought you knew 
all about RAMS and CPM. Well, you may be 
in for a surprise. RAMS (Rodent Activity 
Monitoring System), offered by Ace Pest 
Control (Culver City, CA), is the key element 
in a computerized service called CPM (Com- 
mercial Pest Management). Designed for 
businesses that normally have problems with 
insects, rodents, and other pests, RAMS auto- 
mates the routine job of checking traps. Con- 
ventional trapping devices, such as snap traps, 
glue boards, and Ketch-Alls, are housed in a 
protected monitoring device, which is con- 




nected to a digital "activity transmitter." 
Whenever a trap is disturbed or sprung, the 
activity transmitter sends a message to a cen- 
tral computer at Ace Pest Control. An Ace 
technician then empties the traps and records 
in a CPM report such information as the date, 
infestation, location, and type of pesticide 
used in each part of a building. This informa- 
tion is kept in the central computer, providing 
a jjermanent log of a company's pest control 
program. According to Ace, trends become 
immediately evident. The idea is to identify 
trouble areas and follow through with preven- 
tive measures. Mickey and Minnie, consider 
yourselves forewarned.

Service Satellite Consortium (PSSC) is hold- 
ing its eighth annual conference and exposi- 
tion October 18—21 at the Washington Hilton 
Hotel, in the nation's capital. The first day's 
program is aimed at lending officers, banks, 
insurance companies, venture capitalists, 
public service organizations, and other in- 
terested investors. The conference will also 
look at direct broadcast satellites, satellite 
teleconferencing, launch risks, recent disas- 
ters and how they can be prevented, and new 
satellite systems. Contact the PSSC in Wash- 
ington. D.C., for details. 

□ SM (Science Museums) and Ex-Slaugh- 
terhouses. In the mid-seventies, a large multi- 
story abattoir on the northern edge of Paris 
was built but never put into operation; new 
meat-processing and transportation techniques 
made the facility obsolete before it was com- 
pleted. So, the French government decided to 
convert the unused slaughterhouse into a na- 
tional science museum. The museum proj- 
ect—the National Museum of Science, 
Technology and Industry of the Park of la Vil- 
lette— was initiated in the late seventies and is 
scheduled to be completed in 1986. The 
museum will feature four basic sections— la- 
beled exploring, using and producing, living 
and inhabiting, and communication — and a 
total of twenty themes, everything from the 
human brain and the transformation of matter 
to computers and the relationship between the 
arts and the sciences. 

□ A Different Kind of Synthesizer. Anyone 
who owns an Apple and is doing research- 
scale peptide synthesis may want to check out 
the Coupler 1000 from Vega Biotechnologies 
(Tucson, AZ). The Coupler 1000 costs a little 
under twenty thousand dollars and is con- 
trolled by an Apple lie. The Coupler 1000 fea- 
tures "fill-in-the-blanks" synthesis software, 
a cross-contamination-free chemistry module, 
chemically inert plumbing, and interchange- 
able reaction vessels. 

□ CADI and Diabetics. As early as this fall, 
diabetics will have the opportunity to purchase 
a hand-held computer that will assist in pre- 
scribing the proper dosages of insulin on a 
day-to-day basis. CADI, computer-assisted 
diabetic instruction, is currently being de- 
veloped at the University of Alabama in Birm- 
ingham 's Diabetic Research and Education 
Hospital. Diabetics will spend a week in the 
hospital to see how they respond to different 
foods and control insulin doses. The test re- 
sults obtained will be fed into a database and 
programmed into participants' hand-held 
computers. Patients will have twenty-four- 
hour-a-day access to the hospital's database 
via telecommunications. Only two diabetics 
are in the CADI program now, but twenty- 
five are expected by year's end. Through 
more efficient blood sugar control, CADI de- 
velopers say, diabetics can have a more flexi- 
ble lifestyle. □!

PRINTER BUFFER: 

MKROBUFFER 1 1 ■!■ 




Pictured here, our Microbulfef 11+ , with features to complement ttie Apple" 
Computers Just one model m ttieluli line ot Microbulters designee) to 
accomodate virtually every computer/printer combination 



Like all Microbuffer models, the 
Microbuffer II -I- eliminates waiting 
for your printer to finish before you can 
use your computer again. It allows you to 
print and process simultaneously. 

But the Microbuffer 11+ has one unique 
quality not found in any other Microbuffer: 
it can be used with virtually any printer- 
serial or parallel, or both at once! 

If you have an Apple II, II -I- , Il/e and 
more than one printer, Microbuffer II -I- 
can eliminate a tremendous bottleneck. 

While your parallel printer is going at 
full speed, your serial printer can be 
printing the same file or a different file 
right along with it. And you can be using 
the Apple to do something else at the 
same time. 

The Microbuffer II -I- printer interface 
will fully support the Apple He 80-column 
format. And it allows an 80-column screen 
dump from the Videx 80-column board in 
your Apple II or II -I- . 

Perhaps, best of all, Microbuffer IH- is 
versatile and smart. It supports over 30 
commands for text formatting, sending 
printer controls, printing screen dumps and 
setting up the Mil -I- itself. AND it in- 
cludes graphics print routines for nine 
popular printers as weU as 8 additional 
graphics printing commands. Whether you 
have 1 printer or 2, Microbuffer gives you 
the maximum amount of printing flexibility 
in the minimum amount of time. 

The new Microbuffer 11+ is available 
now in 16K, 32K, and 64K models. Ask 
yovir dealer for a demonstration, or for 
further information.

STORY-TALK F- I CT- I ON 



Mm 

BY JOHN MASTELLARO 



^Jt was luck. Some people say that the best pilots have the best luck, 
but this pilot could only curse himself for letting the enemy plane slide in 
on his tail. There was no time at all for any smugness in having caught 
that fleeting glance as the silver jet slid across his rearview mirror. There 
was about one second to make a decision. 

He tucked his feet in, jerked the stick back with his left hand while the 
right pulled hard on the eject ring. The last thing he saw before things 
went black was his jet exploding beneath him. 

James Bartlett climbed out of the booth with a smile on his face. He 
had just become the only person to beat the F-16 arcade game 
anywhere, anytime. Never had there been an arcade game as 
sophisticated and realistic, with its precisely simulated cockpit and three- 
dimensional projection dome. After hundreds of attempts, James had 
flown his air cover mission, destroyed three tanks, shot down seven 
planes, and still "lived" to tell about it. All this at the age of seventeen. 
Visions of appearing on national talk shows danced in his head until his 
girlfriend, Carol, forced her way through the crowd and came running 
over to throw her arms around him. The kiss she planted on his lips 
brought James to gasping for air. The arcade owner waited patiently with 
the certificate in hand, and everyone laughed while James struggled to 
extend one arm to accept the award. He was swimming in the euphoria of 
the moment. The ten years he'd spent working the arcade games had 
finally paid off in a big way. He was the best. 

It took a long time to wind down. That night, James took Carol out 
and they celebrated. And celebrated. And when they went to the 
beach later that night, they celebrated some more. Lying beneath 
the stars, James held his girl and thought about the most exhilarating day 
of his life. It couldn't get any better. 

A week later, James was back in the arcades and found himself forced 
to sign autographs between sessions. He wasn't ready to fly again; so he 
just relaxed with some of the more primitive games. One of his favorites 
was Dresden-Blitz. He didn't notice when one of his friends, Scott Ken- 
ny, slid up to the booth next to his. Scott played for a litde while, then 
abruptly blurted out. "Cathy just ditched me," he said, slamming his 



hand on the console. 

James jerked his head up, startled. He glanced over to Scott, but had 
nothing to say to the outburst. 

"We had a fight. It's all over," Scott said grimly. 

James watched Scott play for a few seconds and it was obvious that 
his friend's timing was considerably off. James let his own fighter splat- 
ter into the mountains and began to watch Scott coldly, waiting. He had 
never seen his friend so upset. 

"You really don't give a shit, do you," Scott said. 

"I just splattered my quarter all over the countryside so I could 
listen." 

"What a friend. One splashed jet for the downtrodden." Sarcasm 
dripped from Scott's voice. 

"I'm listening, okay? And I'll loan you another quarter to replace the 
one you're about to blow. What else can I do?" 

"Okay, Mister Ace. Cathy is gone. My car is busted. If I don't get 
married, I get drafted. And you stand there and tell me the best you can 
do is toss me another quarter. Okay. So toss me that quarter and go 
home. Don't forget to buy a frame for your certificate." 

James just shook his head. He could think of no response, so he left. 

When he got home, his parents were in the living room watching 
the television screen intently. Only his mother saw him come 
in, but she scarcely noticed him. The president was looking ex- 
traordinarily sober and pointing to a map of the Near East. James 
watched for only a second because something smelled good coming from 
the kitchen, so he detoured through, sniffed the pots, and grabbed a 
cookie. He went to his room and flopped onto his bed to wait for dinner. 
Lying there, he watched his model airplanes, suspended from the ceiling 
on threads, twist in the air currents from the open window. The evening 
sun flickered and played on the walls as the light passed through the trees 
outside his window. It was a great June evening and life was good. James 
counted his blessings. He'd graduated from high school in May with 
passable grades, and he was looking forward to going to the university 
with Carol. He had earned enough prize money to pay his tuition. His 



308 



OCTOBER 1983 



ordeal in the F-16 didn't get him on the talk shows, but he'd been inter- 
viewed by the local news in Los Angeles. He did worry about Scott a lit- 
tle, and Scott's plight with Cathy made him feel a little guilty. Suddenly, 
his musings were interrupted. 

"James? Can you come down?" his mother called from the stairwell. 
"Your father and I want to speak with you." 

He pulled himself out of bed and skipped down the stairs. There was 
undue concern in his mother's voice, and James became apprehensive. 
When he came into the living room, the television was off. That was a 
bad sign. He sat down and noticed that his father did not appear to be act- 
ing normal either. There was coldness and evasion in his father's eyes 
and tears in his mother's. His father held out a letter to him and walked 
away with his head down when James took it. James Bartlett looked at 
the envelope. It was from the Selective Service. He didn't need to read 
the letter inside to know what the problem was. 

There were good things about West Germany, but most things 
were bad. The weather was terrible. Instead of being bright and 
cool in October like his San Diego home, it was cold and drizzly. 
The barracks were communal and always cold. There was no place to go 
unless one considered Kitzingen the bright spot of the world. What most 
filled his life was mud. The tanks drove in it. He walked in it. He sat in 
it. The barracks always had it on the floor. Only the insides of the tanks 
were free of it by virtue of the fanatical care of the tank crews. His life 
consisted of wind and water and mud. 

The redeeming virtue of being in Kitzingen was that no one was 
shooting at him, which wasn't the case with his unfortunate brethren 
pinned down in the desert a few thousand kilometers away. James was 
beginning to hope he could serve out his time as an M-1 tank driver and 
be done with it. 

At first he thought about Carol a lot. He had dreadful images of her 
sitting in tight shorts on a grasy knoll at the university waiting for some 
lucky fellow to come along and invite her to his room. He soon realized 
that such thoughts weren't helping him get through the mess he was in. 
Carol had said she would wait, so James forced himself to stop worrying 



about her and eventually decided that perhaps he'd fall in love with the 
blonde Fraulein who served beer at the base NCO club. 

After James had spent three weeks struggling to drive a tank (through 
mud) without dropping a track, his platoon sergeant, Fred Hammond, 
called him into his office. 

"Bartlett? What are we going to do with you?" 

"What do you mean, sir?" 

"How long is it gonna take you to learn tank driving? Leaving your 
busted tracks in mud holes is frowned on, son. Didn't you learn anything 
at Knox?" 

"I'm trying, sir. I just need more practice. Alone." 

"Ha! We don't have time for that crap. In case you forgot, there's a 
war going on. We need people who can learn together as a team. 
Anyway. We're short of gunners now. I think you've had enough driv- 
ing. I hear you were a pretty hot shot in the arcades." 

"I guess so," James said quietly. 

"Speak up, Bartlett!" 

"I don't want to be a gunner. Sir." 

"No matter. What you want isn't important now. We need gunners 
real bad, and that's all there is to it. I've already made arrangements with 
your tank commander. Gunnery practice at 1400 tomorrow." 

"Is that all?" 

"Hell no! You will show up at the motor pool tomorrow morning to 
wash down tanks and drive them to the airfield. Be there at 0800. And 
Bartlett. Try to shoot better than you drive. We need some good gunners 
in this army." 

James sat at a table by himself in the NCO club and sipped a tep- 
id beer. The air was filled with smoke and alcohol. The crowd 
was amazing. Behind him, some other privates were jostling each 
other around an arcade machine playing Battle Zone and laughing. James 
didn't feel at all like dropping a coin in the box. He spent a lot of time in- 
stead watching Fraulein Schmidt and staring into his beer. He looked up 
from his glass to see his tank commander spot him and walk toward his 
table. Staff Sergeant DeVigeo pulled up a chair.

"You don't look so good, Bartlett," he said. 
"So what else is new?" 

"I'm told you're going to be my gunner now." 
"Wasn't my idea." James took another sip of his beer. 
"I know you'll do a good job." 

"If they'll give me some time to practice," Bartlett said, "I may be 
able to." 

"Well, don't take too long. Word has it that we may not be here 
much longer. Get good while you can." 

Suddenly the picture came into focus for James. West Germany had 
been the cream, not the dregs. No more Saturday nights in Frankfurt, no 
more getting looped during the Oktoberfest and grabbing the Frauleins, 
no more driving tanks around in the nice, safe mud. Things were not 
looking up. He never did remember what happened the rest of that night. 

The light was blinding. James was hot and sweating. He peered 
into the sight and strained to see over the next sandy hill. He 
knew the enemy was there. How he knew, he didn't know. But he 
was ready. The round was loaded. At eleven hundred meters, the shell 
would take less than a second to impact. He tensed and danced his finger 
over the trigger. He wouldn't hesitate when the dark shape rose up. 
Simply squeeze and cross off another enemy tank. 

But the enemy never appeared. James waited. And waited. Then 
there was an incredible blast. He was thrown to the tank floor like a rag 
doll and flames appeared everywhere. He couldn't breathe. He couldn't 
hear. He knew he was going to die, trapped in a metal inferno. He 
thought of his parents. He thought of Carol. He struggled to open the 
hatch, but it seared his hand and wouldn't budge. James Bartlett died. 

Then he opened his eyes. The barracks was very still. A single 
lamppost cast a pale white light on the foot of his bed. It was 
snowing lightly, and James was cold. He shivered and tried to 
slow his breathing. He pulled the covers up and lay there thinking. 



It had been pretty much the same dream the past two months. 
Sometimes he won, and there was great glory. Carol drifted in and out of 
those. Sometimes he lost, as in this one. Sometimes when he dreamed 
about dying, he thought about deserting. But he knew he couldn't do 
that. He was the Ace. 

He looked at his watch. Four in the morning. At eight his plane 
would leave for the Near East with a refueling stop in Istanbul. Still 
shaking, he got up and dressed. 

They found him at the PX Laundromat glued to the Tail Gunner 
arcade game. He had rolled up a record score in four hours on a 
single coin. Sergeant DeVigeo had to physically remove James 
from the console, pump a cup of coffee down him, and virtually carry 
him to the C- 141. James said nothing all the way to the airfield. 
Once in the air, DeVigeo started to talk to him. 
"Better wake up, son. I hear we're getting the crap beat out of us 
down there. This is no time to freeze up." 
"I can handle it," James said very slowly. 
"Anything I can do?" said the sergeant. 
"Just remember to call me Ace." 
"Okay, Ace. We'll kick their butts, huh?" 
"What happens when we land?" 

"We form up with the rest of the company and drive our tanks to the 
front. There won't be much time to waste." 

"Will we be shot at right away?" James said, shaking a little. 
"Yes." 

eing in a tank in the desert is like taking a tour in an oven. The 
dust was choking. The smell and the noise were almost unbear- 
able. James added to the smell by being unable to unbutton a hatch 
and throw up outside. His platoon had been in the desert all aftemon, dug 
in and cooking. Suddenly, DeVigeo was yelling at him. The loader was 
yelling at him. James rose up with a start, hitting his head against the in-

wouldn't work right. DeVigeo yelled at him some more, and this time he 
could make him out. 

"Smoke clouds at 020! Get on the flir and load armor piercing!" 
DeVigeo yelled into the intercom. 

James never cared for the flir because its imaging was poor. He looked 
into the visual sight and switched to wide field-of-view. Momentarily, 
the ominous row of T-80s rumbled out of the clouds. James saw a TOW 
zoom by and quickly switched to narrow field-of-view, as he tweaked the 
turret to bear on one of the tanks. 

"They're here! Nail somebody, Bartlett!" 

James slewed the reticle onto the vague-looking target barely visible 
through the swirling dust. There was no time to tell anyone or worry 
about the fact that the laser had stopped working. He wiped more blood 
from his eye, estimated the range, and squeezed off the round in panic. It 
missed. The loader had another round in immediately. James went back 
to the reticle just in time to see a muzzle flash from the enemy tank and 
realize that it was aiming at him. A second later, his tank was enveloped 
in a deafening roar and James was rocked from his position. Struggling, 
he got his eye back to the eyepiece, but the turret was offset, and he had 
to slew back onto the target. While he centered the cross hair, it dawned 
on him that this guy in the other tank was trying to kill him. James froze 
for a second while he thought about that, then he pulled the trigger again. 
He never saw if the round hit. 

It was a sunny day in February as James Bartlett walked along the 
campus pathway between the business and math buildings. The 
sky was high and blue and breezy. The trees rustled lightly in the 
wind. It was a good day to be alive, even without a right arm to carry 
books. James wrestled his backpack off with his left arm and sat down on 
a cement bench in front of the business building. The student traffic was 
heavy, and an occasional passerby stared at his arm. The next time he 
looked up, his old friend Scott was standing before him. 

"Back from the wars?" Scott said, looking uncomfortably at the 
shoulder where James's missing arm used to be. 
"Yeah. Back for good." 
"How are we doing?" 
"We're losing pretty bad." 

Scott looked puzzled. "What do you mean, man? I figured we'd go 
over there and clean up on those guys." 

"Want to go? I can get you signed up easy," James said. 
"No way. Cathy and I are getting married. I'm hanging onto my con- 
scientious objector status in the meantime. Besides, I think the war 
stinks. Who gives a damn about the East?" 

"Getting shot at stinks," James said. 

"Well, you shouldn't have gone," Scott said as he watched a coed 
walk by. 

"I shouldn't have gotten my crew killed either." 
"What happens now?" Scott asked. 

James shrugged. "I suppose I'll get my bachelor's in business. Try to 
find a job. Try to find a girl with a fetish for one-armed guys." 
"What about Carol?" 

"She doesn't have any fetishes," James said. 

"Well, good luck," Scott said, trying not to look at the stump. 

"So go play house." 

James walked home after class, down the main drag, to his apart- 
ment. All the students he saw seemed so young. The arcade 
shops, one every few hundred yards, were teeming with students. 
He stopped and looked in the window of one to watch the frenzy. A girl 
with her back to him, who might have been Carol, was arm in arm with 
a tall fellow. The lights flashed and the speakers crackled with the sound 
of phasers and cannons and crashing ships. James struggled with his left 
arm to reach into his pocket for a quarter, found one, and held it tightly. 
He stood and watched with his hand clenched around the quarter. 

When he saw that the girl was not Carol, he continued his slow walk 
home. Presently, he saw an old man squatting in front of a Salvation 
Army store with a metal cup in his hand. James walked up to the ragged- 
ly dressed man, pulled the quarter out of his pocket, and started to drop 
it into the cup. Then he stopped and angrily, with a jerky motion of his 
left arm, threw it as far as he could into an empty lot. James Bartlett, ex- 
Ace, invited the man to his apartment for dinner. 31

Softalk Presents Hie Bestsellers 



Maybe Parisians have the right idea. They take August off. Everyone 
goes on holiday for the month. 

It isn't as if August were a month that only Father Time could love. 
There are a few others who could bask enjoyably in the hot summer sim. 
But for the most part, August sales were as flat as week-old 7-Up. A 
graph of July and August sales would make the Bonneville Salt Flats look 
like the Alps. Software was selling with all the elan of bug- 
gy whips. 

It wasn't just software that suffered. Apple lie sales flattened out 
also. In some parts of the country, August was the first time since the 
introduction of the He when it and all its usual peripherals were in plen- 
tiful supply. August suffered from a shortage of buyers. 

Nobody's pushing the panic button, inasmuch as August isn't one of 
your prime retailing months in the first place. But when June and July 
showed unexpected strength, there had been hopes for a better August 
as well. 

For all of August's shortcomings, it was a pretty good month for 
some folks. 

Lord British managed to set some kind of record in August, although 
its merit is somewhat dubious. Under his own Origin Systems imprima- 
tur. Lord British released Ultima III to hot demand. It barely hit the 
stores in August, but the early copies were snapped up in enough 
strength to push the program onto the Top Thirty in its first month of 
release. That's unusual, but it's not a record. 

The record comes when you look at the Fantasy 5 listing. There re- 
side three programs— all C//rima— written by Lord British and each pub- 
fished by a different publisher. It's the first and, most probably, the last 
time that one author has placed three programs on the Bestseller lists 
with three different publishers. 

One can assume that now that he's self-published. Lord British will 
be content with his present publisher. In which case, he can probably 
retire the trophy for "Most Publishers Active in his Behalf." 

He certainly won't be able to duplicate the feat next month. The 
original Ultima will almost surely be displaced by Sir-tech's Legacy of 
Llylgamyn, fmally hitting the stores in mid-September after unexplained 
delays. Llylgamyn has the look of a third Wizardry hit for Andrew 
Greenberg and Robert Woodhead. The duo will probably duplicate Lord 
British's feat of having three programs on the Fantasy 5 list; but they al- 
ways publish through Sir-tech, so they'll never lay claim to the most pub- 
lishers title. 

Another who prospered in August was Sophie, the beagle of Beagle 
Bros fame. As exposed elsewhere in this issue, Sophie is really the brains 
behind Beagle Bros and Bert Kersey is her front man. You can't argue 
with success, however; and Sophie sure has an abundance of that.

For the second consecutive month, there are seven Beagle Bros pro- 
grams on the Hobby 10 list. The astonishing thing is that this month's 
seven aren't just last month's seven repeated. Some dropped out and 
others jumped in to take their place. That's a depth of product that other 
software (dog?) houses would love to exhibit. 

The gravy on Sophie's dog biscuit is the fact that Kersey's whimsical 
and modest Beagle Bag outsold all but a handful of arcade glitterers to

SPARE CHANGE You are the game-happy owner 

of the Spare Change Arcade. Two fun-loving, but ovenworked 
Zerks — the main characters in your most popular game — have bro- 
ken loose and are trying to retire from the business. You try madly to 
stop them. If you can get a coin into the juke box, the Zerks get so 
caught up in the music, they drop everything and start dancing. You 
also try popping popcorn and making a pay phone ring— which 
immediately makes the Zerks stop, answer and start a wild con 
versation. If you "win" the game, 
there are rib tickling cartoons by 
the Zerks to reward your efforts. 
It's a game full of sight gags, 
surprises and comedy From the 
best. Br0derbund! For the 
Apple® II, II + and lie. Coming 
soon for the Atari® home 
computers in disk format.

own games. Without any knowledge of programming, you can easily

rank well up on the Arcade 10 list. Heaven help VisiCalc if Kersey de- 
cides to publish a fun spreadsheet. 

The success of Beagle Bros actually bolstered interest in other Hobby 
10 products as well. Bag of Tricks, that long-runner from Quality Soft- 
ware, not only resurfaced, but came in strong enough to score on the Top 
Thirty as well. Penguin scored with two graphics packages and 
Phoenix's Zoom Grafix regained a list that grew beyond ten entries be- 
cause of ties. 

Spinnaker Software also fared well as August closed out their first 
year as suppliers in the home education market. Three of their proA- 
ucts—Facemaker, Snooper Troops I , and Delta Drawing — scored in the 
Education 10 list. The eleventh and twelfth programs. Story Machine 
and Snooper Troops II, were also from Spinnaker. That's an astounding 
performance in an area that's become one of the most competitive soft- 
ware markets. 

Of course, MasterType continued to lead the category, with Apple 
Logo and Compw/er 5/1 7 following in reverse order from last month. The 
major change was the appearance on the list of DLM's Arcademic Skill 
Builders in Math, which made fifth place on the Education 10 list. 

Another company that didn't seem affected by the August doldrums 
was Infocom. With monotonous regularity, they've been grabbing four 
of the five positions on the Adventure 5 list. August was no different. 
Zork I, granddaddy of the clan, remained the top adventure. 

It would have been a clean sweep for Infocom had not Death in the 
Caribbean grabbed its second consecutive third-place finish. Micro 
Fun's new graphic adventure prevented Zork III from making the list.

OCTOBER 1983 



31 



August was a particularly tough month on strategy game sales. Top 
sellers sold fewer copies than in previous months and far fewer titles 
overall were moved through retail channels. 

Flight Simulator wrested the lead in the Strategy 5 category from 
Castle Wolfenstein, which dropped to third. Spitfire Simulator, an ir- 
regular performer, had a comparatively strong August and jumped into 
second. Two chess programs finished off the category— 5argon // and 
Chess 7. 0. The October introduction of Sargon III should bring that 
competition into clearer focus. 

Another depressed area was the home market. Sales were off 
throughout the category, and, as with the Strategy 5, far fewer titles 
received any kind of mention. Home Accountant continued its dominance 
of the Home 10, which changed little from last month. 

Sales of business products held about even, with strength in account- 
ing packages offsetting weaknesses in some other areas. 

VisiCalc remains the leader and continues to maintain its distance 
from its most direct competitor— A/M/ftp/an. PFS.File continues as run- 
ner-up in the category to VisiCalc and is still holding off third-place 
Quick File He for top honors among the filing programs. 

Ashton-Tate's dBase //is outdistancing other database managers by a 
wide margin. The BPI accounting series, sold by Apple, remains the 
choice for accounting, with three modules in the Business 10. State of the 
Art's packages and Accounting Plus are both mounting challenges. 

It was business as usual at the top of the Word Processing 10 chart, 
but there were a couple of minor surprises in the lower half of the list.

Ba^ of Tricks 

By Don Worth and Pieter Lechner 



Requires Apple II, Apple II Plus, or Apple lie 
with 48K RAM and one disk drive 



TM 




From the authors of the best selling book BENEATH APPLE DOS 
comes BAG OF TRICKS — fourcomprehensive utility programs on 
diskette and many more pages of valuable information about the 
Apple H's disk operating system. 

BAG OF TRICKS is useful to beginners and experienced program- 
mers alike. It includes many "hand holding" tutorials that assist 
you in repairing damaged diskettes and allov^/you to change sector 
ordering, reconstruct b\owr\ catalogs, etc. etc. etc. At the iov^^ 
price of $39.95, BAG OF TRICKS is one of the best software 
values ever. 

The four programs and their functions are: 

1. TRAX dumps and examines a raw track, either 13-sector 
or 16-sector, displays the internal Apple diskette 
formatting information, and flags exceptions to 
standard formats. 

2 INIT will reformat one or more tracks, attempting to 
preserve the contents of undamaged sectors. It also 
allows you to change sector order. This can cut disk access 
times by 40% or more! 

3. ZAP is a sector editor like no other' More than 50 commands 
are available to assist you to locate, compare, change, or 
print the data on your diskettes. ZAP is even programmable' 
Using powerful macros, it is possible to transfer and 
compare DOS, CP/M, or PASCAL files. 

4. FIXCAT automates the process of repairing a damaged 
diskette catalog. It operates with or without user inter- 
vention, locating "lost" files and rebuilding the catalog — 
from scratch if necessary! DOS removal and VTOC repair 
are also possible

on hard times when the lie came out. It scrambled its way back to 
seventh on the list and may be ready for another surge such as the one it 
enjoyed late in 1982. 

The tightest contest for supremacy was in the Arcade 10 category, 
where only a handful of units separated Lode Runner from second-place 
Zaxxon. Overall sales of arcade games also slipped significantly, al- 
though about the same number of titles remained active in the market. 

Electronic Arts has yet to have its first big winner, but it's doing okay 
in the meantime. Hard Hat Mack came in fifth. The Last Gladiator 
scored ninth, and Axis Assassin was eleventh. In addition, they share dis- 



Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 5 .1 percent of all sales of Apple 
and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in September to ascertain their sales for the month of 
August. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold— such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and personal preferences of 
the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in September represented every geographical area of the continental United 
States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index number 
to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an arbitrary 
measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correlative only to the 
month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index rating of 50 in one 
month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 3.72 percent, which translates roughly into 
the theoretical possibility of a change of 4.03 points, plus or minus, in any index number.

Accounting was also big on the Apple III in August. Three modules 
of Great Plains accounting software made the top ten, as the North Da-

Writer III remained the leader, with VisiCalc: Advanced Version in sec- 
ond place. HI
