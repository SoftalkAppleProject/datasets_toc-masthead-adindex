Learn To Type™ 

If you don't learn to type, you'll be left behind 
by the computer revolution. But if your children 
never learn, the consequences will be worse. 

When we developed Learn To Type, we made it 
as easy and unintimidating as possible. In fact, the 
beginning section of Learn To Ty'pe assumes you've 
never touched a keyboard before. 

The program uses prompts to help you, and 
has a drill and practice section that rates you on 
words per minute, telling you which fingers are 
slow and which are fast. You can even test your 
progress with the fun to play game. Eraser Man!" 
Kids love it! 

Plus you've got a choice of the keyboard layout 
you want to learn to type from — DVORAK or 
QWERTY 

Don't be left behind. Get Learn To Type.

CONTEST 

Computeytoons 




Computers and the computer industry are 
exciting, expansive, explosive (figuratively, 
usually), competitive, and ingenious. Some- 
times computers and the computer industry can 
be funny. 

We like funny. We want your ideas of 
what's funny in the computer world. We want 
you to submit pen-and-ink cartoons, like those 
in the editorial pages of your newspaper. Like 
those for which you read the New Yorker. Like 
those that made Oliphant a household name. If 
you're artistic, give us art; if you're not, give us 
minimalism. The pictures are the least of it 
when it comes to cartooning; we're looking for 



brevity, sophistication, and clarity, a blend of 
humor and commentary to grace the pages of 
Contest Winners. The 'toons should be at least 
obliquely related to computers. 

Send us your three best attempts at com- 
puteytoons, drawn in black ink on three sepa- 
rate pieces of plain white paper. Computer- 
drawn entries are okay if they're printed in 
black. You have until September 15, 1984, to 
submit your work. Specify the dream software 
(from Softalk' s advertisers) that you covet, and 
send the whole hysterical package to Softalk

"T.A.C. is a carefully researched and designed ganne of 
innpressive sopliistication, yet it's surprisingly easy to play 
and even a little addicting." — Softalk 

"Gameofthie Month"— Byte: February, 1984 

"I've developed this aversion for computer games— until 
T.A.C. I can play this game and like it— lots!" 
Gameplay Magazine 

"It's the best simulation of tank warfare this reviev^/er has 
seen on or off a computer screen ." — Electronic Games 

T.A.C. is a game of World War II tactical armored 
combat. You pick a nation (from among the four major 
combatants — Britain, U.S.A., Germany and Russia). You 
build a combat team from their most powerful tanks, 
assault guns and tank destroyers. You command the 
team you've created in major operations against like 
forces of the enemy, 

All the famous vehicles of the second world war are 
here — Tigers, Panthers, Shermans and JS H's; Jagdpan- 
thers, SU 162's, Fireflies and T 34's, just to name a few. 
They have all been thoroughly researched and their 
important features programmed into the game. Each 
vehicle is distinguished by such elements as armor thick-, 
ness (rear and flanks as well as front), fire power, speed, 
acceleration and gun traverse. Even minor points likq 
fuel tank location can be critical. 



Here are just some of the exciting features: 

S T.A.C. can be played solitaire against the computer or as 
player (or two team) game with the computer as 



a two 
mediator. 

n The most important armored vehicles of Britain, Russia, U.S. 
and Germany are available to command— 40 in all. 

■ Choose from five different scenarios to play. Actions range 
from open meeting engagements to assaults against 
prepared positions. 

■ You pick the sides. You choose the weapons. A simple pur- 
chasing system has been provided to let you "buy" what you 
want in balance with your opponent. 

■ The results of combat are determined by the computer. It 
factors such critical elements as range, armor thickness (front, 
rear and flanks), tracking time, the speed and maneuvers of 
both the firing and target units, visibility and weapon adjust- 
ment to determine weapon accuracy. 

■ Special options include hidden movement, improved 
positions, smoke mortars, minefields, close assaults, overruns 
and indirect fire. 

T.A.C. on diskette retails for 340.00 and can be played 
on the followjing computers: Apple® H's 48K (Mock-

CONTEST 
WINNERS 



An International Incident: May's Contest Winner 



Okay, we made a few mistakes. First of all, 
we left off the entry deadline for the contest. As 
one entrant caustically pointed out, this was sim- 
ple stupidity. The deadline for Softalk contests 
is usually the fifteenth of the month following 
publication; we somewhat arbitrarily made the 
deadline the fifteenth of June, and so far no one 
has submitted an answer after that date, so 
we're safe. If you submitted an answer, you're 
in. If you didn't, you're too late. 

However, we're only owning up to genuine 
mistakes. Michael Frediani (Tracy, CA) points 
out that in our illustration we have sixteen 
places but only fourteen wine glasses. Since 
whether or not any of the guests drink was not a 
clue and had no effect on the outcome, this was 
simply nitpicking. If you can't do the contest 
there must be errors — is that it? 

As much as we'd like to, we don't know 
each of you f)ersonally, so we don't know wheth- 
er you're male or female. Which means that we 
had to make it possible for either a male or a fe- 
male to be the ambassador. And because two 
men cannot sit next to each other, the people sit- 
ting on either side of the ambassador have to 
be— you guessed it— female. And one of the 
premises states that, for security reasons 
(which, for security reasons, we can't go into 
here) you have to sit between the professors 
from Czechoslovakia and Finland; the pro- 
fessors from Czechoslovakia and Finland must 
be women. All those whose solutions listed ei- 
ther of the professors of Czechoslovakia and 
Finland as being men were disqualified, and 
better luck next time. 

But wait: We don't know you, but you know 
you. Well, although we didn't stipulate that you 
had to solve the puzzle keeping in mind that we 
didn't know what the gender of the ambassador 
would be, obviously the contest was open to 
everyone, male or female. The solution is predi- 
cated on the fact that the people on either side of 
the ambassador had to be women. (Incidentally, 
people with masculine first names who wrote in 
and listed themselves as female ambassadors, 
and vice versa, were not immediately dis- 
qualified, but we did have to wonder, Michael, 
John, Sharie and Marilyn.) 



All but four of the entrants, in fact, were dis- 
qualified for overlooking one rule or another. 
The four who advanced to the random number 
agitator were John Jourdan (Stillwater, MN), 
Sharie Fry (Lindenhurst, IL), Marilyn Brown 
(Saint Louis, MO), and the winner, Kathy Rolfe 
of Kansas City, MO, and ambassador to 
Albania. 

The Spouse of Life. A lot of ambassadors 
wrote in to tell us that we can't count; they're 
the ones who had trouble with the word spouse. 
Consider this: If you are married, and you and 
your spouse go to a party together, and you are 
the only married couple there, how many 
spouses are in attendance? One? Don't be so 
egotistical. Two is the correct answer. 

Okay, are we all together so far? Honorable 
mention goes to ambassadors who just missed 
out by a single rule. Like the rule indicating that 
the professor of microcomputing was female, 
which is where E.E. Rehmus (San Francisco, 
CA) and Steve Robertson (Kent, WA), with 
otherwise good solutions, missed their chances 
to proceed to the terrible random number gen- 
erator by making the microcomputing professor 
male. 

We said that the spouse of the professor 
from France is jealous and must sit next to the 
professor. Jerry Dubuke (South Farmingdale, 
NY) managed to circumvent this problem by 
leaving the professor from France unmarried. 
Not the solution we were looking for, but an in- 
teresting approach. Likewise, one of the prem- 
ises was that the spouse of the professor from 
Brazil and the spouse of the professor from Al- 
bania are best friends and prefer to sit across 
from each other; Danita Perkins (Aurora, CO) 
submitted an answer that did not carry out this 
suggestion. While the word prefer can be con- 
strued as a suggestion rather than as a rule, any 
solution that did ftilfill it would be a better re- 
sponse — promote more harmony at the party— 
than one that didn't, so it's as good as a rule; 
thus Danita didn't make it either. Also of Au- 
rora, and also disqualified, was Thomas Turn- 
bull, who simply threw out years of higher edu-

CO, from assembly language to microcom-

The only plausible answer that did not wind 
up in the RNG was that of Karl Middlebrooks 
(Monahans, TX), whose solution is, "Forget 
about a formal dinner. Have a swimming party. 
It won't matter where anyone sits, since they'll 
all be in the pool." Sounds like a lot more fun 
Karl's way. However. . . . 

Below is a diagram of the contest solution as 
we designed it (ha ha), and Kathy's solution. 
Except for a slight seating misarrangement, all 
of Kathy's answers are acceptable. And, be- 
cause there was no written clue to contradict her 
solution, she wins. 

There was an unwritten clue to support our 
solution rather than Kathy's. At the top of the 



AUGUST 1984 



picture of the table are two chairs with flags 
drawn on the seats — one is the flag of Brazil, the 
other the flag of Albania. These are not the seats 
of the professors from these countries, but of 
their spouses, who are best friends. Kathy put 
the spouse of the professor from Brazil and the 
spouse of the professor from Albania across 
from one another, but not in those seats. How- 
ever, since it was not written it was not really a 
rule, just a clue, and we can't hold her to it. 

Oh yes, she also included a language other 
than the one we assigned to them, Portuguese 
rather than English, but there is no rule disal- 
lowing that, either. So Kathy, congratulations. 
With a very fine job on a tough contest, you 
have, indeed, served your country, and your 
guests, well. Bon appetit. 31

Its time to get 



The reviews are in and 
everyone agrees. There's 
never been a personal 
computer that's easier or 
more fun to use than the 
Macintosh™ Especially with 
terrific programs like 
Mac Write™ and MacPaint™ 
to get you started. 

But if you really want to 
take full advantage of your 
Mac's tremendous abilities, 
you'll need to go a step 
further than just writing 
letters and painting pic- 
tures. You'll need some 
serious business tools to 
make you more productive. 

And the first one to 
purchase is Habadex. 

Desktop management 
has arrived. 

Habadex is pioneering 
an entirely new category 



in computer software—

the only program that lets 
you do on your Mac what 
you now do on your desk. 
So you can put your ad- 
dress and phone directory 
appointment calendar, 
things-to-do list— and 
any other paperwork that 
clutters your desk and your 
mind— right into your Mac. 

And because Habadex 
was designed specifically 
for the Macintosh, it incor- 
porates all of the same 
graphic capabilities that 
have made Apple's new 
computer so incredible. 
And incomparable. 

A data base based on 
your own needs. 

Habadex lets you create 
and sort hundreds of 



records. You can arrange 
the large number of fields 
however you choose. By 
first name, last name, com- 
pany category zip code, 
etc. You can even rename 
fields, and rearrange or 
change information easily 
for complete flexibility 

You've found your calling. 

Habadex lets you create 
and arrange an entire 
phone directory within 
your data base. It dials 
direct and long-distance 
calls, automatically insert- 
ing your O.C.C. like Sprint 
or MCI. It has a quick- 
dial feature for storing 
commonly-called personal 
or emergency numbers. 
And it works with the in- 
expensive HabaDialer or 
your current modem.

Peeling "Apples in Tunisia" 

Tremendous care needs to be taken in Softalk's 
editorial policy, lest the magazine suffer a serious 
and possibly fatal degeneration— from an informa- 
tive journal to just another medium that one must 
sort through to separate the truth from implicit po- 
litical propaganda. 

Andrew Christie's article in the May issue was 
informative in that it showed how the relatively 
new technologies of the Apple II and related soft- 
ware can aid decision-making processes in less de- 
veloped nations (specifically, Tunisia). My prob- 
lem is with certain hidden, spurious assumptions 
put forth in the article pertaining to Western culpa- 
bility for Third World poverty. 

Critics of capitalism often point to the tremen- 
dous wealth enjoyed by capitalist nations as an ex- 
planation, a cause, for Third World poverty: We 
are rich because they are poor. There are objec- 
tions to this philosophy. Capitalism, both as a phi- 
losophy and as a system (a highly successful one at 
that), is only about two hundred years old. Poverty 
and starvation, as human conditions, go back 
much further. It seems strange to argue that the 
cause of a problem is much younger than the prob- 
lem itself. And there is absolutely not a shred of 
empirical evidence causally linking the two condi- 
tions—Western wealth and Third World poverty. 
To the contrary, there is much evidence that the 
West provides massive infusions of capital and ex- 
pertise to Third World nations to no avail. There is 
much hostility to capitalism in the Third World, 
and much predilection toward having planned econ- 
omies. They are paying heavily for that hostility 
and those predilections in terms of the wealth they 
fail to generate. 

It is with these arguments in mind that I note, 
unhappily, that Christie, perhaps unwittingly, 
pays quite a bit of homage to the spurious assump- 
tion I have described. He writes: "The African 
problem of chronic hunger is deeply rooted, going 
back to the policies of the nineteenth-century colo- 
nial governments and their emphasis on industry 
and urban development at the expense of agricul- 
ture and basic food production." My suggestion is 
that the problem's roots originate further back 
than a mere century ago. Surely Christie is not 
arguing that Tunisians had plenty to eat for cen- 
turies and then, all of a sudden, the wicked West- 
ern imperialists came and mucked everything up 
for them. 

Is Christie saying that, as a rule, developing 
countries that attempt to develop industry rather 
than agriculture are in danger of starving them- 
selves? Well, obviously, somebody has to grow 
the food we eat. However, Japan, Hong Kong, and 
Singapore have no significant potential for agricul- 
tural development. Yet they enjoy quickly devel- 
oping economies, rapidly rising standards of hving, 
and— the point of this illustration— they generate 
enough surplus revenue to buy food from coun- 
tries that have the resources to produce it. Christie 
should not argue that Tunisia's hunger problem is 



Discussion 



due to an overemphasis on industrial development, 
but rather that its industrial development has been 
unsuccessful. 

Poverty is the natural condition of man. We 
need no theories to explain the existence of it. 
Wealth such as we enjoy in this country would 
have seemed incredible only a century ago. Those 
who are concerned with helping the Third World 
break out of its poverty should first attempt to un- 
derstand how it is that our wealth was created in 
the first place. A real effort needs to be made to 
put forth a theory of wealth to those Third World 
leaders who would really like to do something for 
their people. Words like "progress" and "devel- 
opment" must have tangible, real-world mean- 
ings. "Development" is not merely that which 
takes place during the time between point A and 
point B. The word becomes meaningless when 
used as Christie uses it, when he refers to Tunisia 
as a "developing nation," and yet cites the fact 
that its food production is actually decreasing. 
Not intending to insult Tunisia, wouldn't a better 
description of the country's economy be 
"undeveloping"? 

The tendency to oversimplify problems per- 
taining to the wealth of nations, or lack thereof, 
must be struggled with. Western economic success 
has involved whole ranges of political, moral, so- 
ciological, and economic factors. Among these fac- 
tors is the premise that a free economy will outper- 
form a centrally controlled, directorate economy 
every time.

Around tlie World in Twenty Pages 

As an avid reader of Softalk I looked forward to 
reading the May issue, only to see twenty editorial 
pages wasted on "Apples All Over the World." 
Frankly, who cares? I am a new Apple user and 
try to understand all the articles written. But arti- 
cles on how Apples or any other computers are 
used in other countries will not help me use my 
Apple. Those twenty-six pages could have been 
devoted to more features for beginners like my- 
self. I wonder how many readers did as I did and 
skipped over most of those pages? In the future 
please stay to the subject of computing and forget 
the travel section. 

John De Benedictis, Croton-on-Hudson, NY 

McWilliams Does the Books 

In his article "McWilliams: He Costs Too Much" 
(April Softalk), Matt Yuen is guilty, I fear, of pre- 
cisely what he accuses me of doing: ignoring facts 
in favor of feeling. Yuen's feeling about me is one 
of pure hatred (God knows why), and he doesn't 
let a single fact get in the way of expressing his ut- 
ter contempt for me. It was a written extension of 
the artwork that accompanied the piece: my face 
with a moustache painted on. 

To refute any of it would be as silly as getting 
out my bottle of CorrecType and painting over the 
painted-on moustache. If Yuen wishes to paint me 
as a villain with a moustache, so be it. I certainly 
don't want to answer him tit for tat. Considering 
the amount of tat he flung at me, I'm just not prop- 
erly equipped to respond. 

I would like to say, however, that I am not anti- 
Apple computer, or anti- Apple user— merely pro- 
consumer. In my desire that computer buyers get 
the most for their money, I have taken swipes at 
just about every manufacturer, and have upset the 
users of just about every computer. (If you think 



certain Apple users are not pleased with me, you 
should hear what Adam Osborne has to say. Talk 
about tat!) 

I have always thought of myself as being on the 
side of Apple users and, especially, potential Ap- 
ple users. Apples do so much. For a long time they 
had a near-monopoly on applications for education 
and for the disabled. I was frustrated when people 
had to spend several thousand dollars for a collec- 
tion of hardware that was being sold elsewhere for 
roughly half as much. (Compare, say, the cost of 
a Kaypro II to a comparably equipped Apple II 
about a year ago.) 

At $1,395 for just the basic unit— no drives, 
monitor, software, or anything else— the Apple lie 
was overpriced. Now that it is more reasonably 
priced, the reviews in the revised editions of my 
books will reflect this. The free update we send 
out to readers of the books has this to say about the 
current price reduction (it also has appeared in my 
syndicated column): 

Apple dropped the list price on the He. A two-drive 
system with a monitor, an 80-column card, upper 
and lowercase characters lists for $1,744 and gen- 
erally sells for less. At last: a reasonable price. 
For a basic computer that has been around forever 
and has terrific support, the Apple lie may be the 
one to consider, especially for home and educa- 
tional use. 

For years I fought for a less expensive Apple 
II, long before the He. Ironically, the rumor has 
gotten around that I'm down on Apple computers

and down on Apple users. I'm not. I am down on 
Apple Computer for charging so much for so long. 
If they had lowered the price of the II a couple of 
years ago, do you think the Commodore 64 would 
have made the inroads it has made in the home and 
educational markets? And, with an Apple II land- 
slide going on, perhaps IBM would not have got- 
ten the foothold they now hold in the industry. 

Although I'm sure I had nothing whatsoever to 
do with the new lower price, I think it's a healthy 
move for Apple, the computer industry, and— 
most important— Apple users everywhere. Even

Michael Ferris's article, "Born to Compute: Ap- 
ples Monitor Prenatal Babes" (April 1984) sug- 
gests that diagnosis is an art that computer science 
will not replace. While computers clearly have not 
replaced doctors as yet, computers are making sig- 
nificant inroads as consultants in certain aspects of 
diagnostic medicine, as well as many other areas 
previously left to human expertise. 

Knowledge engineering is the process of ex- 
tracting the required information from a human 
expert and then transforming it into a form usable 
by a computer system. The basic goal of these en- 
deavors has been to develop computer systems hav- 
ing a degree of expertise that could, in certain spe- 
cialized problem areas, rival that of human ex- 
perts. A typical expert system would consist of 
many of the following subsystems: a component 
for making inferences, a component that contains 




^nt TAi 1/ 



the expert's facts, opinions, and heuristics, a com- 
ponent to manage the information, a component 
for acquiring new information, another for pro- 
viding an explanation of the system's reasoning, 
and another that acts as the intelligent consultant 
by interacting with the user. In order to carry out 
certain of these functions, expert systems tend to 
use languages that are more adept at handling the 
expression of relationships rather than numerical 
quantities, such as Lisp and a newer language 
called Prolog. 

These expert systems are not merely informa- 
tion retrieval devices— they actually make infer- 
ences and draw conclusions— nor are they just ex- 
perimental tools or obscure scientific instruments. 
Expert systems are being used in many applied situ- 
ations where their conclusions influence human 
decision making. Well-established expert systems 
have an accuracy rate that rivals and, in certain 
cases, surpasses that of human experts. They have 
even been able to solve some problems that have 
apparently stymied human experts. In medicine, 
for instance, a number of programs have been con- 
structed to act as consultants in the diagnosis and 
treatment of a variety of medical problems. Expert 
systems are also operating in areas involving struc- 
tural analysis, genetic cloning, symbolic analysis 
in mathematics, construction of computer configu- 
rations, identification of molecular structures, 
laboratory synthesis of substances, and evaluation 
of geological information for ore deposits— and 
the list goes on. With the knowledge gained from 
working on expert systems in specific areas, re- 
searchers have been able to construct general-pur- 
pose programs that make the development of new 
expert systems easier and faster. Thus, we will 
probably see more and more of these systems in 



AUGUST 1984 



the near future. 

Although expert systems can be quite impres- 
sive, they clearly have their limitations. In a sense 
these systems have sacrificed breadth of knowl- 
edge for depth of knowledge and thus, while they 
are expert in one narrow area, they lack the broad 
range of knowledge needed to show the type of 
general intelligence displayed by humans in their 
everyday lives. In spite of this important limita- 
tion, though, the successes achieved by expert 
systems should lead us to be very cautious about 
suggesting that computers cannot and will not ever 
be able to perform certain types of tasks. We have 
too many instances already in which such impres- 
sions have been wrong.

Progressive Headache 

I own an Apple II Plus and I am becoming con- 
cerned about the continued viability of my system. 
I do not particularly need the speed and enhance- 
ments that some of the newer computers offer. Nev- 
ertheless, I wonder if I am going to be forced to 
make new hardware purchases in the near future. 

When the Apple He was introduced, most soft- 
ware houses began offering their products for both 
the II Plus and the He. Recently, however, it ap- 
pears that more and more new software is being 
offered for the He only. Noticeable among these 
are the new PFS products, VisiCalc Advanced Ver- 
sion, and others. Are these situations simply iso- 
lated instances of companies taking advantage of 
the particular capabilities of the He, or do they 
represent an abandonment of the EI Plus? 

A related problem is that of competing operat- 
ing systems. Will the movement toward MS-DOS 
and sixteen- or thirty-two-bit computers cause soft- 
ware authors to abandon DOS 3.3? Apple Com- 
puter itself has not helped matters with its use of 
different operating systems on every product, mak- 
ing them generally incompatible with one another. 
Will purchasing ProDOS enhance our chances of 
being able to run future software? Are there prod- 
ucts available that will permit us II Plus owners to 
run He and IBM software? Assuming that I am will- 
ing and able to purchase new hardware and essen- 
tially abandon my investment in my II Plus, the 
software problem remains. Will there be ways for 
us to use software designed for other machines 
without sacrificing our investments in perfectly 
good, albeit older, computers?

Board Bumping Borders on Lunacy 

My problems started when I decided to upgrade my 
Apple II Plus system to a He system. My II Plus 
was already bursting at the seams with nine periph- 
eral cards installed (a Legend Industries slot 8 
board held two cards). A special interest to me in 
purchasing the He was the availability of the Micro- 
soft Premium Softcard He package. This three-in- 
one board (64K RAM, eighty-column capability, 
and CP/M) would eliminate my Videx board and 
Z-80 card, in effect ft^eeing up one slot in the He 
(maybe for an AppleMouse n card?). (Y ou're prob- 
ably wondering at this point why I need nine cards 
in the first place. Well, my alphaSyntauri synthe- 
sizer system utilizes three boards, and these cou- 
pled with the add-ons happen to equal nine.) 

I purchased the He and the Microsoft Premium 
card and this started a crazy chain of events. Only a 
few days prior to buying my He, I bought a Rana 
Systems Elite 3 drive (160-track, 652K double- 
sided storage) and was using it on the n Plus under 
CP/M 2.3. Rana provides a patching utility for

CP/M 2.2 and 2.3 only. You can imagine my hor- 
ror when I booted the Microsoft systems disk from 
the Premium Softcard package and saw the sign-on 
message: CP/M 2.26! A call to Rana Systems con- 
firmed my worst fears: Rana did not support CP/M 
2.26 and had no plans to support it in the future. A 
frantic call to Microsoft was fruitless; they were 
sympathetic but unable to change Rana's lack of 
drivers. So, out came the Premium card and back in 
went the Videx and Z-80 cards, for who wants to 
give up 652K of storage for whatever enhancements 
CP/M 2.26 offers? 

There's more. The extra free slot was now in- 
deed filled by the AppleMouse n board. Everything 
was working fine until I later tried to boot a CP/M 
disk and the system just hung. By pulling out all of 
my cards and reinserting them one by one, I identi- 
fied the problem as the AppleMouse board. The in- 
terrupts it generates cause the CP/M system to 
hang. And so out came the mouse board. Granted, I 
had no intention of using the mouse under CP/M. 
Still, who wants to insert and reinsert cards for each 
particular computer use? 

And still more. With the purchase of the Rana 
Elite 3 drive, I also bought the Rana controller 
card, which features four-drive capability— another 
nice slot saver. Having reached the point where I 
was nearly convinced that I was the butt of some 
cosmic Polish joke, I booted the Syntauri system 
with some trepidation, and I was duly rewarded: 
the oscillators sounded like canned laughter. Again, 
I started pulling cards out of the computer— at this 
juncture I had already hired an assistant to aid in the 
uplifting task of board yanking— and soon found the 
reason for this latest problem. Apparently, the Rana 
disk controller interfered with the two Mountain 
Computer music boards. Replacing the Rana con- 



troller with the standard Disk II controller card 
solved the problem. 

I'm left with a Rana drive that is incompatible 
with the Microsoft Premium card, a Rana controller 
card that is incompatible with Mountain Computer 
hardware, and an AppleMouse card that hangs up 
CP/M. The amazing versatility with which periph- 
eral manufacturers have endowed the Apple is 
nothing short of incredible. But in some instances 
the frustration of discovering such incompatibili- 
ties is nothing short of overwhelming. I mean, I'm 
not trying to install a toaster in slot 2! I just want to 
put the top on my Apple and keep it on. 
Robert Hakalski, Philadelphia, PA 

All Anteed Up 

I'd like to pass on a word of caution to anyone con- 
templating the purchase of the new Era 2 modem 
by Microcom. It is, along with its included pro- 
gram, a versatile piece of equipment. Unfortunate- 
ly, what is not made clear, either in the advertise- 
ments or on the outside of its box, is the fact that 
many of its enhancements are not accessible on the 
Apple II Plus. 

The product is advertised to run in the emula- 
tion modes of the DEC VTIOO, DEC VT52, and 
IBM 3101. It is not until one is well into the man- 
ual that the following notation is printed in a box: 
"Note: The terminal emulation modes require an 
Apple lie, Apple 80-column card, and an 80-col- 
umn display. The emulation features cannot be se- 
lected if Era 2 is configured for a 40-column 
display." 

If any of you folks are thinking that you do 
have an eighty-column card, such as the Videx 
Videoterm, forget it. The modem doesn't support 
any but the Apple card on the He. With a II Plus 



AUGUST 1984 



and Videx you are locked into capital letters and 
forty columns. 

Upon calling Microcom I was informed that in 
designing the modem it was decided only to sup- 
port the equipment mentioned, but that possibly at 
some future date changes would be made to the 
software to support other configurations. I certain- 
ly hope so because in all other respects this is a 
powerful hardware and software combination. I 
am most pleased with its operation in all other re- 
spects, but I do wish that its limitations had been 
made clear before I had to ante up to see the hole 
card.

"If I Had a Hammer. ..." 

An announcement for the Graphics Tool Kit by 
Demco Electronics appeared in the May Mar- 
ketalk News. The notice may have left readers 
with some questions. The product is more than just 
another graphics board and program. 

The Graphics Tool Kit is unique because of its 
screen resolution of 640 dots by 768 dots, corre- 
sponding to most dot-matrix printers printing on 8 
1/2-inch by 11 -inch paper. The program is com- 
pletely menu-driven, so I do not have to spend 
time programming and can spend my time on de- 
sign. Of course, if one wishes to use other pro- 
grams, the Graphics Tool Kit is fully compatible 
with Applesoft hi-res commands. My daughter is 
using the kit to make original needlepoint designs 
and to create advertising fliers. My grandchildren 
use it for school report title pages and for letters to 
their friends.

Unsensible 

I was introduced to Dollars and Sense through an 
acquaintance. Though this acquaintance stated that 
the program was good, he indicated that it had 
taken him three months to conquer the documenta- 
tion. I went out and got the program and was eager 
to learn how to put it to good use. That was at least 
six weeks ago. I have tried a dozen times to sit 
down and learn to use the program. I have pro- 
gressed magnificently— I have reached page A-2 1 . 
Not bad for a college graduate. After trying once 
again to sit down quietly and not become frus- 
trated I was prompted to write this letter. I have to 
say that the Dollars and Sense manual is ab- 
solutely the worst piece of documentation I have 
ever seen. I've removed it from my software li- 
brary and secluded it in a metal file drawer, for 
fear that it might contaminate the others.

Schoonmaker's Pirouettes 

In the June Open Discussion I outlined the prob- 
lems I've been having executing printer com- 
mands on my Gemini 10 from Apple Writer He. 
Two days after I received that issue of Softalk, I 
got a call from Jim Pirisino of MinuteWare. Piri- 
sino had read my letter and claimed to have the so- 
lution to my problems. In fact, he was so sure that 
his Glossary Disk for Apple Writer II and He 
would effect a cure that he offered to send me the 
package free of charge. If it worked, I was to send 
him the retail price of $14.95. 

I mailed the check this afternoon. Glossary 
Disk works! In the manual that accompanies the 
disk, Pirisino offers a simple set of steps to modify 
Apple Writer so that it can generate the null code. 
In five minutes I was able to call up superscript- 
something I've been unable to do for the last 
twelve months. 

I also got a copy of MinuteWare's Minute Man-

ual for Apple Writer He. If I'd had a copy of this 
book in the first place, I'm convinced that my learn- 
ing period with Apple Writer would have been 
reduced from a week to about a day. Minute Man- 
ual is better organized and much easier to follow 
than the manual Apple provides with Apple Writer 
(which wasn't all that bad), and it contains proce- 
dures that either aren't in the official manual or are 
too deeply buried for me to unearth. 

Anyone who's having printer command prob- 
lems with Apple Writer and Gemini, Epson FX or 
MX, Okidata 92, Apple Dot Matrix, ProWriter, 
or NEC 8023A printers ought to look into Minute- 
Ware. Jim Pirisino has earned the business. 
David Schoonmaker, Arden, NC 

David Schoonmaker's angry letter of warning 
(June Open Discussion) sounds familiar to those of 
us who chose to mix-and-match non-Apple print- 
ers and interface cards. I also bought a Gemini 
printer and was assured by the vendor that the Mi- 
crotek interface would perform as well if not bet- 
ter than the Apple Parallel Card. My motives for 
going non- Apple were mostly financial: Why pay 
$3(X) more for a printer that provides fewer print 
styles and less graphics flexibility (this according 
to the vendor)? 

I am happy with my Gemini printer, however, 
despite the apparent impossibility of printing sub- 
scripts and superscripts and the necessity of turn- 
ing off the printer every time I want to escape the 
enlarged print mode. You must endure these 
things when you try to save a few bucks. To their 
credit, the Star Micronics people have been very 
friendly and informative when I have had occasion 
to call them with some of my ridiculous questions. I 
believe their lOX is a fine machine for the money. 




If we can share the blame for our troubles with 
anyone, it is with the vendors, many of whom 
seem more interested in demonstrating their ex- 
pertise on the store machines than in selling you 
the right hardware and who are surprisingly igno- 
rant of the practical problems that arise. For exam- 
ple, I received four different, certain answers from 
local vendors to this question: How can I keep my 
second disk drive running more than eight seconds 
so that I can use a cleaning disk? None of the an- 
swers worked, and none of the vendors believed 
me when I told them their solutions didn't solve 
the problem. I finally called Apple Technical Sup- 
port and was told that my own solution— turn off 
the computer, switch the cables on the drive card, 
cold start the second drive as if it were the first- 
was the only way it could be done. Is it too much to 
ask that vendors know about the products they sell? 

Finally, a note to those with non- Apple printer 
interface cards: If you print anything with Apple- 
Works, you'll get some odd margin code (even if 
you use an Apple DMP). Be sure your vendor 
gives or lends you an AppleWorks Non-Apple In- 
terface Configuration disk (free) to modify your 
program disk. Live and learn, eh?

Dynamic Duo 

This is in reply to Jack Woychowski's letter in the 
May issue of Softalk. The people in my depart- 
ment have been using Sensible Speller with Super- 
Text for the last year without any problems. The 
newest version of Sensible Speller works very 
nicely with the files created by Super-Text , allow- 
ing you to go right to the word marked as mis- 
spelled and edit it as necessary. 

For those who don't know, you can go from 



AUGUST 1984 



Super-Text thirteen-sector to DOS 3.3 by using 
Muffin (or a similar program) on an unlocked ini- 
tialized data disk. Note that you can create text 
files instead of binary files with Super-Text by typ- 
ing an asterisk before saving the file. 

I have a question of my own for Super-Text 
users. Does anyone know how to put a DOS 3.3 
text or binary file onto a Super-Text thirteen-sector 
disk? This would enable one to use Super-Text to 
edit a file created by some other program.

CADtalk 

Kenneth Wood was searching the three dimen- 
sions in the June Open Discussion for a good com- 
puter-aided design (CAD) program. At the Uni- 
versity of Redlands we have been using the Cad- 
apple system by T & W Systems, available from 
Thomas Payton & Associates (Flintridge, CA). 
The system we have been using is two-dimension- 
al, but a three-dimensional version is available. To 
date we have been very satisfied with this system 
as a means of instructing freshman engineers in 
computer-aided design. A good source of informa- 
tion on CAD systems is the journal Computers in 
Mechanical Engineering, published by the 
American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

Jersey Aid 

The New Jersey Library for the Blind and Handi- 
capped has recently received funding from two 
corporations to develop a "Talking Apple" proj- 
ect that will first explore and then demonstrate in 
schools and libraries throughout the state the use- 
fulness of computers with blind children. In this 
project we will be working with an Apple lie and 
an Echo II voice synthesizer. Right now we are 
looking for help in identifying software— commer- 
cial or public domain, educational or recreation- 
al—that is compatible with the above hardware 
and could be used by a totally blind child or teen. 
We will be expanding the scope of the project to 
include software usable by both adults and people 
with limited sight, but for now we have elected to 
bite the bullet and to begin with the most difficult 
group to help, totally blind children and young 
adults. Any help readers can provide in idenfifying 
usable software will be appreciated. 
Marya Hunsicker, Director, New Jersey Library 
for the Blind and Handicapped, Trenton, NJ 

This letter was prompted by the letter by David A. 
Mathewes in the March Open Discussion. I hope 
this information is helpful to him and others going 
through the same frustrations of finding informa- 
tion for handicapped computer users. 

I have been helping a friend, who is severely 
handicapped due to cerebral palsy, to set up a com- 
puter system for about three years now. After 
much frustration and letter-writing, I have com- 
piled a small list of sources for those who are also 
trying to help the handicapped. I have found only 
one company that distributes a number of aids for 
the handicapped. TASH (Technical Aids and 
Systems for the Handicapped), located in Mark- 
ham, Ontario, has a nice thirty-seven-page catalog 
with many physical and computer peripheral aids. 
They also have many switches and switch stands 
that are designed for use by the handicapped. 

Trace Research and Development Center for 
the Severely Communicatively Handicapped 
(Trace Research Center, University of Wisconsin 
at Madison) has been very helpful with informa- 
tion. They have an excellent reprint service on 
many papers and articles on handicapped aids.

Applet new ProDOS 
is pro Thunderclock 



When Apple designed their new 
ProDOS operating system for the Apple II 
family, they included an important new 
function — the ability to automatically 
read a clock/calendar card. Nice touch. 

It means that every time you create 
a new file or modify an existing one, the 
time and date are automatically recorded 
and stored in the CATALOG. 

Now you

1 ProDos 




can instantly 
know the 
exact time 
your files were 
last updated. 

Apple could 
have chosen any 
clock for ProDOS 
to recognize, 
but they chose 
only one. 
Thunderclock. 
It's the only 
clock men- 
tioned in 
the ProDOS 
manuals. 

That's a nice 
stroke for us, but it's 
even better for you. 
Because, in addition 
to organizing your disk 
files, Thunderclock will 
add a new dimension to 
all the new ProDOS-based 
software. For instance, with 
business or communications

software you can access a data base or 
send electronic mail automatically, when 
the rates are lowest. Even when you're not 
around. And that's just a start. The better 
you can use your Apple, the better you 
can use a Thunderclock. 

Thunderclock gives you access to 
the year, month, date, day-of-week, 
hour, minute and second. It lets you time 
intervals down to milliseconds and is 
compatible with 
all of Apple's 
languages. 




Thunderclock 
comes with a one-year 
warranty, is powered by 
on-board batteries and runs 
accurately for up to four 
years before simple battery 
replacement. 

If you want to make ProDOS 
really produce, take a page from the 
manual — get yourself a Thunderclock - 
the official ProDOS clock.

Many of these are geared toward the Apple II. 
Please contact Christine Thompson, special proj- 
ects coordinator and assistant to the director. 

Paul Schwejda and Judy McDonald of Adap- 
tive Peripherals (Seattle, WA) have also been 
generous with their help. They manufacture a 
board for the Apple II called the Adaptive Firm- 
ware Card. The Adaptive Firmware Card allows 
the use of virtually all off-the-shelf software and 
provides for controlling the Apple with a single 
switch closure. There are many operating modes 
available with this card, including a separate key- 
board input that allows a pressure-sensitive or any 
special keyboard to be used. It is a well-designed 
card, and I have designed my friend's system 
around it. The documentation is superb. It is writ- 
ten for the user and not for a technician. 

The International Council for Computers in 
Education at the University of Oregon (Eugene, 
OR) publishes Computer Technology for the 
Handicapped in Special Education and Rehabilita- 
tion: A Resource Guide. It has 191 abstracts of ar- 
ticles and papers covering more than seventy sub- 
ject headings and forty-nine publications (in- 
cluding Softalk). 

I hope that this information is as helpful to 
others as it has been for me.

Mac the Greek? 

I want to be able to insert Greek words into Eng- 
lish text. Do any readers know how can I do this? 
Does anyone have a product that will allow this on 
a Ue? Can modifications produce this? Someone 
has reported that I could develop my own Greek 
alphabet with the Macintosh. Is this true?

Two Drives for Brother Nelson 

This is in answer to Wayne Nelson's question in 
the June Open Discussion. First, your controller 
card should be in slot 6. To load a program with 
the first drive you just have to type load (rmme of 
the program). If you want to load a different pro- 
gram from the second drive you would type load 
(name), D2. The D2 specifies drive 2. If you want 
to change the disk drive back to drive 1 just type 
load (name), Dl. I hope this solves your problem. 
Michael Lee, Whitestone, NY 

To Wayne Nelson (June Open Discussion): You 
can't boot from any but drive 1 . Further, the Moni- 
tor ROM checks slots starting from 7 and moving 
to 0, looking for a disk interface card. The first one 
that it finds becomes the boot device. Therefore, 
one will tend to boot from slot 6, drive 1. This is 
very hard, if not impossible, to defeat. 

To J. Schenkman (also in June): Huffin and Puf- 
fin may be found in the Call -A.P.P.L.E. publica- 
tion All About Pascal, available from Call 
-A.P.P.L.E. These programs only transfer text files 
between DOS 3.2 and Apple Pascal format. They 
do not convert software ft'om Applesoft to Pascal or 
vice versa. Although such a conversion is hypo- 
thetically possible, one is better off fiilly rewriting 
the program.

On the Defensive 

I have been a salesperson in a retail electronics 
store for more than four years, during which time 
the personal computer industry has changed ft^om 
an esoteric, expensive, hobbyist type of market to 
one in which it seems everyone is interested. The 
store in which I work does not deal strictly with 
computers, but also handles stereos, telephones, 



video recorders, and related items. However, in 
the past two years the bulk of our sales have come 
from Apple computers. As a result, I consider my- 
self to be a computer salesman working in a com- 
puter store. 

There are stores that are genuinely interested in 
making sure that a customer (or potential custom- 
er) gets the information he needs to make an intel- 
ligent choice of hardware or software. I freely ad- 
mit that we do not stock hundreds of software 
titles, or dozens of peripheral devices that fit every 
possible need. A basic premise of business is that 
you must trim your inventory in order to keep an 
acceptable cash flow. Most retail stores simply 
cannot afford to cater to the hobbyist market for 
this reason alone. The market has moved from the 
hobbyist to the user. It sounds pretty gloomy for 
the hacker, but we do have sources for information 
on things we don't stock, and most suppliers are 
willing to send literature and pricing information 
to us. 

And it's not surprising that buyers are more 
knowledgeable than most salespeople— they prob- 
ably have more time to learn about Apple hard- 
ware and software than a typical salesperson. We 
tend to work forty to fifty hours a week, typically 
spread out over six days. When you work with 
something as a means of making a living you tend 
to lose enthusiasm for it in your off hours. As an 
example, I've been trying to find the time to learn 
Pascal on my Apple for the last six months. I've 
managed to learn how to load it, write a simple 
program, and format a disk. But the little spare 
time I have is so fragmented that learning new 
things about my computer is tough. It is simply 
impossible to keep up with every development in 
hardware and software. There isn't enough time in 
the day! 

I would like to make one more point. One of 
the phrases least likely to endear a customer to a 
retail salesperson is, "I can get that for a third less 
at ABC Mailorder Discount." It is simply poor 
manners to pump a seller for whatever he or she 
knows about a product and then order it through 
the mail. We tend to be pretty cool toward a "cus- 
tomer" like that, since it's about the same thing as 
picking our pockets. Mail order houses can offer 
better prices because they don't have the overhead 
of a showroom, salespeople, repair services, or 
any of the things one would expect to find in a 
store. When dealing with a discount mail order 
firm, if you have problems, you can usually count 
on a long wait for your problem to be solved. On 
the other hand, with a retail store you should ex- 
pect help with questions as well as general support 
long after you buy the product. I agree that this 
isn't the case with a lot of stores. But there are 
good ones out there, and a good one is worth 
patronizing. 

Phil Jurgenson, Mankato, MN 

A Spruce by Any Other Name 

As I was giving my May issue of Softalk a quick 
overview the other day, my attention was grabbed 
by the caption on the photo at the top of page 125. 
Being a long-time resident of Michigan's beautiful 
upper peninsula, not very far from Canada where 
the photo was taken, I thought how very strange it 
was that the Canadian birch trees looked so much 
different from their neighbors here in my woods! 
Perhaps the editors are more used to looking at ap- 
ple orchards than birch groves. In any case, if 
those trees were outside my window, I'd swear 
that they were spruce, not birch. A minor error in 
a fine magazine.

Software 



Now for Something Completely Unoriginal: 
A Plea for Originality in Software 

Licensing is the rage among software publishers today— but who cares about Mickey Mouse if the program is, too? 



Beware software publishers bearing 
"name" gifts. 

The business of publishing software pro- 
grams for microcomputers is beginning to re- 
semble, in an unhealthy way, the business of 
making films. Over the past two years, the in- 
novative, inspired founders of the software in- 
dustry have been collectively battered by a num- 
ber of trends that threaten to narrow the field 
down to a few dozen players. These micro- 
trends include competitive pricing, blitz mar- 
keting, cutthroat talent acquisition techniques, 
buy-outs, buy-ins, and good old fashioned in- 
timidation. 

As software publishing has become a big 
business, some of the truly creative people in 
the industry have fallen on hard times. Like 
Buster Keaton, Erich von Stroheim, and Fritz 
Lang, the early software innovators have been 
faced with the choice of trying to please the 
crowd and remain in business or fiarther explore 
the aesthetics of the media and risk going out of 
business. Perhaps the trends are unstoppable. 
Perhaps they are unavoidable. And then again, 
perhaps they are not. 

One thing is known for sure. The quality of 
future software is in jeopardy. By quality, we 
mean to say the overall worth of a product. 

There is much to be said on this subject, but 
the current licensing rage among software pub- 
lishers is one phenomenon, or trend, that seems 
to send a clear signal to the world: Software has 
to be more than good and innovative; it must be 
recognizable by name alone. 

The danger here is the same as it is in the 
film business. A bad movie about one of the 
most popular cartoon characters in history, say. 



Popeye, is still a bad movie and probably won't 
make any money. A bad computer game about 
one of the most popular movies of modern 
times, such as E.T., is still a bad computer 
game. In the latter case, the game was such a 
disappointment that Atari had to bury thousands 
of unsold units of the game (along with many 
other titles) and cover them up with dirt (did 
they really think anyone would bother to steal 
them?). 

So it is with a nervous smile that we note 
that companies like Sierra, Epyx, and Random 
House are producing software around such 
names as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, the 
Wizard of Id, the Muppets, Barbie, GI Joe, Hot 
Wheels, and Charles Schulz's Peanuts charac- 
ters. It is with forced smiles that we note that 
Steven Spielberg is preparing a remake of Peter 
Pan for release in 1986, and that other produc- 
ers are readying such titles as Alice in Wonder- 
land, Santa Claus, The Bride (a remake of The 
Bride of Frankenstein) , A Chorus Line, The 
Clan of the Cave Bear, and Oz. 

The first big question is. Why? 

Ken Williams of Sierra was quoted in a re- 
cent Los Angeles Times article as saying, 
"When a parent goes to a K-Mart to look for 
software, he's not going to recognize our name, 
but he'll know Donald Duck. And he may look 
on the Disney name as a guarantee that this isn't 
some kind of shoddy product." 

Okay. The second big question is. How? 

It would be a journalistic gaffe of the lowest 
order to say that all games or programs created 
around a licensed story, character, or idea will 
be bad. On the contrary, some might even im- 
prove upon the technology. But will we ever see 



an Indiana Jones or Gremlins game that sets the 
consumers and creators abuzz like Choplifter 
did? 

The movie Superman rejuvenated that ven- 
erable American hero bom in comic books for 
at least a few more years, as well as making the 
character palatable to adults who would like to 
forget that they ever read comic books. But the 
reason Superman was such a success, able to 
cross age and maturity levels, is that a wide- 
screen, color, stereo sound film with real actors 
and real dialogue is a dazzling enhancement of 
the Superman comics— which are dressed-up 
good-and-evil morality plays aimed at fourteen- 
year-olds just starting to watch Hill Street Blues 
and to see films like Terms of Endearment. 

Will Donald Duck computer games really 
improve on the original cartoons and comic 
books? Can Apples, or any other brand of mi- 
crocomputer, improve on the medium of cellu- 
loid for graphic entertainment? Will Spinnaker 
Software's programs using characters and situa- 
tions licensed from such writers as Ray Brad- 
bury, Arthur C. Clarke, and Michael Crichton 
be half as satisfying as the real thing? 

When one examines the most successful 
games and programs originally produced for 
computers— Zork, Wizardry, Ultima, Choplift- 
er, Ixide Runner, One-on-One, The Wizard and 
the Princess, Castle Wolfenstein, Olympic De- 
cathlon—the creativity in these products shines 
like the marquees on Hollywood Boulevard and 
Forty-Second Street. And there have been many 
more creative, original products that were not 
so successful commerically— Cro5s/ire, Bolo, 
Ceiling Zero, Rendezvous, Way-Out, and Spy's 
Demise, to name but a few.

It's a shame that software publishers blame a 
product's poor sales on lack of immediate recog- 
nition by consumers. How about blaming the 
marketing and advertising departments? 

Does anyone remember the film Fat Cityl 
Released in 1972 for a week, this John Huston- 
directed film, starring Stacy Keach as a down- 
and-out boxer who makes an attempt to come 
back, is a legendary example of botched 
marketing and advertising. The film never did 
well at the box office because it wasn't given the 
chance. Then and now, 1972 is a year remem- 
bered for films such as The Godfather, Sleuth, 
Cabaret, The Ruling Class, and Sounder— all 
based on works from other media. 

Without a doubt, successful software pub- 
lishing is tough. The current trend of licensing 
names, characters, settings, and stories should 
come as no surprise. After all, Shakespeare 
wrote about Antony, Caesar, Cleopatra, and 
Henry the Fifth; Alexander Dumas wrote about 
Louis the Xm and Cardinal Richelieu. On the 
other hand, Shakespeare wrote The Tempest and 



Dumas wrote The Count of Monte Cristo. Some- 
times the old stories are great. Sometimes the 
new stories are even greater. 

How many Fat Citys is the software industry 
going to send to an early grave before it realizes 



that programs about movies and cartoon charac- 
ters are just as risky? It takes guts and perhaps a 
httie luck, but for my money, creativity and origi- 
nality will always stand out in the end. 

—David Hunter 



Programming 

Journey into the 
Unknown: A 
Happy Ending 

Using ProDOS seems scary to casual computerists 
raised on DOS. But it 's really very logical— and it 
makes other tasks a whole lot easier. 

ProDOS isn't hard. It has, perhaps, an in- 
timidating reputation. It's been called a simpler 
version of SOS, the Apple IE operating system. 
Indeed, it has some of SOS's nice features, and 



also lacks some of them. Apple III enthusiasts 
who examine ProDOS are disappointed to find 
that the Apple n family is still without formally 
defined device drivers. Personally, that's okay 
with me. The Apple II is still a hacker's ma- 
chine, although the hackers have done a dam 
good job of making it safe for the casual user in 
the last few years. 

One feature of ProDOS that often confuses 
but has the potential to enlighten is the concept 
of subdirectories. If volumes, path names, and 
prefixes still get you down, don't let them. You 
can learn some minimal stuff, ignore subdirec- 
tories altogether, and still get by just fine as 
long as you're using floppy disks. The main di- 



rectory of a ProDOS disk behaves enough like 
the DOS catalog that you can learn the differ- 
ences in one sitting and that will be enough. If 
you intend to use a hard disk, that will not be 
enough. Subdirectories are made for mass-stor- 
age devices like hard disks. In fact, if you want 
to keep a lot of files on a floppy disk, you can 
benefit from the same feamres of ProDOS that 
make it a practical hard disk operating system. 

A DOS catalog has space for 105 file names. 
On occasion, you will have so many small fdes 
that you will use up all these spaces and get disk 
full messages even when you have dozens of 
free sectors left. Consider a list of 105 file 
names and how best to display it on a twenty- 
four-line screen. Think about how many times 
you have typed catalog and then accidentally 
scrolled by the name you're looking for. There 
are some application programs that let you 
scroll the listing both ways until you find the file 
you want, but it really isn't practical to do that 
at the lowest level: the DOS command level. 

How does ProDOS solve this problem? By 
allowing you only fifty-one files in the disk's 
main directory. That's a solution? Yes, 
because, unlike DOS, ProDOS allows you to 
make some of those fdes additional directories. 
You can put as many fdes in as many additional 
directories as you have a mind to. To get to the 
fdes in those directories, you have to tell Pro- 
DOS first the directory name and then the file 
name, creating a pathway (you may have to tell 
it the disk name also— we'll get to that). 

Let's start from the beginning with a blank 
disk. Using the Filer or the lie System Utilities, 
you would format the disk and name it some- 
thing suitably general. Name it? Yes. Unlike 
DOS, which impersonally calls disks by slot 
and drive numbers, ProDOS gets familiar; it

calls disks by name. Think of the switch from 
DOS to ProDOS as being like leaving the Army 
and joining a country club. The new customs 
may be difficult to get used to (every time some- 
one yells, "Fore," you have the uncontrollable 
urge to yell, "Hup two"), but you may find 
them to be nicer when you do. 

There are limitations on what you can call 
the disk, but not unreasonable ones. If you're a 
fan of George Carlin, you may be tempted to 
name the disk A place for my stuff, but that 
breaks two of the ProDOS file, directory, and 
volume naming rules. First of all, you can't use 
spaces in a file name (or a directory or volume 
name— they all follow the same rules), and sec- 
ond, you can't make the name longer than fif- 
teen characters. Other rules are pretty much like 
the DOS fde name rules, but the most important 
rule is the rule of thumb: If the computer tells 
you syntax error, it may just be referring to an 
illegal file name. 

So let's call the disk Afy.^fMj^ instead; you'll 
find that brevity pays in the long run. Copy the 
fdes ProDOS and Basic. System onto the disk so 
you'll be able to give the system commands in 
its own language. Then boot the disk. (You 
don't really have to do all these things; this isn't 
a programming class. Sit back in your favorite 
chair and read on. Maybe try the commands out 
later. I won't mind.) 

At this point, with the brand-new ProDOS 
disk booted, things look like they would had 
you just booted a DOS disk. You can type cat, 
and it will catalog the disk in drive 1 . You can 
type cat,d2 and it will catalog a disk in drive 2. 
If you tell it to save a file at this point, it will 
save it on the disk you last catalogued, just like 
DOS would. However, there are ways you can 
introduce ProDOS to a particular disk so that 
the computer will always want that disk, no 
matter what drive it's in, unless you tell it other- 
wise. There's a word for this, and the word is 
prefix. 

Prefix can be a question or a command. If 
you just type prefix, the computer will tell you 
what disk it would like to use for loading and 
saving files if you were to give it the choice. 
Right now, that would be the disk you just cata- 
logued. If you just catalogued My. stuff, the 
computer would respond /My. stuff/. If you just 
catalogued some junk disk in drive 2, the com- 
puter would tell you /Some Junk/. The slashes 
are there because that is how ProDOS separates 
disk names, subdirectory names, and file 
names. Now, if you want to deal mostly with 
My. stuff, and only occasionally have commerce 
with Some .junk, you can use prefix to tell the 
computer. Type either prefix /My. stuff or 
prefix, dl (if My. stuff is still in drive 1). 

Now when you catalog the disk or do any- 
thing else, the computer will assume you mean 
you want to do it to My.smff, unless you speci- 
fy otherwise. ProDOS is more tenacious than 
DOS in this way. It will look for My. stuff in 
any and all disk drives it can find. If it doesn't 
find My. stuff it will sulk. 

If you want ProDOS to read the catalog of 
Some.junk, however, you can tell it so in one of 
three ways. First, type cat/Some. junk. That tells 
it to look in all of the drives until it finds Some.- 
junk. Second, type cat,d2. With that command, 
it will catalog the disk in drive 2 regardless of its 



name, just as DOS would. Using either of these 
methods, the next time you type just cat, you 
will get the catalog of My .stuff again. The third 
way is to change the prefix to Some.junk and 
then enter a simple cat command. 

So far, we've had to deal with only one 
name at a time— the volume or root directory 
name— or with none at all. But what if we want- 
ed to load a program named Records. To load it 
from My. stuff, assuming that My. stuff is the 
prefixed disk, just type load Records, exactly as 
you would with DOS. To get Records off the 
other disk, however, you again have three op- 
tions. Tell it the volume name before the file 
name, tell it the fde name and the drive number, 
or change the prefix and tell it the file name. 
For example: 

LOAD /SOME.JUNK/RECORDS 

LOAD REC0RDS,D2 

PREFIX /SOME.JUNK 
LOAD RECORDS 

Again, only the third of the three possibili- 
ties actually changes the prefix. 

Now, note the difference between loading a 
fde from the prefixed disk and loading one from 
any other disk: 

LOAD RECORDS 

LOAD /SOME.JUNK/RECORDS 

The first command loads the file Records 
from the prefixed disk, which may still be 
My. stuff or may be something else if you've 
tried some of these suggestions. If you're ever 
unsure, remember that you can ask what the pre- 
fix is by typing prefix. The second command 
loads Records from the disk Some.junk. 

Suppose you had occasion to put two kinds 
of fdes into My. stuff: fdes about your personal 
inventory and files about your chief hobby, 
which is tracking interesting items in the Guin- 
ness Book of World Records. In some situations, 
you might be tempted to keep such disparate 
items on separate disks, but if you didn't have 
any blanks on hand, or, more important, if you 
happened to have five or ten megabytes of hard 
disk storage kicking around, you would have 
good reason to put all your data in one volume. 

So, what to do? Well, you could put all the 
fdes in the main directory and get away with it, 
as long as you had fewer than fifty-one files. 
But then you'd have to go through a fairly long 
catalog before you found the relevant fde. Sup- 
pose you could find some way to list only those 
files that are relevant to a particular task? 

In ProDOS, this is done dirough subdirecto- 
ries. You can easdy create two different direc- 
tories on My.smff and then store the Guinness 
files in one and the inventory fdes in the other. 
Make sure the prefix is My^tuff, and type 

CREATE GUINNESS, TDIR 
CREATE INVENTORY, TDIR 

Now when you catalog My. stuff, you find 
two more files on it. Guinness and Inventory, 
each with the file type dir. Each of these is a 
unique directory, and each will essentially be- 
have Idee a separate disk (although with less free

Space). Let's save one file in each of these and 
then play with it. The first file, which will go in 
the Inventory directory, will be a database of 
your phonograph collection, called Records. 
The second file, destined for the Guinness 
directory, will also be called Records. For ob- 
vious reasons. 

Since these will just be dummy files, we'll 
just use empty Basic programs. Type:

SAVE GUINNESS/RECORDS 
SAVE INVENTORY/RECORDS 

We now have two files on the same disk with 
the same name. That's what it means to say that 
two directories behave much like two different 
disks. Now, assume that we're starting from 
scratch, that no prefix has been set, and that 
ProDOS doesn't know My. stuff from Adam. 
You want to work with the Inventory file 
Records. How would you go about it? 

LOAD /MY.STUFF/INVENTORY/RECORDS 

work . . . work . . . work . . . 

SAVE /MY.STUFF/INVENTORY/RECORDS 

and so on. . . . 

Seems like file names are getting out of 
hand, doesn't it? That long string of names is 
what is known as a path name, so called because 
it tells the computer what path to follow to get to 
a particular file. Since you're likely to save a 
given file many times in the course of working 
on it, it's a good thing we have prefixes. Pre- 
fixes can be used, as we've seen, to specify 
which disk to use: 

PREFIX /MY STUFF 

LOAD INVENTORY/RECORDS 

SAVE INVENTORY/RECORDS 



They can also be used to specify which sub- I 
directory on a particular disk to use: 

PREFIX /MY.STUFF/INVENTORY 
LOAD RECORDS 
SAVE RECORDS 

It looks a little more reasonable now. The 
more you load and save the file, the more bene- 
fit you get from having set the prefix. The only 
question you may have remaining (who am I to 
say? You may have hundreds of questions re- 
maining. I, however, will only answer one of 
them) is how do you know when to begin the 
path name with a slash and when not to. You 
may have noticed that in the first load and save 
example, which used full path names, the name 
began with a slash, but it didn't in the other ex- 
amples. Basically, here's why: The slash at the 
start of a path name means, here's a full path 
name, beginning with the volume name. Ignore 
any prefix you may be thinking of and use this 
name here. If you type a name that doesn't 
begin with a slash, that means here 's a partial 
path name. Add the prefix you 've got in memory 
to the beginning of the name in order to get the 
full name of the file I'm looking for. That's a 
mouthful for just a humble slash to say, but it's 
a very important slash. 

ProDOS path names are like personal names 
in some highly traditional patrilineal (or matri- 
lineal) society. A person's formal name might 
be Fred, son of Jacob, son of Mack, son of 
James, son of Chung, son of Pierre, son of Fer- 
nando (we're actually talking about several tra- 
ditional societies). You might address him that 
way if you're going to announce his birth or 
marriage or challenge him to ritual combat, but 
most of the time all that stuff is just assumed; in 
normal conversation, you call him Fred. That 
isn't too hard, is it? —David Durkee

Fear and Loathing 
in Los Angeles: 

How Not To Write 
Documentation 

A fearless expose of the complex, thought-intensive, 
and high-minded profession of creating software docu- 
mentation for the masses (us). 

"Documentation . . . with a capital 'D' and 
that rhymes with 'T' and that stands for trou- 
ble. . . ." 

It was about three months ago that I received 
Holy Orders and was inducted into the High 
Priesthood of Documentatia. What started this 
entire misadventure was a newspaper clipping 
that someone sent me, listing the top ten person- 
al computer software companies. I thought it 
would be a good idea to send my resume to all 
ten companies. Two days later I was hired. 

I was dumped right in the middle of a hor- 
rendous documentation project. The company 
was developing an interesting-looking business 
application package for which the documenta- 
tion was only half done. Stressors were up. I 
was plunked down in a tiny office with two 
other writers, who were also new. There were 



two IBM PCs on my desk: one to run the soft- 
ware package under development and the other 
to write the documentation. There wasn't an 
Apple in the entire building! My predecessor 
had been fired, but no one would say exact- 
ly why. 

We all wrote as fast as we could, but it 
wasn't fast enough. 

It was time for the Hotel. 

It was my boss's idea. The plan was to lock 
the entire documentation team up in a suite for a 
week, where we would write untU we dropped. 
Anything that would distract us from our Mis- 
sion was taken care of. Food was brought up to 
us by Manuel of room service. The beds dropped 
out of the wall. Exercise was provided by watch- 
ing Twenty-Minute Workout. Glucose IVs were 
used to restore consciousness. A whip drove us 
back to WordStar. 

Gary was the first to crack. At first, no one 
could tell. He would just get up from his com- 
puter and walk across the room. But he never 
went anywhere. He just stopped in the middle of 
the room, then slowly lifted a leg and put it back 
down again a few times. He'd go back to his 
computer and the cycle would begin again a few 
hours later. After a few of these trips, I began to 
notice that he was mumbling something, rhyth- 
mically. 

"And one . . . " he said, lifting a leg. "And 
two ..." he added, putting it down. "And

take it to the left. ..." Here he thrust his hips 
suddenly to the left and began the leg-lifting on 
the other side of his body. 

Gary was starting to get a little carried 
away. His gyrations caught the attention of our 
boss, who said, "Oh, Gary, I think I've got a 
loose cable underneath this desk. Would you 
mind checking it for me?" 

"And one," he said, mindlessly making his 
way to the desk. "And two . . . ." He was now 
beneath the desk, his voice taking on an odd 
echoing effect. 

"And get back on your feetl'' the boss 
roared, sending Gary scrambling. There was a 
loud thump as Gary's head hit the top of the 
desk, then silence. The evening's entertainment 
done, the rest of us returned to work. 

By the fourth day, the men had stopped 
shaving and the women had stopped using 
makeup. A protective layer of aluminum can 
pop tops, room service receipts, potato chip 
shards, and discarded paper coated the carpet. 
There was a constant shuffling noise as people 
walked across the room. Some of us were be- 
ginning to display little eccentricities. I devel- 
oped an eye tick similar to that of Inspector 
Clouseau's boss. Linda began to stare off into 
space and absent-mindedly pick the fillings out 
of her teeth. Gary sat with an ice bag tied to his 
head, the ends sticking up, making him look 
like a misshapen mouse. The ice had long since 
evaporated, but Gary said he "liked the way it 
looked." 

Then there was Bryan. From the first day, 
we all had the distinct feeling that he wasn't to- 
tally committed to the program. He sat with his 
back to a comer, the PC in front of him and a. 
dense maze of chairs, wastepaper baskets, and 
ominous-looking electrical cables surrounding 
him. If you spoke to him, he just answered with 
strange, monosyllabic grunts. The odd green 
glow in his eyes told us that Strunk and White's 
The Elements of Style was not at the forefront of 
his mind. Sometimes we heard strange growling 
noises coming from his side of the room, and 
once we sent him careening to the window when 
we told him that there were "bats" flying 
around outside. 

Bryan never finished the project. He man- 
aged to bolt from the room on the fourth day 
when Manuel brought up the evening meal of 
Cheez Whiz and crackers. 

On the fifth and "final" day, the assistant 
boss brought us the good news, rewarding us 
for our long, hard hours: There were miles to 
go before we were to sleep. The room had been 
extended for another week. The job was yet to 
be finished. 

That night there was a hanging. Two PCs 
were now up for grabs. 

In an attempt to keep us all from going irre- 
trievably over the edge, I began to devise a se- 
ries of games that Manuel came to dread. The 
first was "Run the Gaundet." In this game, we 
called for room service; when Manuel opened 
the door, he was greeted by a long line of peo- 
ple dressed in white sheets. We stood facing 
each other, giving him a tunnel to push his little 
food cart along. Each of us held a lit candle that 
dramatically shadowed our faces. Saying noth- 
ing, we stared straight ahead. Gary the Mouse 
waited for Manuel at the end of the tunnel. 



beckoning to him like some disembodied spirit. 

"Come heeeeeeere," he said softly, waving 
a ghostlike finger. 

"Que?" Manuel said, bringing the slightly 
squeaking cart to a halt. 

"Assume the positionnnnnn," the Mouse 
intoned with a wicked-looking grin. 

Manuel began to back up, but it was too late. 
We all had our towels rolled up into tight little 
skin-splitting rolls. When he turned around and 
saw the new use we intended for the hotel linen, 
he began to scream and run for the door. 

Snapl The first towel cracked, making a 
stinging, direct hit on the back of his heavily em- 
broidered room service pants. Manuel leaped in 
the air and made another dash for freedom. 
Snap\ Sssnapl Two more kamikaze towels 
flashed in the air and made good hits. Manuel 
took several more snaps before he finally made 
it to the safety of the door and beyond. 

On our ninth and final day, all hell broke , 
loose. By this time there was a permanent green 
square in everyone's pupils from staring at the 
monitor. While I sat and typed, some movement 
out the windows to my right caught my eye. 

Window washers. 

In an instant, my fatigued mind put together 
the fact that they were a good ten stories above 
the ground, and yet they were free; they were 
outside! I knew what had to be done. They had 
to die. 

I tapped on the inch-thick glass and calmly 
said "Jump." They looked at me, laughed, and 
good-naturedly gave me an okay sign with their 
fingers. I wasn't getting my point across. I real- 
ly wanted to see them dive right off their plat- 
form. I wrote the word "JUMP" on one side of 
a piece of paper and the word "WIMPS!" on 
the other. I stood up and began to chant "Jump 
. . jump . . . jump" over and over again. The 
other writers heard it and began to join in. (Ac- 
tual writing had stopped some time ago, no one 
was sure exactly which day.) I held the paper in 
front of me and turned it over, displaying the 
"WIMPS!" message. We slowly staggered over 
to the window, arms outstretched, looking like 
the ghouls in the Michael Jackson Thriller 
video. The smiles faded from the window wash- 
ers' faces along with the color from their 
cheeks. I closed my eyes and heard, as if from a 
distance, the comforting cry of a loon. When I 
opened my eyes, the window washers were 
gone, ropes and all. 

I don't remember too much of what hap- 
pened next, except for a blur of activity around 
the room. I recall hands unscrewing every light 
bulb in sight, towels being stuffed in suitcases, 
tutorials being hastily scrawled on the toilet lid 
seats explaining high-speed flushing proce- 
dures, the shattering of glass, and fire hoses be- 
ing turned on, dragged along hallways, dropped, 
and left running. 

They say the documentation had to be 
picked up off the street where it had apparently 
been thrown from the tenth floor in what the 
Mouse cryptically termed "a noble experiment 
to determine which was heavier, documentation 
or paper." 

We finally got our reward: a week off to 
mend our paper cuts, detoxify from Epson print- 
er ink, and reduce the intensity of the green 
glow in our eyes. —Bill Parker

undreds of kids crowd around a school yard basket- 
ball court in Springfield, Massachusetts, where an 
advertising agency is setting up lights and cameras. 
The photographers want to capture an atmosphere of 



amateurism; they make sure the lights hit the graffiti on the walls 
near the court just right. Not knowing what's going on, the kids 
watch with curious eyes. 

A car pulls up, and out of it step Julius "Dr. J." Erving and 
Larry Bird, two of professional basketball's finest players. Those 
curious eyes grow to the size of tomatoes. As Erving and Bird 
play a pickup game of one-on-one, motor-driven camera shutters 
click ftiriously and bystanders watch in awe. The game taking 
place here may never take place again. Anywhere. 

Actually, the "game" is a photo session for the promotion 
and packaging of Julius Erving and Larry Bird Go One-on-One, 
an Electronic Arts game that is currently a bestseller. 

There's no doubt about it. The computer games industry is

growing up. It takes more than airbrush art and plastic-bag pack- 
aging to capture consumer interest. The games themselves are 
becoming more sophisticated, and so are the software companies 
that make them. 

The Maltese Hawk. In the early days of personal computing, 
software companies were things that sprang out of people's 
homes. Someone had an Apple and decided to make some money 
with it. That person wrote a program and marketed it, wrote an- 
other program and marketed it, and things grew from there— real 
rags-to-riches, American-dream-come-true stuff. 

If that's what a typical software company used to be like, then 
Electronic Arts is the antithesis of the old way. The company 
didn't come out of a garage; it sprang full-grown from Trip 
Hawkins's head. 

Hawkins is one of those guys who a lot of people love and re- 
sent at the same time for the same reason— almost everything he 
does, he does very well. He developed and marketed his first 
strategy board game at the age of eighteen. He attended Harvard 
as an undergraduate before earning his Master of Business Ad- 
ministration at Stanford. 

Steve Jobs hired him after reading an analysis Hawkins had 
written that predicted that the TRS-80 would be the market leader 
in 1978. The prediction came true. While at Apple, Hawkins ini- 



38 

tiated the company's push into the business market with the Apple 
n. He contracted programmers to develop Apple's first business 
software products. Hawkins was also the director of marketing 
for Apple's Lisa division (well, maybe not everything he touches 
turns to gold right away). On top of all that, he's been a member 
of Big Brothers of America for the past four years. 

Hawkins first saw a computer in 1972, and his initial reaction 
was that he wanted to play games on it. Not necessarily video 
games, but games that are interactive— games that use the com- 
puter as a communications medium. While computer technology 
developed in the seventies, he thought and dreamed about the time 
when it would be feasible to start a business in the personal com- 
puter industry. In 1975, he figured the right time would be 1982. 

Sure enough, when that year rolled around, Hawkins left Ap- 
ple Computer and started Electronic Arts (originally called 
Amazing Software, a name that caused many to roll their eyes 
and reach for a bicarbonate of soda). The first thing he should 
have done, following the traditional "rules" of setting up a soft- 
ware company, was write a great program and sell it in great 
quantifies. But Hawkins isn't a man who follows tradifion. 

Tradition Takes a Hike. Hawkins started from the top down. 
He hired Tim Mott, who spent five years at the Xerox Palo Alto 
Research Center and founded the division of Versatec that devel- 
oped and marketed computer-aided design graphics products for 
the Xerox Star. He also hired Richard Melmon, who was director 
of marketing at VisiCorp in the days when VisiCalc was riding 
high, and Eric Walter, former executive vice president of opera- 
tions at U.S.I. Intemafional. For good measure, he recruited Joe 
Ybarra, a bona fide game freak who was Apple's project director 
for Quick File, Apple Business Graphics, Access III, and the Chil- 
dren 's Television Workshop series. The list goes on. There's even 
a guy named Steve Wozniak who is a member of Electronic 
Arts's board of directors. 

Hawkins's idea was simple: If you're not the best in 
everything, find the best and get them to work for you. But to 
create a big and successful company, other things are necessary 
besides talent— such as money. Lots of it. 

Out-of-the-garage software companies usually raise about as 
much money as their founders have stuffed away in sugar bowls 
and mattresses. To fulfill the goals Hawkins had in mind, he 
needed a lot more than a few thousand dollars; he needed more 
like $2 million. Luckily, that was a year when the software indus- 
try was really getting hot, so Hawkins had little trouble persuad- 
ing Don Valentine— the same venture capitalist who gave Jobs 



AUGUST 1984 



and Wozniak their first bankroll— to invest in Electronic Arts. 

With management and capital secured, Electronic Arts still 
lacked one constituent: programmers. (To this day, the company 
still has no programmers. It prefers the term "software artist.") 

Again, Hawkins went with the philosophy of if you don't have 
the talent, hire people who do. Among the first software artists 
Electronic Arts lured to the company were Jon Freeman and 
Anne Westfall, Dan Bunten, and Bill Budge. Freeman and West- 
fall were top game designers with Automated Simulations; 
Bunten 's games were marketed by Strategic Simulations and 
made computer quarterbacks, cartel cutthroats, and cytron mas- 
ters out of thousands of Apple owners; and Bill Budge, well, he's 
Bill Budge. 

That was a little over a year ago. Since then. Electronic Arts's 
programs have appeared regularly on bestseller lists from Sof- 
talk's to Billboard's and have received awards from more than 
a dozen publications, including Rolling Stone, Omni, Computers 
and Electronics, and British Microcomputing 1984. 

Can a Computer Make You Bawl Your Head Off? From 
the beginning, Hawkins expected Electronic Arts to do well, but 
he never envisioned the success it has so far enjoyed. "Bill 
[Budge] used to say there really ought to be a 'great' software 
company," says Hawkins. While he doesn't think Electronic Arts 
has become great yet, Hawkins does feel it has taken some steps 
toward that goal. 

The first step was to promote a unique company image— an 
artistic image. Electronic Arts flew all its artists (eight at the 
time) to San Francisco and hired a photographer from the Los 
Angeles rock music scene to photograph them for a two-page 
magazine ad. 

Accompanied by the quesfion, "Can a computer make you 
cry?" the ad drew a lot of attenfion. Some were impressed, others 
confused. The ad asked, "Why do we love?" and "What are the 
touchstones of our emofions?" It likened the computer to a "uni- 
versal language of ideas and emotions. ' ' It was heady stuff from a 
company whose few products had only recently appeared on the 
market. 

Looking at the ad now, Hawkins admits that it went a little too 
far, but he does believe a computer can draw emotional responses 
and even make a person cry. ''Seven Cities of Gold pushes in the 
direction of where we want to go," says Hawkins. "It puts 
players in a moral dilemma of how to deal with new people [Az- 
tecs and Incas]. How do you feel when you're an intruder taking 
away their gold? How do you feel when you take their gold by

clobbering them? We don't have a program that's intent on making 
someone cry, but it's theoretically possible. Getting an emotional 
response is a function of the way people interact with software. 

"You can watch E.T. and the early silent films, and both 
make you cry. On Golden Pond is entertainment, but it's also 
more than that. People don't think of software like this . . . yet. It 
takes an effort to get out of the box most people are in." 

No Modem Needed. Electronic Arts believes the computer is 
a greater leap in communications than television was over radio 
and radio was over print. Not only do people communicate with 
themselves and with the machine, but they're also given a new 
kind of experience— interaction. 

Unfortunately for Apple owners, some of Electronic Arts's 
best products— such as M. U.L.E. and Archon—are made for the 
Atari computer because of its ability to accommodate multiple 
players. (Apple fans can take solace in the fact that Electronic 
Arts's artists much prefer to develop products on the Apple and 
then translate them for other machines.) Multiple-player games 
are the best, Hawkins feels, because they allow the computer to 
be a medium that fosters interaction between human players— and 
that's the machine's true strength. 

One of Electronic Arts's prime goals is to make the computer 
an educational tool. Hawkins, a fan of philosopher and educator 
John Dewey, believes that "the act of using your mind is more 
important than the topic you're studying." That is, learning 
should be based on experience. To that end. Electronic Arts's 
programs (especially games) try to include a secondary educational 
value that's all but invisible to the person using the program. 

Simple, hot, and deep. Those are the words and concepts 
around which Electronic Arts strives to build its software. A pro- 
gram has to be simple enough for people to get started; it has to be 
hot, so they'll stick with it; and it has to be deep, or there's no- 
where to go. The idea is that people learn best when their first ex- 
posure to an experience is easily absorbed, when the material is in 
a medium that requires participation, and the player is led to in- 
vestigate and learn voluntarily. 

Despite Electronic Arts's aspirations of turning the computer 
into an educational aide, the company's goal isn't simply to satis- 
fy one's curiosity about a subject; rather, the goal is to stimulate 
curiosity itself. Music Construction Set doesn't teach music; it 
piques the curiosity of players so that they'll want to find out 
more on their own and possibly decide to learn a musical instru- 
ment. Likewise, Ybarra hopes that by playing One-on-One, peo- 
ple will be motivated to practice jump shots and lay-ups— not on 
the computer screen but in the driveway or school yard. 

Social interaction, according to Hawkins, is important to mak- 
ing the computer a success. And Electronic Arts doesn't limit that 
idea to computer games; it also practices the idea in the work 
environment. 

The World According to Trip. Hawkins is a true believer in 
culture (versus bureaucracy and autocracy) as the most powerful 
form of organization. "All cultures have a collection of values 
that are passed from one generation to the next. What bonds the 
group is a set of beliefs, as well as the ritualizations and celebra- 
tions of those beliefs. The result is that everyone is allowed to act 
independently, but they do so according to the culture's values." 

If this sounds like Hawkins is developing a culture of his own, 
well, maybe he is. -Every one from Electronic Arts's receptionist 
to the chief financial officer strongly believes in the company's 
goal to be a part of "fulfilling the promise of home computing"— 
the promise that the personal computer will be the most powerful 
tool yet devised for the amusement and advancement of mankind. 

The people at Electronic Arts work hard, but they also play 
hard. On May 20, 1983, in order to deliver its first products in a 
timely fashion, Hawkins took the entire thirty -person company to 
its South San Francisco warehouse, where the group spent a good 



part of the day packing and shipping boxes and playing Nerf base- 
ball while waiting for the United Parcel Service trucks to arrive. 
Later, to celebrate the occasion of getting its products out the 
door, Hawkins rented an entire theater for a private screening of 
Return of the Jedi, with friends and vendors also in attendance. 

A few months ago, Hawkins flew Electronic Arts software ar- 
tists to San Francisco for the company's first Artist Symposium 
and required that all personnel be on hand to greet the artists as 
they arrived. Then, when everyone was present, he packed them 
onto buses with champagne and a catered lunch, and the whole 
group went to see the opening of Indiana Jones and the Temple of 
Doom. 

This is a top software company? Yes, but it's also a group of 
people who take their work very seriously without taking them- 
selves too seriously. Walking through Electronic Arts's office, 
it's hard not to notice the Nerf balls that lie casually in the con- 
ference room and on desk tops. These aren't toys. They were 
given to employees as part of a stress-reduction program. Today, 
when tensions rise, the Nerf balls fly. 

Backcourt Pressure. Pressure situations can sometimes bring 
their own rewards. The best example is the nightmares and re- 
wards that came with developing Julius Erving and Larry Bird Go 
One-on-One. 

Hawkins remembers how Eric Hammond quickly fell behind 
in the project by spending too many days at the beach in southern 
California; Joe Ybarra, producer of the project, remembers argu- 
ing with Hammond about whether certain improvements could be 
made, while trying desperately to get the program finished before 
the holiday season; Hammond remembers dinners and breakfasts 
at the local Denny's restaurant while he was literally living at 
Electronic Arts's office; and all of them remember the thrill of 
meeting two of basketball's greatest forwards. 

Erving 's philosophies impressed Hawkins so much that he

adapted them to his management style. Such wisdom includes:

you're open to the feeling that there is no limit, then there is no

that came a close second to playing some real-life one-on-one

No Reaching In. A strong point of Electronic Arts is the com- 
pany's knack for exciting people enough to join the team. At the 
same time, though, the company has gotten— in the eyes of some 
competitors— the image of a firm that raids other companies and 
steals programmers. Hawkins says the image is unwarranted. 

In late 1982, Electronic Arts producers began contacting pro- 
grammers they knew who were talented and didn't have ties with 
other companies. Hard Hat Mack coauthor Mike Abbot had left 
Cavalier Computer; Freeman and Westfall had left Automated 
Simulations and started Free Fall Associates; Bunten was becom- 
ing dissatisfied with publishing his games through Strategic 
Simulations; Budge was floating around wondering whether his 
company BudgeCo was worth the effort he was putting into it. 

The hardest part, according to producer Dave Evans, was 
convincing prospective artists that Electronic Arts would suc- 
ceed, even though the company didn't yet exist. "There were 
quite a few who were skeptical about us and turned us down. 
Now that they've seen what we can do, they're coming back." 

Evans says that when trying to find artists, Electronic Arts 
takes care not to step on the toes of other companies. ' 'If someone

has a contract or agreement with another company, we don't want 
to pursue the matter. If he's willing to break agreements in order 
to come work with us, that's not the kind of person we want." 

To the criticism that Electronic Arts hasn't any programmers 
of its own, Ybarra replies that it's accurate and inaccurate. On 
one hand, the talent that creates Electronic Arts's products for the 
consumer market all comes from outside. Innovative ideas, the 
company believes, are more likely to come from people who 
don't work in a software "factory" or company bureaucracy. On 
the other hand, Electronic Arts does have a research and develop- 
ment department that devotes its time to working on graphics 
tools, sound routines, game kernels, user-interface designs, and 
other resources for artists to use. 

Uncovering the Unknowns. Electronic Arts is also interested 
in discovering unknown artists, a process as time-consuming as it 
is fruitful. Producers sift through mountains of unsolicited mate- 
rial, make presentations at user groups, receive referrals from 
other programmers, and keep in touch with a network of friends 
in the software business. As in the music industry, the discovery 
of new talent often happens by chance. 

Producer Stewart Bonn remembers how he almost lost Music 
Construction Set artist Will Harvey when the boy wonder was 
literally right in front of him. Bill Budge had looked at some pro- 
grams Harvey had written and recommended that Harvey take 
them to Electronic Arts. Bonn looked at a few of them but told 
Harvey that none of them were quite what Electronic Arts had in 
mind at the moment. If it seemed like he was giving Harvey a po- 
lite rejection, it was only because Bonn had just seen "this in- 
credible music demonstration program for the Mockingboard" at 
the Boston Applefest and was trying desperately to find the per- 
son who wrote the program. When the search began looking 
hopeless, he asked Harvey what else he had, and Harvey re- 
plied, "Well, I have this music thing. ..." The rest is soft- 
ware history. 

According to Ybarra, even the most talented people have a 
distance to go before pushing the personal computer to its limits. 
"What the software industry needs is the equivalent to what Star 
Wars was to the film industry. There have been some shots at it, 
but the industry is so primitive that even the classic programs are 
feeble compared to what can be done on big computers." 

Encouraging software artists who learned programming on 
the Apple is fine, but Electronic Arts also wants to persuade com- 
puter scientists (those sages who were raised on mainframe and 
minicomputers) to bring their knowledge to the micro industry 
and provide it with a software shot in the arm. 

"The only way to do that is to be a professional organiza- 
tion," says 'iTjarra. "Considering the high salaries and suppor- 
tive environments that professionals demand, it's apparent that the 
[micro] marketplace isn't ready to support it, but it's coming very 
fast." 

See Farther, Not Far-Sighted. When you look at the visions 
and goals that Electronic Arts has, you come to one of two con- 
clusions: Either this is a company that has its head in the clouds, 
or it's a company that knows the direction in which the personal 
computer industry is headed. 

Being different invites criticism. But no matter how much 
Electronic Arts can be criticized for being too idealistic, or for 
taking a moralistic approach to a hobbyist industry, it can't be ac- 
cused of having the wrong ideas. 

True, Electronic Arts perhaps represents the beginning of the 
end of the cottage industry. The company is a good example of 
professionals pushing their way into an area where inspired 
amateurs are heroes. Electronic Arts acknowledges the land- 
marks left by pioneers of the industry, but it also feels the time 
has come to take microcomputers out of the cottage and bring 
them to the world— a goal that is admirable, at the very least.

Drawing a Bead on Text Files 



Last month DOStalk explored some of the intricacies of DOS's text 
file conmiands. We closely examined old friends such as open, read, 
write, and close. This month we're going to continue this investigation, 
with emphasis on the parameters that can be used with these commands. 

Imagine, for the moment, a bag of marbles. There are important dif- 
ferences between a file full of characters and a bag full of marbles, al- 
though they may not be immediately obvious. 

If you shake up a bag of marbles ten times, and after each shake open 
the bag and examine the top marble, you'll probably find a different mar- 
ble on top each time. 

But if you do the same thing to a file, the first character out of the file 
will always be the same one. 

In addition, the second character out of the file will always be the 
same, as wUl the third, and so on; but the second marble out of the bag 
one time might be the seventeeth one out the next time. 

So let's take all our marbles, drill holes in them, string them together 
like beads, and put them back in the bag. Now we have something more 
like a file. A string of beads could be pulled out of the bag the same way 
every time, just like a file of characters. 

Simple text files don't amount to much more than a string of beads in 
a bag. The beads come in 128 colors, one for each ASCII character. 
When you write a simple text file, you are simply stringing the beads to- 
gether. When you read a simple text file, you take the beads out of the 
bag and translate them back into characters. 

This kind of file is called a sequential file. Sequential files are good 
for computerized information that you store and retrieve all in one hunk. 
As this column was developed, for example, it was stored in a sequential 
text file. The entire file had to be loaded into a word processor before so 
much as one character could be changed. After a change, the entire file 
had to be resaved. This is a simple, effective technique for dealing with 
the development of DOStalks, since many changes are usually made to 
the file, in random places, each time it is loaded. 

For other kinds of files, however, a simple sequential structure is of- 
ten inadequate. Imagine Brother Bob's furniture inventory (substitute 
your favorite fast-talking advertiser if you like). Brother Bob has a list 
somewhere that goes something like this: 

cheap red sofas 4 
cheap yellow sofas 1 2 
really cheap red sofas 6 



really cheap blue sofas 1 
and so on. . . . 

The numbers represent how many of each item ol' Brother Bob has 
on hand. If he gets in a new shipment of five cheap red sofas, for exam- 
ple, that first 4 will have to be changed to a 9. In this situation, it would 
be nice if Brother Bob could go directly to the part of the file about cheap 
red sofas, change just that number, and leave the rest of the file un- 
touched. 

To do this easily, we need to invent a way to jump from one part of 
our bead string to another part. Pull that long string of beads out of that 
big bag ovei* there, and let's look into this a little. 

Extend the string out on a table. Now imagine that the beads at the be- 
ginning of the string have the numbers on Brother Bob's overstuffed mat- 
tresses and the beads at the end of the string hold a count of love seats. 
Somewhere in the middle are our sofas. Now just imagine that we hap- 
pened to know that cheap red sofas were item number 77 in the string, 
and that each item had been allotted exactly thirty beads. 

A little quick math (77 * 30) would tell us that cheap red sofas start at 
bead 2,310. Furthermore, if we knew that names took up the first twenty- 
five beads of each item's allotted thirty, and that the quantity on hand 
was stored in the last five beads, we could do a little more math (2,3 10 -f- 
25) and know exactly where to find the number of cheap red sofas in 
Brother Bob's inventory. 

This same kind of math works with files as well as beads. Both DOS 
3.3 and ProDOS use a position-in-file pointer that designates the current 
bead position. When you read from or write to a file, this pointer auto- 
matically moves down the string. When working with simple sequential 
files, this is the only method used for moving the pointer. 

As Brother Bob knows, however, there are other ways to move the 
pointer around. Opening a file always moves the pointer to the file's be- 
ginning. The append command moves it to the file's end. The read and 
write commands' R and B parameters, in conjunction with open's L pa- 
rameter, allow you to move the pointer anywhere you like. 

What the L (Is All About). It is helpful in this context to remember 
that the DOS read and write commands don't actually read or write any- 
thing. The read command tells DOS to supply data from the specified file 
to any subsequent input or get commands. If you use the R or B 
parameters with read, you are also telling DOS to move the file pointer 
before supplying data. 



44 



WU lAI 1/ 



AUGUST 1984 



Similarly, the write command tells DOS to place anything subse- 
quently printed in the specified file, at the position specified by the R and 
B parameters. 

When you open a file, you can specify a length parameter for DOS to 
use with that file. The length parameter represents the number of beads, 
or bytes, allotted to each item, or record, in the file. Brother Bob 
specifies his record length like this: 

520 PRINT "OPEN BEDBUGS, L30" 

With either DOS 3.3 or Pro DOS you can use any length value you 
like when you open a file. Just because a file was originally opened with 
one value doesn't mean you can't reopen it later with another value. Do- 
ing so may cause you all kinds of confusion, but Uncle DOS insists it's 
your confiision— he knows what he's doing. (There really are reasons 
you might do this that we'll get to in a moment.) 

DOS 3.3, in fact, doesn't even keep track of what record length you 
use when you originally open a file. You have to remember that yourself. 
ProDOS, on the other hand, does keep track of it. You can determine the 
record length that a file was created with by using the ProDOS catalog 
command. The fmal entry on each line of the catalog, the entry in the col- 
umn labeled subtype, is where you'll find this information. For some 
reason known only to the ProDOS development team, the L parameter 
used when the file was created appears there with the prefix R = . 

If you neglect to specify an L value when you open a file, DOS 3.3 
will automatically set it to one. ProDOS, on the other hand, will set it to 
whatever was specified when the file was created. If you open a new file 
with ProDOS without specifying an L value, the file will be assigned a 
length of zero (last month we said it would be one— we were wrong). 
Under ProDOS, files with a length of zero are considered sequential 
files; all others are considered random-access files. DOS 3.3, on the 
other hand, will not accept a length of zero— you'll get beeped with a 
range error if you try it. 

At any rate, the length value you assign to a file is absolutely mean-

ingless in and of itself. It has meaning only when you also specify a rec- 
ord parameter with a read or write command. The L and R parameters 
always work together— either one alone is useless. 

R You Ready for This? When you use the R parameter with read or 
write, the pointer for the specified file is moved according to the follow- 
ing formula: 

POINTER = (L * R) 

If you open a file with L specified as one, you can use R to move the 
file's pointer to any byte in the file. The first byte in the file is always 
called byte zero. Specify R as zero and the pointer gets set to the (1 * 0) 
byte. Specify one and the pointer moves to (1 * 1). Specify 2310 and the 
pointer moves to (1 * 2310). Using this technique, you can move the 
pointer to any byte of the fde within the range of the R parameter (32767 
for DOS 3.3; 65535 for ProDOS). To reach beyond that, open the file 
with a slightly bigger L value and do the appropriate math. 

Brother Bob doesn't use this technique because he hates math. He 
would much rather open the file with a length of 30 and then tell DOS he 
wants to access record 77. There are a few crazy people around, how- 
ever, who think it's fun to have Applesoft multiply the record length by 
the record number and give the total to DOS. Gives them a feeling of 
control, they say. Either way, the results are the same. Multiplication, 
after all, is multiplication. 

Two Bs or Not Two Bs? Folks who like to have lots of control over 
the file pointer can also move it around with the byte parameter. They 
rarely do, however, because the B parameter is treated like a problem 
child in Apple's DOS instructions. 

In the original DOS 3.3 documentation, called The DOS Manual, 
there was a two-page section on the B parameter which began, "Note: 
the following section is not for beginners . . . ", and which consisted 
mostly of warnings about all the problems you could create by using the 
B parameter inappropriately. 

In the later DOS Programmer 's Manual, this two-page section is 
missing. What little information on B that is presented in this book is 
only partially correct. 

In Basic Programming with ProDOS, the B parameter loses even its 
entry in the index. No examples of how to use tiie parameter are given. 

Nonetheless, the B parameter is a reliable little critter that can be 
quite useful if you know how to use it. 

As originally designed, the B parameter is supposed to allow you to 
bump the file pointer a specific number of bytes beyond the beginning of 
the file (sequential files) or the beginning of a record (random files). 
Brother Bob, for example, actually reads the cheap red sofa data with 
commands like these: 

520 PRINT "OPEN BEDBUG, L30" 
525 PRINT "READ BEDBUG, R77, B25" 

As long as you take the proper precautions (to be explained momen- 
tarily), the B parameter always enters the pointer-positioning formula in 
a very precise way. The formula becomes: 

POINTER = (L * R) + B 

Something most people don't realize is that the B parameter can be 
used to move the pointer vast distances as well as to tap it slightly. For 
example, it is entirely possible to have a file that consists of four 
2,500-byte sequential sections and 400 30-byte records. To access the 
various parts of the file you would use commands like these: 

540 PRINT "OPEN CURIOSITY, L30" 

550 PRINT "READ CURIOSITY, RO, BO" 1st sequential section 
550 PRINT "READ CURIOSITY, RO, B2500" 2nd sequential section 
550 PRINT "READ CURIOSITY, RO, B5000" 3rd sequential section 
550 PRINT "READ CURIOSITY, RO, B7500" 4th sequential section 
550 PRINT "READ CURIOSITY, RO, B10000" record zero 
550 PRINT "READ CURIOSITY, R100, record 100 

B10000" 

The final command may puzzle you. It appears we are trying to read 
10,000 bytes beyond the beginning of record 100. In fact we are skipping 
over the 10,000 sequential bytes at the beginning of the file and then go- 
ing to record 100. This works because (30 * 100) -I- 10000 (what we 
specify in the conunand) is mathematically the same as 10(X)0 -I- (30 * 
100) (the fde position we actually want).

Inspiration is fleeting so just let your thoughts flow. 
The flexible format makes it easy to rearrange them 
later into headings and a basic outline. 




Use as many headings and as much text as you need 
to develop the outline fully. ThinkTank's processing 
power can move whole sections of text with a single 
keystroke— something no word processor can do. 




When you want to scope the Big Picture, a simple 
command drops out everything but the main headings 
Subheads and detailed text are stored for recall later. 



Go ahead. 

Put your two cents worth onto ThinkTank™ 
And watch it grow into a million-dollar idea. 

Because ThinkTank is the first software 
designed to process ideas. Available on the Apple II 
family of computers. 

ThinkTank's flexible outline format lets you 
clearly see your idea from all angles. So you can 
sharpen up an inspired thought, weed out a weak 
one, set priorities, weigh alternatives. 

It s like a spreadsheet for ideas. 

While all this structuring helps your brain- 
child take shape, it won't inhibit the natural flow 
of creative juices. Because entering an idea onto 
ThinkTank is as easy as scribbling it on a cocktail 
napkin. All you need is simple English. 

Just let your thoughts flow— from "pie in 
the sky" concepts to the "nuts and bolts" details. 
And build more professional proposals, 
marketing plans, legal 
briefs, case reports, 
engineering specifica- 
tions, research notes, 
action items, hot

Note carefully that each of the commands shown previously includes 
both the R and B parameters. This is the precaution you should take 
when using B— never use it alone. Always specify R when you use B. If 
you are dealing with a sequential file, where R is usually not used, 
specify R as zero. 

If you are using DOS 3.3 and you neglect to specify R, you will run 
into trouble because R will sometimes default to unexpected, nonzero 
numbers. When these numbers enter the calculation, the pointer gets 
moved to unexpected, nonuseful places. 

If you are using ProDOS and you neglect to specify R, the file pointer 
moves B bytes beyond the current pointer position. You can get your 
name in DOStalk if you send us a practical application for this feature— 
we can't think of any. 

With DOS 3.3, the minimum B value is zero, the maximum is 
32,767. With ProDOS the minimum B value is again zero but the maxi- 
mum value varies. At any moment it is the difference between the cur- 
rent file position and the last byte in the file. (Thus, if the pointer is at the 
end of your file, the maximum allowable B value is zero.) With ProDOS 
you can't use B to move the pointer beyond the end of the file. If you try 
you'll get a range error, even when writing. DOS 3.3 doesn't have this 
disability. You can get around it in ProDOS. Simply open a file and use 
big L and R values with a write and a print to move the end of the file into 
hyperspace. 

The accompanying figure summarizes the possible values you can use 
with the L, R, and B parameters for both DOS 3.3 and ProDOS. Note 
that under ProDOS the largest record number you can have is the smaller 
of 65,535 records or sixteen megabytes (16,777,216 bytes— the largest 
possible ProDOS file) divided by the record length. If, for example, your 
records were 1,000 bytes long, the maximum record number you could 
have would be 16,777. 

Bad Field Position. Another way to move the position-in-file pointer 
is with the position command. You can use position to move the pointer 
forward (only— never backward) a specified number of fields. A field is 
a bunch of characters that end with a carriage return. DOS places no 
limit on the maximum number of characters in a field, although if you in- 
tend to read your file with Basic input statements you'd better not exceed 
input's 239-character limitation. A field can contain as few characters as 
none; this happens when you have two carriage returns in a row. 

With DOS 3.3 you use the R parameter to specify how many fields 
position should skip over. If you specify zero, the pointer won't move at 
all. If you specify one, Uncle DOS will zip through the file's characters 
from the current position to the next return— the pointer will end up at the 
first character following the return. If you specify two, DOS will stop 
after two returns, and so on. 

Position's R parameter stands for relative field position. There is ab- 
solutely no relationship between position's relative fields and read and 
write 's record numbers, even though they share the R parameter. To 
minimize some of the confusion about all this, ProDOS has an F parame- 
ter that works just like position's relative fields. 

With ProDOS, the F parameter can also be used with read and write 
commands. This makes the position command itself unnecessary — it was 
included in ProDOS only for DOS 3.3 compatibility. 

Imagine you want to move the file pointer to record 93 of a file and

then read the second field. Here's how you do it: 
525 PRINT "READ SUNTAN, R93, F1" 

You set F to 1 because you want to skip one field. This puts you at the 
beginning of the second field. 

In actual practice, the position command and the F parameter usually 
create more confiision than they dissipate. Their existence makes it ap- 
pear that a file organized as a series of variable-length fields can be use- 
fully accessed one field at a time. DOStalk doubts this. 

Say a file has a field with a ten-character name in it. If you replace 
that ten-character name with a five-character name, you'll create two 
fields — one with the new five-character name, one with the final charac- 
ters of the old ten-character name. 

Similarly, if you overwrite an existing field with a longer name, 
you'll destroy part of the following field. Consider these problems 
awhile and you'll probably come to the conclusion that files with fields 
that need to be accessed one at a time need fixed-length, not variable- 
length, fields. Fixed-length fields can be accessed more easily and 
quickly with the B parameter than with position or the F parameter. 

If you decide to ignore our warnings about the uselessness of posi- 
tion, remember that it always starts counting from the current file posi- 
tion. If the pointer is in a record's tenth field and you specify R as two, 
you end up at the beginning of the twelfth field. You can't go backward. 
To get to a record's second field if you're starting at the tenth, you must 
first reset the pointer to the beginning of the record and then use position 
or the F parameter. 

This gets very tricky, since a position command will turn off the read 
or write command you use to specify the record you want. The solution 
is to use a second read or write, after the position command. When you 
execute the second read or write you'll want to leave the file pointer right 
where it is, so don't use any parameters with it. 

That's it for this month. Brother Bob says to tell you he'll pay you the 
difference in cash if you can find a cheaper parameter anywhere in the 
city. See you next time. HI

□ ComputerLand (Oakland, CA) and Apple 
Computer (Cupertino, CA) have jointly an- 
nounced that, beginning this month, qualifying 
ComputerLand franchises in the U.S. and Can- 
ada will begin carrying the complete Apple line 
of computers— the Apple lie, lie, and III, the 
Macintosh, and the Lisa 2 series. "We believe 
our distribution strength and competitive posi- 
tion will be enhanced by our agreement with 
ComputerLand," says Apple president John 
Scully. The added franchises "will provide us 
with a market presence in geographic areas not 
presently represented by Apple." About one- 
half of ComputerLand's 540 stores in the U.S. 
are already authorized Apple dealers. Comput- 
erLand currently has stores in twenty-five coun- 
tries. Shipments of the Apple line to those fran- 
chises are expected to begin in the near future. 

□ Apple Computer (Cupertino, CA) is seek- 
ing Japanese software writers to design pro- 
grams for the Lisa and Macintosh. Apple 
doesn't have any Japanese-language programs 
and hopes to promote sales of Apples in Japan. 
Twice as expensive as they are here, only thirty 
or forty thousand Apple lis have been sold in 
Japan out of 1.5 million sold worldwide. In 



other news, Apple is scrapping its retailing mid- 
dlemen. As of October 1 , the contracts of some 
two dozen manufacturer's representatives will 
not be renewed. Apple will work directly with 
its eighteen hundred dealers throughout the 
U.S. and Canada. The change is expected to 
bring about a closer working relationship be- 
tween the company and its customer base. And 
Alan Kay, the inventor of windows and the 
Dynabook concept at the Xerox Palo Alto Re- 
search Center, has become a member of Ap- 
ple's prestigious Apple Fellows— a club that 
also includes Steve Wozniak, Bill Atkinson, 
Rod Holt (who designed the power supply for 
the n), and Richard Page (who first touted the 
68000 chip and spearheaded the Lisa software 
development team). The Apple Fellows are the 
technical equivalent of vice presidents in Ap- 
ple's management team. They are given renew- 
able sabbaticals of one year to do research and 
also get hefty bonuses, options, and other good- 
ies. Kay's last job was as chief scientist at Atari. 
□ According to testimony by the U.S. Army's 
general staff before Congress, the Pentagon 
(Washington, DC) used Apples in its recent war 
games with NATO forces in Europe. The rea-

son given by officers for opting for a bunch of 
Apples, which handled the nuclear targeting 
chores just fine, was that "the procurement cy- 
cle for military-specification machines took too 
long." The Apples were an "interim" solution 
for the military until its "ruggedized, nuclear 
radiation-proof, customized machines ... at 
ten times die cost" arrived in Washington. 

□ VisiCorp (San Jose, CA) has announced 
that its president and chief operating officer, 
Terry Opdendyk, has resigned to "pursue an- 
other business opportunity." Chairman and 
chief executive officer Daniel H. Fylstra will 
assume Opdendyk' s responsibilities. A spokes- 
person said Opdendyk's departure is unrelated 
to the trouble the company has had recently. 
Earlier this year, VisiCorp laid off about forty 
workers. Opdendyk's resignation "wasn't real- 
ly a surprise," the spokesperson said. His de- 
parture won't have a significant effect on the 
company's operation. Fylstra and Opdendyk 
have worked together closely since 1980, "so 
there won't be a rocky transition." 

□ Franklin Computer (Pennsauken, NJ) has 
filed for Chapter 1 1 bankruptcy as legal protec- 
tion from an estimated several hundred credi- 
tors. "There were three reasons for the bank- 
ruptcy filing," said Joel Shusterman, com- 
pany president. "There was a softening of the 
marketplace. There was a financial squeeze be- 
cause of the Apple Computer setdement. And a 
rebound in sales that we expected did not ma- 
terialize." Last January, Apple Computer won 
a $2.5-million suit alleging Franklin's Ace 1000 
and Ace 1200 infringed on Apple copyrights. 
More recently. Franklin was forced to lay off 
160 of its 275 employees. Shusterman also said 
a new Franklin computer called the CX will be 
released soon, although the computer's intro- 
duction has been delayed several months due to 
a shortage of parts. 

□ Two games in the Wizware series from 
Scholastic (New York, NY) are part of the As-

currently on a two-year tour of American sci- 
ence museums, combines interactive computer 
displays, robotics, historical objects, audio- 
visual presentations, pictures, and text. The 
games are featured in the Bright Games section, 
an introduction to computerized education.

Flashl We interrupt this catalog . . . 

... to bring you all the information it has in it. Not just on the 
screen where you can see it, mind you. There's no news in that. At last, 
all that good data can be put where Applesoft programmers can utilize it. 

DOSlink may be the solution to the last big obstacle facing the in- 
termediate programmer writing his or her own custom databases, 
catalogs, disk utilities, or any programs that need to know the contents of 
a data disk. It is a short machine language interface that sets itself up 
(with a little help from its friends) between DOS and its buffers and reads 
all the information returned by the normal DOS 3.3 catalog command in- 
to known Applesoft variables. 

But First, a Word from Our Author. . . . Before this goes any fur- 
ther, we wish to disavow any appreciable expertise in assembly language 
programming. This program is short for its apparent power because it 
taps seven DOS, six Applesoft, and three Monitor routines to do all of its 
work— that's where all the real "programming" was done. It is ripe for 
all sorts of additions by those who really do know what they are doing as 
well as those who are just learning— so have at it! 



an assembly source, remember that the ORG (the starting point) of the 
code is $9B6C. Since that will overwrite the DOS file buffers, the crxie 
cannot be entered initially at the location where it is designed to run. It 
would be a good idea to enter the code at $1B6C so that the last three hex 
digits could be used to confirm the accuracy of program entry when 
proofreading and debugging. If you use this method, you should type 
bsave DOSlink at $IB6C,A$1B6C,L404 when your entry is complete. To 
brun the program with this code, it will be necessary to use the command 
brun DOSlink at $1B6C,A$9B6C. This should be substituted for the 
command brun DOSlink used later in this article and in the DOSlink 
Demo program. 

DOSlink was written using the Big Mac assembler. The DOSlink 
listing contains fairly complete comments on the operation of the pro- 
gram. This program is so simple in operation that the vast majority of the 
op-codes are standard 6502 mnemonics. Two notes of explanation may 
be of help to users of other assemblers. First, the DS pseudo op-code 
stands for data storage and is just a means of reserving bytes to be used 
by program variables during operation. For assemblers without this

A Catalog of Values! 

byJohnA.Oakey 



DOSlink is the result of frustration (1 percent), tempered by the cer- 
tainty that visible forms are the result of operative functions, and a lot of 
research coupled with trial-and-error experimentation (99 percent). It is 
a synthesis of information found in Beneath Apple DOS by Don Worth 
and Pieter Lechner; the Assembly Lines column by Roger Wagner in the 
February 1982 Softalk; "Applesoft Internal Entry Points" by John 
Crossley in All About Applesoft; Apple II Monitors Peeled; The DOS 
Manual; and Applesoft Basic Programmer's Reference Manual. The 
references are listed in order of their importance to the creation of the 
program. 

And Now— On with the Show! Before doing something to DOS, 
let's arrange a way to undo it if we need to later. Prepare to experience 
the easiest of all program creations. After booting normal, unpatched- 
in-any-way DOS 3.3 from a newly initialized disk in a 48K (at least) 
Apple (have all the bases been covered?), type bsave Catalog Restore, 
A$ADB3, L$AA. That's it. 

What you have just done is save a pristine copy of the section of DOS 
that is largely responsible for producing that show of shows, the catalog. 
DOSlink will ' 'hook' ' into or otherwise modify seven areas inside that 
region in the process of setting itself up. All the damage can be repaired 
with the conmiand bload Catalog Restore. Caveat: blood, not brun. The 
only thing not repaired is the init command— better safe than sorry. 

For those who prefer to type the code in directly instead of creating 



function, HEX 00 00 (or a similar command to specify a pair of labeled 
bytes) will serve just as well. Second, when Big Mac's pseudo op-code 
command ASC delimits its operand string with a single quote, it places 
the string into memory in positive ASCII (high bits off). This is the way 
Applesoft expects to find its text information. 

Look Out Boys— It's a Setup! Your program should brun DOSlink 
before defining any string variables. Subsequently, the arrays LK$, SE, 
FT$, and FI$ should be dimensioned before you issue the catalog com- 
mand. Otherwise, those arrays will be automatically dimensioned by the 
Applesoft PTRGET routine to hold only ten entries of file information. 
This will lead to poor reviews from the Applesoft command interpreter 
when a disk with more than ten files (for technical reasons DOSlink 
doesn't use the zero array variable) is catalogued. 

Getting DOSlink into operation can be a real one-liner. Here is a line 
that might work: 

1 PRINT CHR$(4)"BRUN DOSLINK": DIM LK$(105), Fl$(105), FT$(105), 
SE(105) 

Note the use of CHR$(4). The D$ convention for executing DOS 
commands requires the defining of a string, which should not be done 
prior to bruning DOSlink. 

After this short setup, any catalog command (as in print 
CHR$ (4) "catalog") will result in Applesoft variables holding all the

catalog information as shown in the accompanying table. 

Filling these variable arrays is accomplished in the spaces of time be- 
tween the output of each character of the catalog. With all this extra ac- 
tivity, you would think the catalog would be slow in delivering its lines to 
the screen. The first time you try it you may be a bit surprised that it ac- 
tually looks just as fast as usual. This is an illusion (shades of Bill 
Budge!) caused by the removal of the expected pause in the catalog and 
perhaps somewhat lowered expectations. There is a delay, but its brevity 
is one of the big advantages to using machine language. 

Get Yer Programs Here— Only $194! DOSlink initially loads into 
the $194 (decimal 404) bytes from $9B6C to $9CFF. At the end of its 
setup, however, it has DOS rebuild its buffers over the first $79 (121) 
bytes, which constitute the setup front end. This means that, in actual ex- 
ecution, DOSlink occupies only $11B (283) bytes— just over one disk 
sector or "page" of memory! Four zero-page bytes are also used: $FC, 
$FD, $FE, and $FF. $FE and $FF must be left undisturbed after the pro- 
gram is set up or DOSlink will not function properly. They hold a pointer 
to the value of FC% , which is needed before and during each catalog.

code of DOSlink. Parts one and two go into the section of DOS that per- 
forms the catalog. They prepare DOSlink to work much of its magic by a 
bit of redirection. Part one sets up hooks in six places so that DOSlink 
will be able to pick up the data being displayed and removes the catalog's 
pause. Part two rebuilds the DOS buffers just below part three, reclaim- 
ing the memory that held the setup routine. Along the way, the init com- 
mand is disabled, the RAM location for the variable FC% is found, and 
its address is stored in $FE and $FF. While the Catalog Restore program 
we saved a while ago reverses most of this process, bloading it will not 
restore init. 

In line 141 at the begirming of part three, the first use is made of the 
SAVE routine in the Apple's Monitor. This routine places all the 6502's 
register values in zero page beginning at $45. Each time a piece of infor- 
mation is fetched to DOSlink, the first thing done is to call SAVE. Con- 
versely, the last thing done before returning to continue the catalog 
routine is to utilize SAVE's alter ego, RESTORE, which reverses the 
process. Old "Uncle DOS" never knows we've been gone. 

The reinitialization of DOSlink each time it is used is made relatively 
simple by the DOS catalog routine's printing of the disk volume number. 
This is an action performed only once per catalog, at the very beginning 
of the routine, which is exactiy what is needed. 

In lines 144 through 151, the Applesoft text pointer is saved and the 
pointer to FC%, which was found in part one, is used to reset FC% to 
zero. Note that only the least significant byte of FC% is ever used, since 
DOS will only allow 105 entries in a disk catalog and one byte can be in- 
cremented up to 255 . The moral of this bit of trivia is that if you utilize 
FC% in some manner that assigns it a value greater than 255, and then 
issue a catalog command, the bluebird of happiness will not remain 
perched outside your window. 

In line 153, the value of the disk volume is copied from $44 (A5L), 
where the catalog routine stored it, into the Y register and floated using 
one of the nifty Applesoft routines, called SNGFLT (single byte float?), 
documented by Crossley. In order to get SNGFLT to work properly it 
appears to be necessary for the accumulator to hold $00 before the 
subroutine is called. 

When an integer is "floated," its floating point equivalent is placed 
in an area of the zero page known as FAC (floating point accumulator). 
There are routines available to move the value in the FAC anywhere in 
memory as needed. At the moment we would like to have it wherever 
Applesoft would look to find VN, the variable used to hold the volume 
number. 

In part eight, lines 303 through 308, some "pseudo" (adjective- 
false; counterfeit; spurious, sham; pretended) Applesoft variables were 
created that look just as they would if they were in a program being ex- 
ecuted somewhere in RAM. In lines 155 through 158 the TEXT POINT- 
ER ($B8,$B9) is aimed at the one that looks like VN, and then we "fire" 
the Applesoft routine called PTRGET (pointer get). When the dust 
clears, the address of the value of the variable VN will be found in Y and 
the accumulator. Line 159 transfers the value in the accumulator to the X 
register, which completes the required setup for using the routine 
MOVEMF (move to memory from FAC) to put the FAC in the RAM 
locations pointed to by VN. 

All this merriment brings us to part four, lines 174 through 198, 
where the primary objective is to put an asterisk or a space in the LK$( ) 
array value indexed by the FC% variable. First, however, the locations 
$FC and $FD must be set to zero before they are needed in part seven to 
get the file name. This must be done for every entry; it must be done 
before part seven swings into action; and it is best done just once for each 
entry for efficiency's sake, so this is probably the best point at which to 
get it accomplished. The same logical process applies to lines 180 
through 184, in which the FC% variable is incremented by one. 

The remainder of part four and part five are virtually identical. A 
single character, which will be the entire string assigned to the LK$( ) 
(locked) or FT$( ) (file type) variable, is fetched into the accumulator 
and placed in the first byte of the input buffer. The X register is then 
loaded with a #$01 to denote the length of the string. The GDBUFS 
(good buffers?) routine is then called to clear the high bits of all the 
characters in the string (though it is only one in this case) and then place 
a #$00 at the end of it as an end-of-string marker. The text pointer is 
aimed at the pseudo variable to which we want this string assigned, and 
a DOSlink subroutine, MKSTR (make-it-a-string), which is discussed 
later, is called. Both of these parts end with a jump to COUT, which 



AUGUST 1984

picks up where the catalog left off. 

Part six, the process of getting the number of sectors used by each en- 
try into the array variable SE( ), was originally patterned after Wagner's 
"variable sender" routine, which he reported (and Crossley seemed to 
confirm) should work for all six types of variables. What prevents it 
from working, it turns out, is the eventuality of an array variable, 
like SE( ), being indexed with another variable, like FC%, resulting 
in the destruction of the FAC if the SNGFLT routine is used first. 
Fortunately, Crossley noted that PTRGET also stores its results in 
VARPNT,VARPNT + 1 ($83, $84), so the solution is to call PTRGET to 
find SEC(FC%), then float the sector integer using SNGFLT, then pick 
the now destroyed-in-the-registers pointers back up and use MOVEMF 
as before. 

The only really original programming in DOSlink is in part seven, 
where FI$ collects the file name. This routine is executed thirty times for 
each entry as it builds a file name and so is a little longer and more com- 
plex than the other sections. 

Each time catalog puts out a letter of the file name being displayed, 
the hook at $AE1C makes it detour to GETFNM at line 249. Here, the 
character being output is placed in the accumulator and the position of 
the letter in the file name, minus one, is placed in the X register. For ex- 
ample, if the program name being output was Hello, at the point when 
the "e" was being printed, the accumulator would hold an "e" and the 
X register would be set to 1 . The first thing done is to compare and see if 
what is in the accumulator is a space. If it is not, then the byte at $FC, 
called NONSPC, is updated by storing the current value of X in it. When 
the file name is completely processed, NONSPC holds the position of the 
last nonspace character, minus one. 

In either case, the next job is to put the character in the next con- 
secutive input buffer location. In this way the entry's name string is built 
one letter at a time in the input buffer. When the name is finished, the 
character counting byte, CHRCNT, is incremented and the same test that 
DOS does to see if cattdog is through printing the file name is performed. 
Most of the time the program will then continue with the catalog routine 
by exiting through NMLRTN (normal return). 

If the comparison of the Y register in lines 262 through 264 finds that 
the character just output is the last one that DOS will print, then X is 
loaded with the value of the last nonspace character, NONSPC in- 
cremented by one, and GDBUFS is used as it was before. We then point 
the text pointer at our pseudo FI$(FC%) variable and go to MKSTR 
before exiting through COUT. 

The pseudo- Applesoft variables in lines 303 through 308 of part eight 
have already been discussed. Part eight also contains DOSlink' s only "in- 
house" subroutine, MKSTR. Each routine that uses a string variable to 
hold its information sets the Applesoft text pointer and then calls on 
MKSTR. PTRGET is used to find the location in RAM of the string to be 
used. After careful setup, MAKS is called to move the information 
gathered from the input buffer to the next available free space in the top 
of memory. SAVD then matches the descriptors found by PTRGET to 
the new location of the string just relocated. 

The end is now in sight. Part nine is simple housekeeping to reinstate 
the proper Applesoft text pointer and then allow DOS to continue on with 
its exit. 

Presenting . . . DOSlink Demo. Listing 2, DOSlink Demo, which 
appears on page 58, is a unique (if trivial) revolving catalog that shows 
how to set up, use, and remove DOSlink. Lines 50 and 60 contain all that 
needs to be done to get DOSlink installed and ready to use. The arrays are 
dimensioned to 105 because that is the maximum number of catalog en- 
tries DOS wiU allow. Variables VN and FC% are set to zero only to docu- 
ment their use for the reader's future reference. 

The DOSlink version of the catalog command still prints the catalog 
while it copies the information into the arrays. In a lot of applications — 
custom catalogs, for instance— you won't want the normal catalog 
displayed before the- custom one. Line 80 of the demo shows how to 
disable video output without changing the screen display or preventing 
DOS from seeing its printed commands. It just pokes the address of an 
RTS command in ROM into the COUT vector in zero page, tiien tells 
DOS with a call 1002 to install that location as the effective address of 
COUT. It sounds complicated, but it is accomplished in three short com- 
mands. DOS does all the work. The DOS pr#0 command in line 90 
reestablishes normal video output. The credit for this technique goes to 
Softalk's assembly language columnist, Jock Root. 



By the way, line 60 turns off any eighty-column card that may be 
present. Because of all the vectors that the routine intercepts, DOSlink 
should only be used in forty-column mode. 

After the DOS catalog command is issued in the normal manner in 
line 90, the Applesoft variables will hold the data displayed, as previous- 
ly detailed. The variables will be changed each time a catalog is issued 
but will not be cleared. If a disk that has only five files is catalogued after 
cataloguing one that had ten files, FC% will be set to five but the 
variables FI$(6) through FI$(10) will still hold the data from the previous 
disk's catalog. You should see to it that your program doesn't 
misleadingly display these old file names. 

Lines 350 through 390 show how to remove DOSlink so that the only re- 
maining trace of the program is the disabled init function. The actual 
removal of the routine is done in line 390. The pokes and call cause DOS 
to once again rebuild its buffers so that a new program being run will 
find a standard DOS and a normal himem. IM

Why Blank "Cheat" 

Sheets? because They're 

Better Blank 

You've got the best com- 
puter in the world, and 
lots of software to run on 
it. One problem. Unless 
you work with these pro- 
grams everyday, it's hard J 
to keep all those com- 
mands straight. "F5" in 
one program means one 
thing, and "F5"Ln another program means 
something else. A few companies offer a die cut sheet that 
attaches to your keyboard with all the commands of one pro- 
gram printed on it. Great idea, unless you only need a few 
easy-to-find 'hints, " or you need them for lO or 20 programs. 
Our solution'' Simple. A pack of 12 lined cards, die cut to fit your 
keyboard and just waiting to be filled with those problem com- 
mands you forget most often. Simple? Yes, but effective. Now 
you con have all your program commands right of your 
finger tips on YOUR VERY OWN, custom designed "cheat" 
sheets. Great for offices and schools. Order a couple packs today!

You run a crane for the Fat City Wrecking Co. Your 
job: knock down deserted buildings in 10 cities. But 
beware! The old buildings are occupied by a bunch of 
nasty rats. And they're going to bombarci you with 
cans, tomatoes and rocks as you slam your wrecking 
ball into their crumbling homes. 

Can you batter the buildings before running 
out of fuel? Can you rub out the 
rampaging rodents? Fat City is 
a game everyone in your 
family is going to love. 
Says Softalk: 
great deal of 
thought went \ 
into its devel- 
opment as its 
excellent play- 
ability attests. The 
game incorporates 
super graphics and 
strategy, fun and a

Obsolescence is an ugly word, especially 
when applied to personal computers. How sad 
to think that the systems we spend so much 
time, frustration, and joy learning to use may 
soon be obsolete, outshined by a brighter star 
computer, saddened by a sexier sister machine, 
or marooned by a dearth of software. 

And then many people worry about the 
changes in operating systems. Apple has made 
quite a few, from thirteen-sector DOS 3.1, 3.2, 
and 3.2.1, to sixteen-sector (and incompatible, 
although there's a way to Muffin around that) 
DOS 3.3, to the newest Apple II operating sys- 
tem, ProDOS (for Professional Disk Operating 
System). But allay your fears; ProDOS will not 
make DOS 3.3 obsolete, and ProDOS does not 
exclude II Plus owners. If you have a 48K II 
Plus, that 16K memory card (called a Language 
Card by Apple and a RAM card by most other 
manufacturers) is the only addition you will 
have to make to your machine. Upgraded to 
64K, the n Plus will run much of the ProDOS 
software that does not require the 128K mem- 
ory or the special keys of the He and He. 

Embrace Change. DOS 3.3 is a great oper- 
ating system, and the DOS 3.3-based software 
is mountainous. One drawback of DOS is that it 
was not designed to be used with a hard disk. A 
hard disk is an information storage system simi- 
lar to floppy disks, except there is just one very 
large disk, and thousands of files are put on that 
one disk. Hard disks are quicker than floppies 
and, if you juggle large amounts of information, 
far more efficient. 

Most home users will find that floppies pro- 
vide all the storage they need, which is nice, 
since hard disks cost a lot more. Lots of busi- 
nesses, however, require hard disks. Unfortu- 
nately, only specially modified versions of DOS 
work with hard disks, and the modifications are 
incompatible with a lot of commercial software. 
So it's time for a change. ProDOS is helping the 
Apple n become a better serious computer. Em- 
brace change. Computer owners have been big 
beneficiaries of change. 

For a change, the He does not come with a 
DOS System Master. The lie does not come 
with DOS at all. If you have a DOS System Mas- 
ter lying around, you can use DOS with your lie 
and do exactiy what was described last month — 
you can use the init command to format a DOS 
3.3 disk, make a DOS 3.3 startup disk, and save 



Return to Apple, Embrace Change 

the program we wrote last time as the hello pro- 
gram. But instead of the System Master, you re- 
ceived a disk called System Utilities. System 
Utilities is to ProDOS what the System Master 
is to DOS 3.3. Both provide tools (utilities is the 
five-dollar way of saying tools) that make it 
easier for you to manage disks— to format them, 
for instance, or to copy them or parts of them. 

Last month we discussed DOS 3.3; if you 
had only the System Utilities, you were prob- 
ably a bit bored. This time we'll get back at the 
DOS 3.3 people by concentrating on ProDOS 
and by having ice cream. 

DOS 3.3 people don't have to be left out, 
however; you can run down to the nearest com- 
puter store and purchase the ProDOS User's 
Kit, and you'll have immediate membership in 
this month's colunm. Note that the command 
names and menus for the He ProDOS User 's Kit 
vary significantiy from those of the lie System 
Utilities. Apple figured that new lie owners 
would probably have less technical sophistica- 
tion than the old hands with lies and Pluses, so 
they made the He ProDOS utilities very friend- 
ly. While ProDOS User's Kit owners can fol- 
low this article and do everything the -He people 
can, the methods will be different. (Even if you 
don't have ProDOS and have no intention of 
getting ProDOS, you might skim down to this 
month's Basic program, just to keep your hand 
in.) We'll begin by making a backup copy of the 
System Utilities disk. 

Insert the System Utilities disk into the drive 
and close the latch. Turn on the monitor, and 
then turn on the computer. The System Utilities 
disk will automatically boot. What is happening 
during this time is that both ProDOS and a pro- 
gram called Basic. System are being loaded into 
memory. It's just like when you boot the DOS 
System Master, the first thing that happens is 
that DOS is loaded into memory. (The major dif- 
ference is that ProDOS and Basic. System are 
files on the Utilities disk, while DOS is hidden 
on disks initialized by DOS, and does not ap- 
pear in a catalog of the disk.) The next thing that 
happens after DOS is loaded is that the hello 
program is run. When you start the computer 
with ProDOS, the first thing that happens after 
the ProDOS and Basic. System programs are 
loaded is that the computer looks for and runs a 
program called Startup. 

On the Utilities disk, the Startup program 



presents a menu. When you boot System Utili- 
ties, the first thing you'll see (after the ProDOS 
and Apple lie copyright screens) is the Main 
Menu: It says so in the upper right comer. In 
the upper left it says "System Utilities version 
1.0," so you know what disk you're using. Most 
of the screen is taken up by a numbered list. 
This list is called a menu; like a restaurant 
menu, it informs you of your choices. This 
menu is divided into three parts, two of which 
have headings. The first part is titled "Work on 
Individual Files " and contains menu items one 
through four. The second part is titled "Work 
on Entire Disks" and contains menu items five 
through eight. The third part has no head and

contains only one menu item, number nine, 
"Exit System Utilities." Look down the menu 
to item number one, "Copy Files." Unlike the 
other items, this one is enclosed by parentheses 
and appears in upper-case letters. Type the 
number two and the second item is enclosed in 
parentheses and changes to upper case, while 
item one changes to lower case and loses its 
parentheses. When you press return, the empha- 
sized item is selected from System Utilities. 

In order to make a backup copy of System 
Utilities we need to select item five, "Duplicate 
a Disk," from the menu. Use the down arrow to 
choose item five, and then press return. 

The screen will now present you with the 
multiple-choice question: Where is your source 




TAI 1/ 



disk? The answer choices are given in another, 
shorter, menu, one made of only two items: the 
built-in drive, which is enclosed in parentheses 
and appears in upper case; and the external 
drive. The source disk is the disk you plan to 
copy. The destination disk is the disk you plan 
to copy it onto. Because in this case the source 
disk is the System Utilities disk, and it is al- 
ready located in the built-in drive (also known 
as drive 1), and because the built-in drive has 
been preselected, all you have to do is press 
return. 

The next screen asks. Where is the destina- 
tion disk? Actually, the destination disk is in 
your lap; what the question means is, where 
will the destination disk be when you are copy- 



AUGUST 1984 



ing the source disk? If you only have one disk 
drive you will choose the built-in drive item to 
answer this question, but if you have a second 
drive, use the down arrow to select the other op- 
tion. Press return when ready. 

You will be instructed to put the source disk 
in the built-in drive. If you were going to copy 
something other than System Utilities, you 
would now put it into the drive; but since you 
are copying System Utilities, which is already 
in the drive, just press return. After a short wait 
you will be told to put the destination disk in the 
drive. Do so and press return. 

You will have to name your new disk; this is 
a departure from DOS 3.3. In ProDOS, all 
disks have volume names (each disk is a vol- 
ume); you cannot call this disk System Utilities 
because you are not allowed that many charac- 
ters and because a space is not an acceptable 
character. ProDOS disk names must start with a 
slash; the default name, the one already in 
place, is /Utilities. This name is fine, since 
we're making a utilities disk, so just press re- 
turn. The disk will be formatted to ProDOS, 
which means that the information stored on it 
will be accessible under the ProDOS operating 
system, but not under DOS 3.3. Once it is for- 
matted, the words "Formatting . . . Done!" 
will appear on the screen. 

The computer will tell you to put the source 
disk back into the drive; do so and press return. 
You will have to swap the disks several times; 
the System Utilities disk contains many files, 
and copying the whole disk takes a while, so be 
patient. People with two disk drives don't have 
to swap disks, which makes the whole process 
faster and less tedious. 

When the destination disk contains all of the 
information on the System Utilities disk the 
screen will say "Duplicating . . . Done!" and 
will ask if you want to make another copy. You 
don't, so answer no and press return. Put a label 
on the destination disk so that you know it is 
now your /Utilities disk and put the original 
System Utilities away in a safe place. From now 
on you should use the copy as your Utilities disk 
and save the original in case a cup of coffee ac- 
cidentally tips over. 

Insert the new /Utilities disk in the drive. 
Look down the menu and find the choice that 
says "Identify and Catalog a Disk"; select it 
from the menu and press return. The computer 
will ask what drive the disk is in and then 
whether you want the catalog to be displayed or 
to be printed. Select display and you will get a 
catalog on the screen. 

The catalog arrangement of ProDOS is dif- 
ferent from that of DOS. The disk name is 
given, as well as the format, which is ProDOS. 
The asterisks in the left-hand column show 
whether or not a file is locked— an asterisk is 
present if it is. File names are listed in the next 
column, then the type of file, and then the size. 
There are quite a lot of files on the /Utilities 
disk, and many of the file names won't make 
sense. There are two files that we're particular- 
ly interested in right now. They are the ProDOS 
and Basic. System files— the heart and soul of 
/Utilities. They are the files that contain the 
ProDOS operating system and that let Basic pro- 
grammers use ProDOS commands, such as 
catalog, in their programs. 



rXHE DEBIT CREDIT CONNECTION"^ 

I A Personal and Small Business Accounting Software Program from SOLITAIRE^" | 

ARE YOU READY for an accounting software program that is written to make life easier for 
YOU (not the programmer), PRINTS CHECKS, SPLITS TRANSACTIONS, leaves lots of room for 
YOUR DESCRIPTIONS, posts AUTOMATIC TRANSACTIONS, is EASY to use and prints 
AUTOMATED REPORTS? Are you ready for an accounting program that lets you set GOALS for all 
accounts and GRAPHICALLY displays all balances? Are you ready for an accounting program that 
provides you with the POWER to manipulate and study your financial records from virtually any angle? 
Are you ready for an accounting program that IS COPYABLE, IS HARD DISK COMPATIBLE and 
incorporates many of the latest SPEED techniques on the market today? 

VOU HAVE FOUND IT!!! 

THE DEBIT CREDIT CONNECTION is a VERY FAST and EASY to use double entry accounting 
software program based on the process of transferring money from one account to another (probably the 
same system you already use). For example if you write a check for groceries you are taking the money 
out of your checking account and putting it into your food account. PRETTY SIMPLE RIGHT? Well 
that's exactly what this program is all about. See the words Debit and Credit in the title of this program. 
Look again because that's the only place you will see them. This program uses phrases like "TAKE 
MONEY OUT OF" and "PUT MONEY INTO" (remember the program is written for YOU not a 
CPA). PRINTS CHECKS? You bet, with name, address, city, state, zip and account number, even 
itemizes each entry. SPLITTING a transaction between several accounts is a breeze. The program will 
even type in most of the information for you. Every key pressed is checked for errors before it is accepted 
and all information is saved to the disk each time a program section is finished minimizing chances of data 
loss. Every transaction has 36 blanck spaces for the DESCRIPTION OF YOUR choice. In most cases 
that's enough room to satisfy the IRS's 6 W's (who, what, when, where, why and WHOW! much). Don't 
forget, this program may be tax deductible if used to keep tax information. Need a FINANCIAL 
REPORT? Select the report you want and THE DEBIT CREDIT CONNECTION accounting 
software program will AUTOMATICALLY do the rest. When you return the report will be waiting for 
you. A picture is worth a thousand words so HIGH RESOLUTION GRAPHICS of all balances is 
provided. The program will remember and automatically chart up to 38 accounts of your choice. That's 
not all, you can draw CUSTOM CHARTS just as easily. All this plus special HELP LINE hours for 
registered users from 5 to 7 pm weekdays. The thought and detail that went into this program cannot be 
described with words it must be EXPERIENCED. Send for your copy today.

To make a ProDOS startup disk with one of 
our own programs as the Startup program, we 
must first put the ProDOS and the Basic. System 
files on the disk. And to do this we must first 
have a formatted disk. 

Return to the main menu (by pressing es- 
cape) and select option six, "Format a Disk." 
Press return. Again, you have to name the disk. 
It's up to you, but pick a name that identifies the 
disk— /ProDOS. boot, for instance. The trusty 
lie will warn you to get your /Utilities disk out 
of the drive. If you initialize your /Utilities 
disk, you will replace everything on it with a 
hello program. You'll have a nice, useful blank 
disk, but no utilities. Insert a new disk and then 
press return. The disk drive will undergo a lot 
of commotion, casting spells on the new disk 
and such, and will finally tell you that the for- 
matting is . . . done! Remove the new disk and 
replace it with /Utilities. 

Menu item one, "Copy a File," is our next 
choice. Select this option. You'll be greeted by 
the familiar questions about where your disk is 
and so forth. You know what to do. When the 
computer prompts you for the name of the file, 
answer ProDOS. The file will be read from the 
/Utilities disk and then you will have to swap it 
with the destination disk— the newly formatted 
one. Continue swapping them until the copy is 
finished. 

Follow the same procedure to copy Ba- 
sic. System on the destination disk. When you 
are finished, leave the destination disk in the 
drive and return to the main menu. 

Oh, Captain! Another Wine List, Please. 
If you've been following along with a lie or n 
Plus, you've decided that you're in the wrong 
restaurant — none of the menus look like any- 
thing we've discussed. But you can still place 
your order. The utilities on the ProDOS User's 
Disk are split into two groups, Filer and Con- 
vert. Convert is the tool to use when converting 
DOS files into ProDOS files or vice versa. 
We'll concentrate on Filer for now. From the 
main menu, select item F. You'll see a new 
menu, and at the top of the list is a question 
mark. This is the Filer tutor. It helps explain 
Filer. Read through the tutor and return here 
when you're done. 

To format a new disk you have to select 
menu item V, "Volume Commands." When 
you do, you'll be presented with another menu. 
Choose item F, "Format a Volume," and re- 
move the User's Disk from the drive— you 
won't be reminded to do so. Put a new disk in 
the drive and press return. Like the System 
Utilities, the User's Disk requires you to name 
the disk, but instead of /Utilities the default will 
be /BlankOO. Call it what you like— August is 
catchy. 

When the disk is formatted, press escape un- 
til you are back to the Filer main menu; we want 
to put both Basic. System and ProDOS on the 
/August disk. Select item F for "File Com- 
mands" and then C for "Copy a File." You 
will be presented with a default source disk vol- 
ume name, /ProDOS. The volume name is the 
name of the disk and is followed by a slash and 
a file name. Change it to /ProDOS/ProDOS. 
The destination will be /August/ProDOS. Type 
return, and soon you'll be rewarded with the 
message "Copy Done." 



Readers with a IIc should now exit /Utilities 
by selecting menu item nine. The computer will 
ask if you really want to do this; typing n or no 
will stop the action; pressing return will com- 
plete it. He and II Plus ProDOS users can just 
press escape to get the main Filer menu and se- 
lect item Q for quit. Everybody should be out- 
side, in Applesoft. And happy to be here. Let's 
write a program. 

Last time we saved a useless addition pro- 
gram as a Startup program. Embracing change, 
this time we'll save the following useless pro- 
gram (II Plus and Ue users should type and run 
it, too, and perhaps save it to disk as greetings): 

10 HOME 

20 FOR I = 1 to 20 

30 PRINT TAB(I) 



40 PRINT "Hi! Can I help you?" 
50 NEXT I 
60 END 

Run it and you'll agree that it's a useless pro- 
gram. Let's see what it does, line by line. Line 
10 sends the cursor to the top of the screen. Line 
20 introduces us to a new programming tid- 
bit—the for-next loop. This is not complicated. 
With the word for we issued a variable (in this 
case the letter I, although we could have select- 
ed any letter) and assigned it twenty different 
values — one to (and including) twenty. The 
other half of a for-next loop is the command 
next; in this program the next occurs in line 50. 

In line 20 the variable I is assigned the num- 
ber one. In line 30 we ask the computer to print 
the tab. This may sound a bit strange; tab in Ba-

sic is like tab in a word processor or on a type- 
writer—it indents the text a specified amount. 
Although the tab doesn't appear the way a letter 
appears, the print command is still used to bring 
the tab into play. Because the amount of the tab 
is designated by the variable I, the first time tab 
is used it will tab over one space; the next time 
two spaces, and so on up to twenty. In line 40 
we print a banal message. 

Line 50 is the next in the for-next loop. 
When the program encounters a for it enters the 
loop, and it stays in the loop until it receives a 
next, at which time it will determine whether or 
not it must return to the for. In this program the 
next will return the program to line 20 twenty 
times. That is, the for line repeats until every 




WH TAI 1^ 



assignment for the variable has been used. 
Twenty Flavors, All of Them Vanilla. 

Confused? There's nothing like an illustration 
of for-next loops to really confuse people. Say 
that we all decided that, because it is August and 
because August is hot, we'll send one of our 
Cornermates, Augustus, out to get ice cream 
cones. There are twenty of us and, because Au- 
gustus is clumsy, he can only carry one cone at 
a time. The program for Augustus is 

10 leave home 

20 for a group that = 20 people 
30 go to store and get ice cream cone 
40 bring ice cream home 
50 next cone 

60 siddown and eat your ice cream 



AUGUST 1984 



Augustus leaves home and makes a mental 
note that there are twenty people in Beginners' 
Corner. He gets to the store and buys an ice 
cream cone— everybody's getting vanilla, as 
Augustus can't handle flavor choices— and 
brings it back home and gives it to a person in 
the Comer. And then Augustus is told to go get 
the next cone. Which he does, until everybody 
has an ice cream. On the twentieth trip back, he 
encounters the command to go get the next 
cone, but he notices that everybody has a cone. 
The one in his hand must be his. And because 
he can't carry more than one cone at a time he 
has no choice but to siddown and eat his ice 
cream. 

Our program works the same way. The tab 
is printed at stop one the first time through the 
loop and then prints the message, Hi! Can I help 
you?; the second time the tab is printed at stop 
two, and so on, until the message is printed at 
all twenty stops and there are no more, at which 
time the program sits down and eats ice cream. 

Run the program again with these insights in 
mind. If you don't like the message in line 40 
you can change it to something that you do like. 
Shorter messages look a little better on the 
screen. Remember, this message will print 
when this disk is booted, so think of something 
appropriate. Experiment with the other lines in 
the program. What happens when you rewrite 
line 20 to read for I = 1 to 20 step 51 

Okay, we're ready to put this program on 
the newly formatted disk as the Startup pro- 
gram. Pay strict attention! Last time, when we 
saved a hello program for a DOS disk, we said 
that you could name the program whatever you 
liked. This is not the case with ProDOS. The 
Startup program must be named Startup. List 
the program to make sure it's correct, and then 
type save startup. And that's it. 

Catalog the disk by typing either cat, for a 
forty-column display or (if your monitor can 
handle it) catalog, for an eighty-column 
display. (Incidentally, on the He, you can toggle 
between a forty-column catalog display and an 
eighty-column catalog display simply by press- 
ing escape 4 and escape 8. Try it.) 

The catalog you get when you type cat or 
catalog from Basic is slightly different from the 
catalog you get when you select "Identify and 
Catalog a Disk" from /Utilities. Let's look at a 
forty-column display of the /Utilities catalog. If 
a file is locked, an asterisk appears in the left- 
most column, next to the file name. Notice there 
are no spaces in the file names; where a space is 
called for, a period is used. The next column in- 
dicates what type of file it is. This disk has two 
types of files, Basic and system, recognizably 
abbreviated. The next column tells how much 
space (in blocks) the file occupies on the disk, 
and the next tells when the file was modified 
last— if you don't have a clock in your com- 
puter, and at this point you probably don't, 
there won't be any information under the 
modified column, just <no date> . That's okay. 

If ProDOS, Basic. System, and Startup are 
all present and accounted for, return to Basic 
and reboot the Startup disk by typing pr#6. 
After the copyright screen you should be greet- 
ed by your new startup program. Good work. 
See you next time.

"A BOLD 



INNOVATIVE . . . 
ORIGINAL HIT!" 




, r,... 




STAR LEAGUE™ BASEBALL 

Actual Atari® screens— Other versions may vary. 

"Rather than adapt and duplicate the same 
old ballgame, (Gamestar has) made some bold 
changes. This not only gives its contest 
heightened playability, but also reassures the 
public there are still more programmers with 
originality. 

"The first change is in player perspective. In 
Gamestar's rendition, we're all the way up in the 
right field bleachers, and wait until you see the 
action from here. With the pitcher now throwing 
right to left in 3-D fashion, we can watch the 
ball (and its shadow) dip and dance at the batter. 
When contact is made, the ball moves realis- 
tically, either bouncing through the infield or 
sailing with convincing flight toward the warning 
track. 

"The second innovation will become obvious 
after the ball is hit. The players automatically 
spring into action. You control their subsequent 
moves and throws, (which) forces the offense to 



rely on strategy and skill, rather than on an inex- 
perienced opponent scrambling to activate the 
correct fielder. 

"The game also incorporates other special 
features to insure a major league quality. You can 
choose from different line-ups, planning your 
game around the single hitters or the big boomers. 
There are different pitchers to start, with a 
reliever patiently waiting in the bullpen. A lively 
organist keeps the screaming fans happy while 
you play against an opponent or computer in a full 
nine-inning game or simple batting practice."

The word is out on 
word processors. 
Format-ir ranked number one. 



We've always thought of Format-II 
as the finest, easiest to use word 
processor for Apple® II + , He and 
Franklin® computers. We're pleased 
that Peelings n magazine agrees. 
They judged Format-II best out of 18 
leading word processors. Here's why: 
Format-II makes editing easy. 
There's our unique editing process: 
simple, mnemonic commands log- 
ically relate to the task you want to 
perform. To center text, you press 
[£]. To delete, E. lb justify E. 

And since what you see on 
the monitor is exactly what will 
print out, editing and formatting is 
always a breeze. 

The PeeUngs II reviewer said, 
"Format-II is one of the few word 
processors that is so comfortable 
and predictable, I would con- 
sider it as an addition to my small 
library of personal software. "

and performance to price ratio. 




In the words of the Peelings n 
reviewer: "ThisisthebestprogramI 
have seen for people who do a lot of 
work with mailing lists, form letters 
and short correspondence. " 
An easy to follow manual. 
Essential to any good program is a 
manual that's clear and under- 
standable. The Peelings n reviewer 
describes the Format II manual. 
"All in all, it is one of the best word 
processor manuals I have seen. 
The latest documentation is a 
model of clarity and organization. " 

Put it aU together. Then add 
features such as support of hard 
disk drives and a standard DOS 
text file format compatible with 
spellers and communications pro- 
grams, and it's not hard to see why 
Format-II has earned the number 
one rating. 

The words of the Peelings 11

*il!W^global sound stage. While the major movie companies are 
still based in Hollywood, the movies they make and sell can be 
shot almost anywhere. Back in the sixties, a "runaway produc- 
tiow'' was a film that wars shot in the Hollywood-like sound stages 
of Spain or Rome. These days, with several scenic states compet- 
ing fcxLjioHywood's production dollars, a movie has only to 
locat^or ten weeks of shooting in Rome, Georgia, to be called 
a runaway. 

In the golden studio days of Hollywood, grips, gaffers, best 
boysv and the like could spend the day in a sound stage re-creation 
of Waterloo and still make it home in time for dinner. Today, a 
Holiday Inn is often called home and all day is spent rearranging 
reality to suit the demands of a shooting schedule. While Holly- 
wood is making more movies than it has in years, making them 



Apples played a part in the making of several movies you 
might have already seen, including Reckless, Breakin', and The 
Pope of Greenwich Village. An Apple even trekked down to 
Mexico to work on Romancing the Stone. An Apple traveled to 
London and another is now in New York for Dream Lovers, a 
film currently in production. Another Apple is scheduled to go to 
Spain to work on For Whom the Bell Tolls. And then there are the 
many Apples that never leave the production office; they're in- 
house workhorses for indies and majors alike. 

Several independent software developers are responsible for 
the personal computerization of Hollywood. Two of those entre- 
preneurs are Emil Safir of Quantum Software and Jack Smith of 
DotZero. Both entered the "glam-tech" Hollywood market with 
a handful of specialty production packages that run on Apples, 




IK- 




as also become rrio 
Two years ago in the production offices of Hollywood, 
id, "A computer? What can that do?" But not anymore. Not 
since Hollywood's production people have found that Apples and 
other microcomputers can do a lot of the nuts-and-bolts stuff— 
ript breakdowns, budgets, word processing, accounting, pro- 
iction scheduling, talent booking, and television schedule run- 




M PCs, and CP/M systems. Smith's budget, script breakdown, 
and accounting software have been available for the Apple since 
mid-1982, and DotZero has many installations worldwide. 
Safir's script breakdown package for the Apple is just out of the 
test phase. 

Oddly enough, both Smith and Safir cracked Hollywood with 
strictly scientific credentials. Safir was a nuclear physicist before 
he produced a bank robbery film called Getting Even in 1977 and 
then studied at the American Film Instimte in Los Angeles. Smith 
is a former aeronautical engineer who had done laser research 
before he wound up doing production work on Raging Bull and 
The Howling. 

The two companies market similar budget, accounting, and 
breakdown packages to the same group of people, yet have man- 
aged to stay friendly rivals in a competitive— and sometimes 
nasty— vertical software market of maybe six thousand clients, 
total. "WordStar has a potential client base of millions," says 
Smith. The Hollywood software market can be measured in hun- 
dreds. That's why Smith and Safir both emphasize support after 
sales. Smith has even rigged up his software with "disaster re- 
covery" utilities so he can walk somebody through a program 
crash by phone if necessary, be the call from London or Manila. 



For the studio that once boasted of "more stars than there are in the 
heavens," the world is MGM/UA's sound stage these days. Wherever the 
lights, camera crews, actors, directors, and film editors can go, Apples can 
go— and they do. 



Hollywood impresses me as being ten million dollars ' worth of in- 
tricate and highly ingenious machinery functioning elaborately to 
put skin on baloney. 

—George Jean Nathan 

When the subject is Hollywood, most people like to hear 
about the problems that plagued a movie production or about tem- 
peramental stars. "Most people want to hear about how things 
started at twenty million and went up to sixty and how they shot 
for three years and fired three people every day," says Jonathon 
Zimbert, associate producer of MGM/UA's 2010. This is the 
good stuff— the gossip, the dirt, the Rona Report. 

No news is good news in the case of 2010. "We started when 
we were supposed to, finished when we were supposed to, spent 
what we were supposed to, and the movie's going to be out on 




time. Everyone's on schedule," says Zimbert. 

"If anything, 2010 shows that these types of movies— science 
fiction with a lot of hardware, a long production schedule, and 
high-priced people— can be done at a price where you can make 
money," he says. 

"It may be boring," he adds, "but from our standpoint it's ter- 
rific." On the lot of MGM/UA in Culver City, that kind of ter- 
rificness is often achieved with the help of Apples. 

As a result of Apple Computer's promotional involvement 
with 2010, MGM/UA 's advertising department latched onto a 
couple of lies for processing releases and Zimbert was able to use 
a Macintosh to help him check weekly cost runs from the 2010 of- 
fices in the Metro Building. Zimbert 's Mac came in handy plan- 
ning logistics for three days of location shooting, one in the na- 
tion's capital and two in New Mexico. Except for those brief 
trips, the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey was shot on sound 
stages for obvious reasons, says Zimbert. "It's expensive to go 
out in space." 

In the MGM/UA production building where accountants and 
estimators are housed, Apples abound, running DotZero's ac- 



Exterior footage shot on location is easily matched to interior footage later by 
ordering the right door. Jack Smith of DotZero (below left) worked his way up 

from coffee gopher to Hollywood software developer. DotZero software now 
makes Ken Weikel's job of production accountant easier— a three-hour job by 
hand like issuing checks only takes an hour by computer. 




counting package and helping keep production costs in line. 

There aren't a lot of professions where accounting is as high- 
profile as it is in Hollywood, the city of big deals. As Ken 
Weikel, an MGM/UA production accountant, says of his job, 
"It's more exciting paying money to people who are stars." 
When a film goes on location, the accountants and their Apples 
go right along, with mandatory disk and battery backup, of 
course. 

Weikel recently returned from a three-month shoot in Colum- 
bus, Ohio, for a film called Teac/ierj- starring Nick Nolte, 
JoBeth Williams, Judd Hirsch, and Ralph Nacchio— which is an 
irreverent look at the chaotic state of public education in a typical 
urban high school. Teachers was shot in and around— what 
else?— a typical urban high school in Columbus that recently 
closed. 

As one of the thirty production people brought in from Los 
Angeles and put up at a local Hyatt hotel, Weikel and his Apple 
worked out of a room on the third floor of the school. About thir- 
ty-five people on the film were hired locally. 

The shooting schedule continually changed for Teachers, an

unusual situation by Hollywood standards. Since the cast and 
crew had an entire school to themselves, they reasoned they could 
shoot when and where it was convenient. The decision resulted in 
added negotiations with a few agents. The fact that the company 
wasn't tied to a strict schedule allowed the unit to shoot a snow 
scene on a day it actually snowed. 

Some of Weikel's bookkeeping chores on the film included is- 
suing purchase orders for supplies, logging invoices for catering 
services and such, and paying the cast and crew their daily room- 
and-board allowances. A five-hundred-page sheaf of printouts 
(which Weikel calls his ''Teachers bible") holds the records of 
his vendors from A to Z and other transactions. 

While in Columbus, says Weikel, "Once a week I'd print 
out a weekly report so the studio would know the cost of 
everything." 

Teachers was "a ten-megabyte movie," says Weikel, refer- 
ring to the hard disk that holds all the files. Around thirty-five 
floppies were used to back up the information before the company 
wrapped in Columbus. "You can ship a hard disk back in a box, ' ' 
he says, "but I carry the floppies with me on the plane. " Back in 
Hollywood with the Apple, bills trickle into his office in the pro- 
duction building on the MGM/UA lot as Teachers wraps up in 
postproduction. 

Another film in postproduction also saw the use of an Apple. 
Garbo Talks, starring Anne Bancroft, Ron Silver, Catherine 
Hicks, and Carrie Fisher, is a comedy about a young New Yorker 
who is determined to fulfill his mother's impossible dream— to 
meet Greta Garbo. The studio is mum on who plays Garbo. 

Currently Weikel is in New York City working the books on 
an Apple for Dream Lovers, starring Kristy McNichols, which 
recently finished shooting some scenes in London. 

While working on Dream Lovers out of the studio's midtown 
production offices, Weikel will stay a few days in the MGM pent- 
house on the East Side, one of the occasional perks that being a 
movie accountant can bring. Maybe it'll make up for that seven- 
teen-below weather he had to put up with in Columbus, Ohio. 

Hollywood . . . the land of yes-men and acqui-yes girls. If all 
those sweet young things were laid end to end, I wouldn 't be at all 
surprised. 

—Dorothy Parker 

Despite its allure to passers-by, a location shoot is no picnic. 
Things can happen during the course of a movie shooting on loca- 
tion that would be called accidents anywhere else. To the produc- 
tion people in charge of sorting out a mess, it's more like, "What 
truck in what ditch?" The unexpected becomes routine. 

"It's not normal," says Donna Smith, production boss on Ar- 
nold Schwarzenegger's first bad-guy picture. Terminator. "All 
those beards, ball caps, and grubby sneakers make it look fun, but 
it's really tough." Smith and company recently spent two months 
on a night shoot for the futuristic feature, working twelve-hour 
evenings in downtown Los Angeles and screwing up their bio- 
logical clocks. 

A locationwise production auditor agrees with Smith. "It's no 
game and no party," he says. "It's mad and it's crazy and you're 
likely to come back twenty pounds heavier, ready for a nervous 
breakdown." 

Down the street in Culver City, Michael Murphy, a produc- 
tion executive at Republic Entertainment International, has a 
similar opinion on a grueling job that "all comes down to getting 
it in the camera." 

"It's like summer camp," says Murphy. "The work is in- 
tense, and when it's all over there's a letdown. Everybody goes 
on to another job." 

Without a studio behind them, most production people free- 



lance, hired on a per-film basis. They could be called celluloid 
gypsies. "You hit on a film and plug into the next," explains 
Murphy. "You're jazzed and ready to go. It becomes a driving 
need. Sort of a fix." 

It's definitely "not a gray job," as Smith puts it. Which is 
why, she says, there are "eighty to ninety people in line for every 
job on every shoot." 

On the set, the role of production manager requires tremen- 
dous logistical skills and a measure of personal diplomacy when 
dealing with often-tired, overworked people. In breaking down a 
script, more subtle gifts like insight, a feel for what the director 
wants, and the Hollywood equivalent of street smarts come into 
play. A scene may give only a brief clue as to the props, people, 
costumes, and effects needed. It's up to the production manager 
to pull them out. "Car swerves near cliff," for example, pro- 
vokes the question, "Do we need a stunt driver?" 

Reducing a script to its logistical requirements is the backbone 
of the production business. Usually done by, or under the super- 
vision of, the production manager, it's the equivalent of planning 
a paper assault in a war campaign. Script breakdown packages 
from DotZero and Quantum help computerize the chore. 

The shooting schedule of a movie is kept on something called 
a production board, which is actually a byzantine volume of 
seven to fourteen hard-back pages in an accordionlike binding. 
Each page of the "book" has color-coded paper strips attached to 
it for easy rearranging. Each strip contains vital information for 
each scene to be shot, such as when and what stars, props, and 
extras are needed; where the shoot takes place; whether it's day 
or night, and so on. 

Much of the preliminary paperwork that leads up to the fin- 
ished production board can now be done with the script break- 
down software. Lists of props, extras, effects, costumes, and so 
on required for each scene can be sorted in order of shooting se-

Most people would find it hard to believe the actual filming of a movie is 
coordinated with tiny strips of colored paper. Computerizing the production 
board is still fantasy, although Donna Smith promotes using an Apple on a 

shoot whenever she can. 



quence, interior or exterior scenes, and so on, ready to go to their 
respective departments for further delineation. These sorted lists, 
in turn, can be automatically massaged into a master document 
called a day-out-of-days, which charts the information posted on 
the production board. Copies of it go to cast and crew. 

As production supervisor on Reckless, Donna Smith took over 
twenty rooms in a Holiday Inn in the steel-mining town of Weir- 
ton, West Virginia, last year. "We descended on the hotel and 
cleared the rooms, put in phones, and brought in equipment and a 
catering truck," she says. Hollywood had arrived. "By the sec- 
ond day, we had gotten more than 900 calls from locals looking 
for jobs on the film." 

The first assistant director, Gary Daigler, did the Reckless 
breakdown from scratch in Weirton before actual shooting began. 
While the shoot was on, they used the Apple for memos and

"who's flying in on what plane" pickup lists. The battery backup 
protected Smith's machine from having the juice going down and 
from blackouts, one of which occurred Christmas week. Smith 
and Daigler were thrilled to be able to keep working in the dark 
until power was restored. 

Smith is a rarity in the film business, one of "four and a half 
women" holding down the traditional "man's job" of production 
manager. Her explanafion? "I can kick ass and get a crew to 
work and be harmonious about it just like everybody else," she 
says. Coincidentally, there's also a female producer and a female 
first assistant director on Terminator. 

With an Apple of her own for doing free-lance budget break- 
downs. Smith knows what one can do on the job. She carries a re- 
port she calls "Donna's Computer Presentation" when negotiat- 
ing a film as Persnickity Productions. A computer was nixed on 
Terminator, Smith explains, because the money went to enhance 
production values and will eventually show up on the screen. In 
this case, "probably a crash vehicle," she says, since Terminator 
is "a crash-and-burn, death-and-destruction kind of film." 

/ found the greatest sleeping pill in the world: this script. 

—William Holden 

Script breakdown and budgeting is an art form of necessity at 
a low-budget production company like Republic Entertainment. 
Formerly Sandy Howard Productions, it's the home oi Meteor, A 
Man Called Horse, and The Island Of Dr. Moreau. Republic is 
known for churning out mass-appeal genre films that work as 
well or better in foreign markets, due to the casting and cost- 
cutting savvy of Sandy Howard's staff. Not as flamboyant as 
"stormin' Roger Corman," Hollywood's best-known indepen- 
dent film-maker, the equally maverick Howard runs a tight ship, 
making as many films a year— six last year, twelve this year— as 
at many major studios, but without the overhead of one. 

"Physically, we're a small operation doing lots of pictures," 
says Joel Soisson. At Republic, Soisson and Michael Murphy do 
most of the preproduction work on a film before a crew and a pro- 
duction person are even hired. "We do it ourselves here because 
we know the rates, v/e have equipment deals, lab deals, and so 
on." If there's a Sandy Howard way of making movies, that's it. 

"When we saw more work ahead for this year," says Sois- 
son, "we knew hiring more people wouldn't work as well as get- 
ting a computer." Enter the Apple. 

Once a script comes down from the creative department on the 
second floor, a budget and breakdown are done, with help from 
the DotZero software. "This lets the powers that be determine if 
it's smart to go ahead on a picture," says Murphy. As they say in 
Hollywood, many are budgeted, few are made.

That's why we can emulate others, but others CAN'T emulate us. 

• The TIMEMASTER 1 1 will automatically emulate the correct clock card 
for the software you're using. You can also give the TIMEMASTER II a 
simple command to tell it which clock to emulate (but you'll like the 
Timemaster mode better). This is great for writing programs for those 
poor unfortunates that bought some other clock card. 

• Basic, Machine Code, CP/M and Pascal software on 2 disks! 

• Eight software controlled interrupts so you can execute two programs 
at the same time (many examples are included). 

• On-board timer lets you time any interval up to 48 days long down to 
the nearest millisecond. 

The TIMEMASTER M includes 2 disks with some really fantastic time oriented 
programs (over40) including appointment book so you' II never forget to do anything 
again. Enter your appointments up to a year in advance then forget them. Plus DOS 
dater so it will automatically add the date when disk files are created or modified. The 
disk is over a $200.00 value alone— we give the software others sell. All software 
packages for business, data base management and communications are made to

WUTAI V 



AUGUST 1984 



So far the Apple has been used on the preproduction break- 
down for three films: Killer's Holiday, a contemporary Bonnie 
and Clyde about two young men on a murder spree; For Whom 
the Bell Tolls, a lustier remake of the Hemingway classic to be 
shot in Spain or Malta; and Hero Run, a youth picture about a for- 
eign prison escape that may go top budget if casting goes as 
planned. The Apple also saw some action on KGB, a Bondish po- 
litical thriller with Sally Kellerman, which wrapped last June and 
is now in postproduction. 

For Whom the Bell Tolls has the most thoroughly developed 
schedule, thanks to the Apple. Detailed lists of every major prop, 
stunts, vehicles, cast, bit players, extras, guns, animals, makeup, 
and special effects have been done, as has the day-out-of-days. 
"The more information you take off a script," says Soisson, "the 
more you get back from the computer." 

"We're so together on this one that we could actually phone it 
in," jokes Murphy. "Before the computer, we wouldn't be able 
to have this kind of detail. Now, anything you can assign a num- 
ber to can be entered. All we have to do is ask, 'What days does 
the cannon work?' and all the days the cannon is needed appears 
on the screen." 

Last month, Sandy Howard was in Spain with printouts of the 
information, scouting locations for the Hemingway picture along 
with his production manager and negotiating to shoot Hero Run. 
Before he left, Howard got a small shock when he picked up the 
wrong Hero budget. Both the English and Spanish currency ver- 
sions are identical except for the dollar amounts. "The package 
has a built-in multiplier for figuring costs in foreign currency— in 
this case pesetas," explains Soisson. "Sandy couldn't believe his 
eyes when he saw he was spending $2,250,000 on one item" (in- 
stead of $15,000). 

"In the old days— one year ago," foreign budgets were "a 
nightmare," says Murphy. "It was all day on the calculator fig-

Joel Soisson (left) and Michael Murphy wrote the script for Hambone & 
Hillie, a family film that stars a recent Republic discovery— Lillian Gish. 

uring out exchange rates." It's so much easier now that when 
shooting starts on For Whom the Bell Tolls he's considering tak- 
ing a lie and a modem with him to Spain to handle the budget 
revisions. 

Of course, the bottom line on any Republic picture is cost. 
"The computer makes a lot of what-iffmg possible," says Sois- 
son, "allowing us to go in and change factors like actors, weeks, 
overall schedule, and— God forbid— union rates." Naturally, a 
nonunion picture is cheaper to make and easier to figure manually 
than an I.A.T.S.E. (International Alliance of Theater and Stage 
Employees) one. On the Apple, a flexible library of standard 
union rates for all jobs and all situations is built into film 
budgeting software. 

Ninety percent of the time, a picture can't be made with the 
first budget drawn up. "You know a picture can't be made if it 
costs too much," says Soisson. "A whole production is riding on 
what's printed out," which allows the Republic staff one elec- 
tronic thrill. "Everybody's waiting when you hit that last but- 
ton," says Soisson. "You're sweating, almost shaking." If the 
numbers aren't right, they have to go back in and try to find ways 
to cut. Without exception the first cuts are made in casting. 
Equipment is second. 

The most important thing in acting is honesty; once you learn to 
fake that— you 're in! 

—Samuel Goldwyn 

In the world of movie production, "a lot of people don't have 
an affinity for computers," says Jim Barr, a location-production 
accountant at MGM/UA. "You have to feel free to play with 
wires and jiggle cards." New to computing, most show people 
are wary of their Apples— a disk drive failure can terrify someone 
who's now dependent on them. 

On the other hand, some show people who've been doing 
"dog work" manually for twenty years or more have developed 
certain relationships with their computers, something akin to 
"sharing an aura." 

Nurturing that affinity— and the hand holding that goes with 
it— is the job of software developers such as Smith and Safir. 
They've both been in the production person's shoes and "know 
this crazy business intimately," says Smith. 

Smith likens the introduction of the computer to Hollywood in 
the eighties to the introduction of the electric motor in the twen- 
ties. "Nobody had to turn the crank on a camera anymore," he 
says. "Cameramen were free to frame a shot and be more 
creative." 

Hollywood is in good hands. 31

Remember Heywood Floyd? 

He was the first human being you saw in the film 2001: A 
Space Odyssey and the man responsible for sending those five 
guys to Jupiter with that loony computer. When the movie sequel 
2010 picks up the story nine years later, Floyd has been forced 
out of his government post and winds up in Hawaii with a com- 
fortable university position, his wife and kids, and a couple of 
playful dolphins that swim around in the living room. 

It's a good life, until the day a fateful call comes from the 
government. Now it's time to go out and rescue the derelict 
Discovery from that disastrous Jupiter mission and reactivate Hal, 
the paranoid schizophrenic computer. Now it's time to figure out 
once and for all just what the heck those big black monoliths are 
all about. Floyd has to strap on his calculator one more time and 
go out on one more mission. He has to answer the call to duty. 
Especially since it comes in over an Apple, the most personal 
computer. 

That's right. Theoretical physicist Heywood Floyd owns an 
Apple lie and a Macintosh— both of them, presumably, having 
given him a quarter-century of faithful, trouble-free service. 

Dawn of a Deal. 2010, starring Roy Scheider and John 
Lithgow, is scheduled to hit the theaters this December, sixteen 
years after Arthur C. Clarke wrote the original novel in 1968. 
Back then, Apple was the record label of the Beatles. Today, Ap- 
ples of the Cupertino kind will be on view in 2010, thanks to a 



new cinematic science called "product placement." 

The major use of recognizable company names and products 
was pioneered by 2001 (Pan Am, Howard Johnson's, AT&T, 
IBM) in its efforts to present a recognizable version of the near 
future. Since then, the practice has become a large and lucrative 
business. 

According to Bill Minot, director of merchandising at 
MGM/UA, "product placement is essentially looking at a script 
and finding a place in the script where the creative process calls 
for a particular product, and then going to a company that might 
be interested in having its product in that place in the movie." 

He points out that at MGM/UA, they don't throw just any- 
thing into a movie. A promotional tie-in with a product after a 



film is released helps them make the decision. The demographic 
profiles of Apple buyers and moviegoers matched up nicely in the 
case of 2010, Minot reports. 

"On 2010, when you think about the future and futuristic 
items that might be used by someone, it was obvious that home 
computers would be an integral part of the scene— especially port- 
able ones. That led [producer-director] Peter Hyams to say that 
he'd like to use one. It's not a major plot point, but it is the future. 
So I discussed the opportunities with several companies." 

Floyd's He and Mac are seen only in the beginning of the film, 
before 2010 takes off into the infinite starry regions of special ef- 
fects. As Debbie Kuhns, one of Apple's group marcom (market- 
ing conununications) managers says, "We'd already gotten an 



Apple on the real space shuttle, so we didn't need to get one on 
the Discovery.'" 

For the movie, "we wanted to have everything you see look 
as futuristic as possible," says Jonathon Zimbert, associate pro- 
ducer of 2010, "and we're also promotion-minded. Promotions 
are a way of advertising, if you will, getting hooked up with dif- 
ferent companies. So we went down the list, and Apple is far and 
away one of the wiimers in this computer derby. 

"Their Mac design is a neat design— although, granted, it's 
the 1980s. Chances are it's not going to be around in the year 
2010, but it looks interesting. With the Apple lie, they have a 
new thing coming out [tiie flat screen display] that they lent to us 
to use, and that also looks really neat.

Dr. Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider), leader of the American crew, confers with his fellow scientists on board the Leonov. 



"Apple is a big company," says Zimbert. "We knew they'd 
be around in a year; we knew they'd be around in 2010, so it was 
a nice company to get linked up with in that way. " 

Kaypros were the micros most directly involved in the film's 
production, forming a hookup between Hyams in Hollywood and 
Arthur C. Clarke in Sri Lanka for daily communication regarding 
script changes. The Kaypro, however, in Minot's opinion, is 
"not a highly mobile, personal, take-it-with-you computer." 
And "Apple seemed to be the one most interested in doing signifi- 
cant downstream promotion." 

At Apple Computer, sales promotional specialist Donna Weg- 
ner handles requests for movie tie-ins. She goes by a few general 
guidelines: "If it's the correct vehicle, one that has the proper 
image for Apple, we most definitely like to get visibility. We'll 
go with a movie that shows computers in a good light, that's 
upscale, not violent or laced with a lot of sexuality and that sort of 
thing. If it's a quality film that would give Apple good exposure 
for its products, we're most happy to get involved in product 
placement." 

The sequel to Stanley Kubrick's ultimate trip met Apple's re- 
quirements. Apple turned down product involvement in another 
MGM/UA film, Electric Dreams, the story of a computer that 
takes control of its owner's life. That micro is now being played 
by a Commodore. 

"There are product placement firms that come to you and 
want you to sign up for lots of dollars," Wegner says. "We don't 
use them." According to Wegner, there is no formal contract be- 
tween Apple and MGM/UA. "It's just been letters back and forth 
and a sort of verbal gentleman's agreement," she says. 

"One of the things you have to be concerned with if you make 
an arrangement with a film company," says Wegner, "is what 
happens if the scene ends up on the cutting room floor? We went 
down to Culver City and visited the set and the whole megillah. 
They had the producer come up here to Cupertino and give us a 
synopsis of the plot. They said, 'Now, we'll have to fill you in 
. . . ' but both Debbie and I had read the book. They said it was 
the first time they'd met with a company where the people did 
their homework. 



"We've established a nice rapport with MGM/UA. They're 
very easy to work with and we may do further films with them. " 

As far as the "downstream promotion" of the film goes, plans 
are still in development. "We'll be celebrating Apple's 2010 in- 
volvement in some significant fashion at the time of release," ex- 
plains Minot. "The specifics have not been worked out, but obvi- 
ously all those dealers who work with Apple will have the op- 
portunity to participate in a major holiday-type promotion of 
some sort." 

"We might have some kind of 'Win a Macintosh' contest," 
muses Zimbert. "Apple has a market and we have a market. We 
get people who go into movie theaters and they get people who go 
into Apple stores. Maybe we'll have some kind of 20i0-and- 
Macs display in every theater and Apple dealership: 'In the year 
2010, we'll still be here'— that kind of thing." 

While MGM/UA came to Apple with the idea of participating 
in the film, it's not uncommon for companies to approach studios 
with the same kind of idea. High-tech companies were aware that 
2010 was happening and could be the hottest ticket in town come 
December. "It's feast or famine," sighs Minot. "We were ap- 
proached by several people. 

"Some companies were not set up to have the major consumer 
impact we needed. We felt that Apple was the perfect candidate to 
participate in this, based on the nature of its product line and the 
creativity of the company. There's certainly a meeting of the 
minds and an enthusiasm around the project." 

And certainly a great chance for Leo the Lion to exchange a 
little product luster with a Snow White He. 

"I think it's gonna be hot, to tell you the truth," confides 
Wegner. "I've seen some of the stills with the Macintosh and the 
nc with the flat screen— it's our prototype; it's not even in pro- 
duction yet. But this is 2010, so ... " 

But finally, really, why did MGM/UA choose an Apple, over 
all the competition, to represent some of the breathtaking hard- 
ware of the twenty-first century? 

"I don't know," muses Wegner. "Probably because it's the 
best."

PRODUCTS FOR THE APPLE COMPUTER 



quikLoader^ 




SPEED 

The quikLoader is the fastest way to load programs. BAR NONE! Applesoft, 
Integer, or machine language programs can be loaded in fractions of a second. 
More importantly, DOS is instantly loaded every time the computer is turned on. 
Integer is even loaded in the language card. This process takes less than a 
second, saving valuable time. 



CONVENIENCE 

How many times have you started to work with afrequently used program, only 
to find that you have misplaced the disk, or worse, had the disk damaged, or the 
dreaded "I/O ERROR" message flash on the screen. With the quikLoader, these 
nightmares can be a thing of the past. Frequently used programs are available 
instantly when you need them, without having to look for the disk, or hoping that 
the lengthy disk loading procedure goes smoothly. 



PROGRAMMING EPROMS 

Putting your own programs on the quikLoader is easily done, using a separate 
EPROM programmer, and the instructions that we supply. For APPLESOFT, 
INTEGER, or single machine language files, you simply take an "image" of the 
program, and put it into the working array of the programmer. Add a few bytes for 
the overhead and catalog, and instruct the programmer to "burn" the EPROM. 
Plug it into the quikLoader, and your program is now Instantly available to be 
cataloged, loaded, or run. No programming knowledge or experience is 
necessary to do this. You will need experience if you want to save copy-protected 
or complex programs. The amount of experience necessary depends on the 
complexity of the program 



COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS 

If you have a program that is valuable, it will become more valuable when it is 
instantly available to you. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RESEARCH GROUP is 
actively seeking licenses from software publishers to allow their popular 
programs to be made available for the quikLoader. Independent authors are 
encouraged to write programs suitable for the quikLoader. If the author wishes, 
we will market the program (with appropiate royalties), or the author can take care 
of all marketing. In either case, we will make known to our customers the 
availability of these programs. 

We start your library of programs with the most popular utilities on the card, FID 
and COPYA. Now, if you have to copy a disk, you don't have to search for the 
master disk. You can start copying within 3 seconds after turning on the 
computer. 

We are currently licensed to sell two very popular programs on PROM. 
DOUBLE— TAKE by BEAGLE BROS., and COPY ][ PLUS by CENTRAL POINT 
SOFTWARE. The introductory price for DOUBLE— TAKE is $45.00. This includes 
the program exactly the same as you would buy it at your dealer for $34.95 
(includmg disk and documentation), and a programmed 27128 EPROM (worth 
about $25.00). COPY )[ PLUS cost $65.00 This includes the original program 
(worth $39.95) and two programmed 27128's. More commercial programs are 
now in the works. 



MEMORY CAPACITY 

The quikLoader has eight sockets for EPROMS. These sockets can 
accommodate the standard 27XX series of EPROMS. Types supported are the 
2716, 2732, 2764, 27128, 27256, and 27512. These types can be freely intermixed. 
The memory capacity of the quikLoader depends on the EPROMS used. For 
example, the 2716 can hold 2K of programs, and the 2751 2 can hold 64K. (Frankly, 
the current costs of the 27512 is prohibitive, but should come down drastically in 
the next year.) At this writing, the least cost-per-bit is provided by the 2764, which 
can hold an8K program. Using these "chips", the quikLoader bcomes a 64K ROM. 
Using larger capcity EPROMS allows it to become a 128K, 256K, or even a512K 
card. If more memory capacity is needed, the quikLoader operating system 
supports multiple quikLoaders. 

INCREASED DISK CAPACITY 
Since DOS is loaded from thequikLoaderevery time the computer is turned on, 
it is not necessary to take up valuable disk space with DOS. This will give you 
more than 5% additional space for programs and data on your disks. 

ADDITIONAL FEATURES 
The quikLoader has some other handy features. The following keys, pressed in 
conjuction with "RESET" will perform these actions: 
Z — "Cold boot" 
H — Run "HELLO" program 
D — Boot disk 
X — Enter Mini-assembler 
B — Boot only 
C — Catalog disk 

Q — Display catalog of programs on quikLoader 
M — Drop into monitor. 
To run a program from the quikLoader, bring up the quikLoader catalog (Q- 
reset), and the names of the programs will be displayed, along with an index letter. 
Pressing the index letter will instantly load and run the program. If you wish to 
load the program without running it, this option is available to you. 

While the quikLoader catalog is being displayed, pressing the "Z" key will 
toggle the parameter display, showing PROM address, RAM destination address, 
and length. 

Up to 23 programs on the quikLoader can be displayed on the screen at one 
time. If you have more programs, you may scroll through the catalog (either 
direction) for up to 256 programs. 

The quikLoader is ideal for applications requiring a dedicated computer. Your 
program can be automatically loaded and run at "power-up". 

ABOUT THE DESIGNER 

The quikLoader was designed by Jim Sather, author of UNDERSTANDING 
THE APPLE ] [ (forward by Steve Wozniak), published by QUALITY SOFTWARE 
(21601 Marilla Street, Chatsworth, CA 91311 (818) 709-1721). 

REQUIREMENTS 

The quikLoader plugs into any slot of the APPLE ] [+ or //e. If used in a ] [+, a 
slightly modified 16K memory card is required in slot O. A disk drive is required to 
save data.

Unless otherwise noted, software can be assumed to run on any Apple II with 48K 
and one disk drive. Programs that meet these minimum requirements will usually 
run on the Apple III.

PIHAIKIAL COOKBOOK. By Stan Trost. When it comes to computer- 
aided household finance, programs typically help in showing how money 
is spent. They provide a recap of the previous month's activities, saying, 
in essence, "Good work; you saved 15 percent on groceries," or, "You 
really didn't need -to purchase that second solar-powered beer 
dispenser." You provide the numbers, and the program helps figure out 
where the money's going. 

Financial Cookbook is quite the opposite of those programs. Instead 
of showing you what you've done right or wrong, it helps determine 
what financial actions to take that will result in maximum profits or mini- 
mal losses. And the program is surprisingly easy to use; the escape, ar- 
row, and return keys (and number keys, of course) are the only ones 



used. Those who have an AppleMouse can use it instead of the arrow and 
return keys. 

Included are thirty-two financial "recipes" that analyze savings ac- 
counts, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), mortgage schedules, car 
payments (buying, leasing, fixing), interest rates, treasury bills, and 
long-term investments. Each recipe asks for information such as the in- 
flation rate, interest rate, amount of payment or deposit, number of years 
to analyze, and marginal tax rate. 

Marginal tax rate, a term introduced by Financial Cookbook, refers 
to the percentage of income that goes to federal and state taxes. Since 
taxes significantly affect the results of investments, the program takes 
taxes into account when performing calculations. Most of the recipes ask 
for your marginal tax rate, and the first recipe figures it out for you. 
However, before it does so, you do need to provide the program with 
personal tax information, so it's a good idea to have the previous year's 
federal and state tax returns handy, as well as a tax rate table. 

When you select a recipe, the program asks you to supply numerical 
information (dollar amounts, interest rates, compounding periods). After 
that, selecting the "compute" option from the menu starts the wheels

turning; results appear on the screen one line at a time. In the case of a 
multiyear analysis, results scroll off the top of the screen, but it's possi- 
ble to review them when the calculating is done. Naturally, results can be 
printed for future reference, and you can save filled-in recipes onto a 
data disk. 

Financial Cookbook assumes that most decisions you make will result 
in additional income, so sometimes it's more realistic if you provide tax 
rates that would apply if you were in a higher tax bracket. 

Inflation is also taJcen into account, but since the long-range rates are 
unpredictable, this variable is most useful for short-range forecasts. 

The program's strongest point is that it lets you change variables and 
see the results immediately. What will happen if you deposit $1,000 per 
year into an IRA? How about $1,500? It's like having the power of a 
spreadsheet, except you don't have to create the formulas for 
calculation— they're already built in. 

For the curious, a technical appendix shows the formulas used in each 
recipe, and a glossary defines more than 150 terms used in the program 
and manual. 

No computer program completely takes into account real-life 
variables, so Financial Cookbook should be used with caution. Each rec- 
ipe assumes that the numbers you're inputting will remain constant for 
the length of time you want to analyze. Almost without a doubt, inflation 
and interest rates will fluctuate and yearly income will change. You may 
even receive an inheritance or win a sweepstakes. All these changes will 
have an impact on financial decisions. 

The program is meant to provoke thought about money matters; it's 
not intended to be used as a financial advisor. At best, it will cause you to 
think about what to do with your money. Miy

PAPER CliAPHKS. By Robert Rennard. There are many programs on the 
market that can print the images on the hi-res screen to a graphics-cap- 
able printer, but not many can compare to Paper Graphics. Sure, there 
are many printer interface cards that have this dumping capability, but 
none have as much versatility or as many options as this utility. 

Virmally every printing option you would ever want or need is avail- 
able here, and using the utilities requires little more than picking from a 
menu. Pictures can be printed in normal (white on the screen is black on 
paper) or inverse (the opposite) modes, centered on the paper, at left or 
right margins, or oriented manually by entering its offset from either 
margin in inches. Also, a single command prints hi-res screens one and 
two, with page one printed directly above page two. 

Prior to being printed, the picture can be manipulated to produce 
some interesting results. The right and left or the top and bottom ends of 
the image can be swapped to produce the screen's mirror image, or the 
screen can be flipped upside down without the mirror imaging. The pic- 
ture can also be transferred to the other hi-res screen, which may pro- 
duce eye-opening "panoramic" effects. Trial and error is the only way 
to learn how to use this feature. Namrally, once the screen is altered, it 
can be dumped to the printer. 

Images can be printed right side up or sideways, which is almost stan- 
dard for many graphics dump programs. Paper Graphics also lets you 
select any portion of the screen and print only that portion. Care must be 
taken when using this option, because cropping the screen image affects 
both hi-res screens when they both are to be printed. 

It's also possible to magnify pictures up to nine times the smallest size 
(one pixel is approximately equal to one printed dot). The image may be 
stretched vertically or horizontally by different magnification factors, 
enlarging a small portion of the image into a full-page picture. However, 
such a magnification can leave the picture looking as if it were drawn in 
lo-res graphics. 

The most impressive feature of Paper Graphics is its varied print 
densities (how closely the dots are printed together). Setting the program 
to print in high density creates output that is extremely dark and crisp, 
eliminating the white shadows typical of many graphics dumps. Even 
when an image is printed with a heavily used ribbon, the result is surpris- 
ingly dark and clear. Printing density can be altered vertically and hori- 
zontally to achieve the desired printing darkness. 

Also included in the package is Graphics Composer, a utility that al- 
lows you to frame a picture in any of the eight hi-res colors, add hi-res 
text to any portion of the screen, and crop off the edges of the screen. A 



picture packer is included; it compacts the hi-res screen to save disk 
space (a la The Complete Graphics System). 

Because Paper Graphics is unprotected, its routines and features can 
be used from within other programs; the manual clearly explains how to 
do so. The package is compatible with virtiially every printer, dot-matrix 
or letter quality, and brings graphics dumps to many printers that 
couldn't produce them before. (Penguin dares you to find a printer it 
doesn't support.) Paper Graphics has all the right features at a reason- 
able price. Penguin Software's concern for its customers really shines 
through in this package. (H

BAKOH. By Jim Zuber. Blue Chip Software might like us to think of 
Baron as a real estate speculator's training ground, and to some extent 
this is justified. But Baron is mostly an exploitation of our boundless 
fascination with incredible sums of money. 

In Baron, you're given $35,000 and sixty months to turn it into $1 
million by buying and selling real estate and making related investments. 
No home improvement; no putting hotels on Boardwalk. Beginning as a 
novice, your status and credit rating improve as your worth increases, 
until, as a millionaire, you reach baron status. 

Baron begins by presenting a graph of the overall real estate market, 
showing whether prices in general are going up or down. Following this 
is a graph of the status of the real estate market in one of the five states 
(New York, Florida, Texas, Kansas, and California) in the game. Head- 
lines from the fictitious but no doubt prestigious Financial Journal 
follow. Some are helpful to speculators, while others are simply cryptic 
bits of . . . humor? 

Property owners then see graphs relating to their land. For instance, 
if you have property in Miami, you'll see the graph for Florida land. The 
final screen shows prices for all three types of real estate (land, residen- 
tial, and business) in all five states. 

Now it's time to play. Menu options include looking at available prop- 
erty, buying property or the option to buy it, prospecting alternative in- 
vestments, and borrowing money. 

At the end of the sixty months, if you haven't amassed $1 million, 
you don't win. But your account doesn't necessarily revert to $35,000, 
either; you can start a new game with whatever amount you finished the 
previous game. You can also save games at any time, allowing you to 
play one out and return to the saved game, making other decisions and 
seeing how one path compares to another. 

Interpreting the Financial Journals headlines can be frustrating. 
Consider the following: "MCA Inc to Buy Land in Florida for Possible 
Theme Park." If MCA is planning to buy up land in Florida, it is prob- 
ably too late to get in on the profits to be made from Florida land owner- 
ship. If you own land in Florida already you might hold off a month or 
two before selling what you have, but if you own a vacant lot in Palm 
Beach and the theme park is going up in Tampa, it's hard to see how 
you'll be affected. 

However, in Baron land prices tend to go up in groups. If you have 
land in the northern and southern parts of the state, both parcels will in- 
crease at the same rate, which doesn't seem very realistic. If that theme 
park goes up, it may indeed affect your across-the-state holdings. 

The program would benefit from a good proofreading. While 
typographical errors are acceptable in the blurbs that describe properties, 
they're inexcusable in messages from the program. 

Quick execution is not Baron's forte. With each turn come several 
graphs— three for each of the five states and one showing the mortgage 
rates. However, it takes so long to call up each graph that players may 
find themselves moving from month to month and ignoring a lot of the 
information. 

As for realism, the one thing you can count on is that no one is mak- 
ing any more land. What is there is all there is; as the population and the 
demand for housing grow, land values must rise. Those with patience 
will likely turn a profit. 

Baron's few departures from reality may annoy those who are used to 
the true real estate market. Its sluggishness and typographical errors 
aside, the game offers entertainment in the form of a simplisfic overview 
of real estate speculation. IZ

HARD-DISK 

5 Megabyte Removable 
DIGITAL ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS, INC. 



SYSTEMS 



The Digital Electronic Systems 
HARD_DISKs will operate with a mixture 
ofDOS 3.3, CPM 2.20, and PASCAL 1.1 on 
the same or any of 12 drives on one Apple up 
to a maximum of 1.8 billion bytes. 

Once the disks are set up they are 
addressed and used in the same manner as 
floppy disk drives, but with much greater 
storage capacity and speed. 

This means the use of a HARD_DISK is 
transparent and was designed to work with 
any user application program without 
modification. 

You can boot between operating systems 
quickly without turning off the Apple. 

DOS does not require any user memory. 
The first 3 1 megabytes of CPM anywhere in 
the system does not require any user 
memory. Each volume of Pascal up to 16 
megabytes requires only 10 bytes of user 
memory. 



FEATURES 

• User-selected volume sizes as follows: 

DOS to 400K. 

CPM to 150 megabytes. 

PASCAL to 16 megabytes. 

• Up to 254 DOS volumes, 63 CPM 
volumes, and 64 PASCAL volumes per 
drive. 

• Compatible with system accesses to the 
disk under all operating systems (DOS 
RWTS, CPM R/W random/ sequential, 
PASCAL unitread/unitwrite, etc.) 

• Complete information on directly acces- 
sing the HARD_DISK including direct 
access using your own drivers. 

• Transparent operation using each operat- 
ing system's present commands. 

• Backup three ways: 

1. HARD-DISK to removable 
HARD_DISK. 

2. HARD_DISK to floppy (backup/ 
restore). 

3. Cartridge tape drive (available from 
DES). 

• Split/ merge files between HARD_DISK 
and floppies. 

• Boot into any operating system and 
between operating systems. 

• VOLUMES program displays drive 
contents. 

• User-selectable format interleave for 
maximizing performance. 

• HARD_DISK can be used in any slot 
(except 0). 

• Floppy-like size, 3'/2" height, S'A" width, 
and 12" in length. 

• Six month warranty. 



DOS 

DOS is run on the HARD_DISK by 
using multiple DOS volumes on one 
physical drive. The volumes are numbered 
consecutively (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ... n). 

The maximum DOS volume size is 50 
tracks (400K) because DOS will only handle 
a maximum of 50 tracks. This allows up to 
101,600K bytes (over 100 megabytes) of 
DOS on each HARD_DISK drive. 

Up to 8 drives may be configured with up 
to 254 DOS volumes per drive on a single 
Apple system without using even one byte of 
user memory. That is a total of 812 
megabytes or the equivalent of 5,800 floppy 
diskettes. 

DOS HARD_DISK volumes can contain 
up to 217 files. 

DOS turnkey system can boot any volume 
number. 

Name of "HELLO" program is user- 
selectable and can be changed at any time. 

H ARD_DISKs are compatible with most 
fast DOS systems (e.g. DIVERSADOS). 

CPM 

Maximum speed and efficiency achieved 
by user-selected directory size and data 
block size. 

Data block size can range from 1K-16K. 
Compatible with CPM functions such as 
random and sequential read/ write. Quickly 
change between volume configurations 
using transient command. Up to 6 volumes 
on line at one time (A:-F:). 

PASCAL 

Pascal can handle up to 16 megabytes per 
volume and up to 77 files per volume. Pascal 
has the ability to quickly change volumes on 
line. Can use HARD_DISK to edit, 
compile, assemble, etc. up to 6 volumes on 
line at one time. Can attach additional 
volumes to user unit numbers 128-143 and 
access using unitread and unitwrite. 



HARD-DISK PACtm 
CHARACTERISTICS 

The recording media consists of a 100mm 
"thin film" metallic alloy platter. A glass-like 
carbon overcoat protects the magnetic 
substrate making the disk impervious to 
contaminants such as dust and smoke, as 
well as protecting against head crashes that 
could result from sharp movements of the 
drive. The carbon overcoat also eliminates 
the need for extended purge cycles and 
increases PAC durability.

LEARHinC WITH FUZZrWOMP. By Mike McKee and Martin Shen. This 
program for preschool children is reminiscent of and a follow-up to the 
company's successful Learning with Leeper. The player uses a joystick 
to maneuver Fuzzywomp, a cute, furry, caterpillarlike being, about the 
screen to choose and play four learning games intended to strengthen ba- 
sic skills such as coordination and number concepts. 

In Domino Match, a mainframe computer picks out a domino with a 
specific number of spots on it, and the child must find an identical 
domino among eight others shown. If the player chooses incorrectly, 
Fuzzywomp will point out the correct one. 

In Juggling Clown, a clown figure displays a numeral from one to 
ten; the task is to release the equivalent number of gumballs from a gum- 
ball machine and onto a ramp. Releasing the correct number causes the 
clown to juggle the gumballs. Let out an incorrect number, and the gum- 
balls drop off the ramp one by one and are counted as they drop, 
demonstrating the disparity in digits. 

In Bubble Up, Fuzzy, armed with a blow dryer, faces a cauldron 
from which numbered bubbles (again, one to ten) escape. You use a joy- 
stick button to shoot them in their proper numerical sequence; the nu- 
meral needed at any given time is displayed on the side of the screen. In- 
correct choices get popped; correct ones join their fellows and Fuzzy in 
a short jig. The pacifist sentiment evident in the choice of a hair dryer 
rather than a piece of state-of-the-art weaponry is admirable. 

In Make-a-Monster, the fourth and most gamelike of the options, 
children assemble a creepy critter from an inventory of heads, feet, and 
torsos. The monster then comes alive and acquires a blow dryer, which 
is turned toward Fuzzy, who doesn't blow away but instead merely trans- 
forms himself— from fish to sun to ball to elongated worm— in reaction 
to each of four air blasts. 

In the last option, the program returns automatically to the menu after 
one play. In the other three, pressing escape takes the child to a higher 
level, and pressing it again leads back to the menu. This was omitted 
from the instructions. 

All in all, this is an enjoyable but unremarkable piece of software. IP

POPCOM A-IOO. In the modem market, one of the most prominent 
names is Hayes Microcomputer Products. Hayes was one of the first 
companies to bring telecommunications to the home computer and has 
enjoyed huge success there, as well as in the business market. Because of 
this, virtually all communications programs are written to work with 
Hayes modems, if no others. So it seems reasonable that if you want peo- 
ple to buy your modem, you'd better make it work like a Hayes modem. 
The X-100 works like a Hayes, and it does so with fewer hassles, but 
also with fewer conveniences. 

There are two ways to set up the X-100: the convenient, expensive 
way and the awkward, inexpensive way. The X-1(X) plugs directly into a 
wall socket, eliminating the need for the transformer that usually runs 
from wall socket to modem. You can hang the X-100 on the wall, plugged 
into the power socket, but that means you'll have to get an extra-long 
RS-232-C cable to connect it to a serial card in the Apple (neither the ser- 
ial card nor the RS-232-C cable is included), and those cables can be 
quite expensive. 

Prentice, the manufactarer of the X-100, says that the ability to plug 
the modem directly into the wall is a feature, but in such a setup there's 
still an RS-232-C cable running from the modem to the computer. Also, 
some wall sockets are next to the floor, making it impossible to plug in 
the modem. The inexpensive option is to have the modem next to the 
computer, which requires running an extension cord from the modem to 
the wall socket. 

Having the modem near the computer is more convenient, defeating 
the purpose of the modem's plug-in feature. The only problem is that it 
doesn't have any rubber "feet" with which to grip a desk top, and the 
case is made of a plastic that allows the modem to slide around unless 
there's a heavy object on top of it. 

After everything is plugged in correctly, the modem is all set to run. 
Prentice compares this ready-set feamre to the steps necessary to put a 
Hayes 1200 modem into operation, which require you to open the case of 
the modem and set eight internal switches— a procedure that might take a 



few minutes at most. However, there are other modems (for example, 
the Apple 1200 and Microcom Era 2) that also don't require any internal 
switches to be set. And if you're using the X-100 with the Apple Super 
Serial Card, there are still fourteen switches on the card to take care of. 

In operation, the X-100 functions and accepts commands almost iden- 
tically to the Hayes 1200 (or Apple, or Microcom) mcxlem. One signifi- 
cant difference is that the X-100 lets you plug a telephone into it, elimi- 
nating the need for a Y adapter if you have a modem and phone plugged 
into the same line. However, when plugged into an extension line (in an 
office setting, for example), the modem doesn't detect incoming calls, 
nor does the telephone ring. In such a setting, the modem must be dis- 
connected from the phone line in order to receive calls. 

The X-100 can detect when a phone on the same line has been lifted 
off the hook. At this point, the X-100 shuts off its carrier signal, letting 
you use the phone in a voice mode. The flip side to this feature is that if 
someone else inadvertently picks up the phone extension in another 
room, you also lose the carrier (a "Do not disturb" card is included, but 
who's really going to place the card on another phone every time they 
use the modem?). 

Another safety measure is that the X-100 turns on its internal speaker 
and holds the line for seven seconds when the data connection is lost 
from the other end. This way, you can hear whether someone on the 
other end is trying to talk to you. However, it also means that there's a 
seven-second delay between the time you end the connection and the time 
you can issue any commands to the modem, such as dialing another 
number. 

A feature the X-100 does have over its competitors is a knob that con- 
trols the volume of its speaker. Of course, the modem does accept com- 
mands to turn the speaker off completely; but if you want it on and don't 
want to disturb the rest of the household, the volume-control knob is a 
godsend that lets you keep the noise at a tolerable level. 

Notable is the X-lOO's manual, which is incredibly easy to under- 
stand. Diagrams show where things plug in, leaving little room for error; 
commands, responses, and error messages are explained thoroughly.

The^advantages of having the X-100 instead of the Hayes 1200 are 
apparent during the first few minutes of installation and even before, 
when you're paying the cashier (the X-100 is much less expensive). 
After that, the main difference between the X-100 and other modems is 
in desk-top logistics (the Hayes and Apple modems fit under a telephone; 
Microcom's fits completely inside the computer), where the X-lOO falls 
a bit short. mi

DISK ARRAIICER. By William Swanson. As the disk is booted, the famil- 
iar William Tell Overture, which conjures up nostalgic images of the 
Lone Ranger, trumpets from the Apple's speaker. Who was that masked 
penguin? Those graphics wizards must be at it again. But this program 
has nothing to do with graphics. The title is self-explanatory; Disk ar- 
Ranger is a tool to help you arrange disk files into any desired order on 
the catalog. 

Disk arRanger is a collection of utilities that allow you to generate 
customized disk directories by rearranging the order of file names. It will 
do just about everything short of creating the files themselves, and the 
commands are easy to remember and use (S sorts, D deletes, L locks). 

When the catalog of a disk is read into memory, it's displayed on the 
screen. Files marked with the letter D are files that have been deleted, 
and H reveals the greeting, or hello, program. Locked files are designat- 
ed by asterisks. 

Moving a file name is as easy as cutting and pasting. Cutting is done 
by placing a horizontal bar cursor over the file name; to paste, just use 
the arrow keys to decide where to place the file name and press the return 
key. Simplicity at its best. To sort the directory, you can alphabetize it by 
file name or by file type (Applesoft, binary. Integer, or text). 

The delete, undelete, and rename commands do just what they sound 
like. An option is also available to delete files permanently from the disk. 
Also, the greeting program can be changed to any other file of any file 
type. 

Disk arRanger includes several other niceties. You can lock or un- 



lock several or all files with one command. Comment files (text flics that 
occupy directory .space but contain no information, serving the sole pur- 
pose of giving catalogs a snazzy appearance) can be added, with their 
names consisting of normal, inverse, flashing, or control characters. For 
64K Apples, an option is available that copies files to another disk. You 
can also get a display of the disk map or file map, which shows where 
free sectors are allocated. Also, the screen display can be printed at any 
time. 

Thank Preston that Disk arRanger, like all Penguin utilifies, isn't 
copy -protected. It'll be necessary to make a backup copy, since use of 
the program will likely be frequent enough to wear out the disk. With ail 
these utilities available in one small package, anyone can easily turn a 
disorganized collection of files into a neatly arranged library. lU

STOW MAKER. By Bobbit! Story Maker is an educational program with 
which children can construct illustrated stories. It contains a simple draw- 
ing program and a stripped-down word processor that are used on a hori- 
zontally split screen. About three quarters of any given screen is for the 
graphics, and the remainder, about five lines' worth, is for text. The pro- 
gram disk contains a tutorial, which is clear as far as it goes but doesn't 
go far enough in explaining how to use the program. The program disk is 
also used to format a separate data disk on which the story is saved, and 
is needed in order to switch between the drawing and writing functions. 

The word processor is fairly easy to use— probably easier for some- 
one not already loyal to a word processing program. The drawing pro- 
gram is more difficult, but probably no harder than others in this general- 
ly hard-to-operate genre— if you're a small child, or if you draw like one, 
you're not exactly going to give Chagall any competition. In addition to 
drawing lines, however, you can create different-sized squares/rectan- 
gles and circles/ovals, so even the truly klutzy can produce somewhat 
pleasing abstracts. You can fill shapes and backgrounds with any of four- 
teen shades; however, the fill routine is rather slow. 

The choice of commands in the program could have been thought out

a little better. For example, choosing L allows you to draw a line, which 
seems reasonable. But to move the cursor down a line in text-edit mode 
on a II or n Plus, you use control-L. Why not a sound-alike such as con- 
trol-D (for "down") — and why couldn't the cursor-up instruction be 
control-U instead of control-0? 

The maximum size of any one masterpiece, according to Sierra, is 
thirty pictures plus 500 lines of forty-column type— approximately twen- 
ty thousand characters, or thirteen double-spaced pages. If you use fewer 
pictures, you can use more words, and vice versa. However, regardless 
of the length of a composition, you can put only one on a disk. A story 
disk can be booted like a program disk, so you can give it to other Apple 
owners as a letter or a present (the program runs on all four versions of 
the n) but you can't print a hard copy of your work. 

The package contains a reference card, a decently written manual of 
tips on program use and style suggestions, the program disk, one data 
disk, and ten disk labels. In the booklet and on-screen tutorial, the writer 
is addressed by an elflike creature called Hack— an understandable but 
unfortunate moniker given that term's less-than-positive connotations. 

Though the program is recommended for children ages seven through 
fourteen, second-graders may find frustrating the dual-disk system, the 
number of commands, and the level of coordination needed for drawing 
and typing. It's a bit challenging even for older people, but those nine or 
over will probably enjoy it if they're on the patient side— it can take three 
hours or so to get the hang of it. Story Maker is a decent program, but 
considering that it's the latest offering in a product line being pushed by 
a major innovator in the software field, its edges seem a little rough. IP

EL-IAIR. By Saied B. Nesbat. A game that uses a new kind of strategy is 
a remarkable discovery. While El-ixir is not that, it is a nifty only-on-a- 
computer implementation of an old one, and will probably prove more 
pleasurable to many than its direct ancestor and its more sophisticated 
relatives. 



El-ixir is a two-player game (no one-player option) based on the ven- 
erable game of go, which, like chess, backgammon, and the like, is 
based on abstract military strategies of maneuvering, capturing, and con- 
quering. Those of you to whom such games have always seemed like im- 
penetrable celebrations of ennui should be able to dig this one. 

El-ixir, see, is a strategy game based on chance. Your movement 
about the go board is dictated by randomly flashing squares. When you 
see one that looks as though it might be an advantageous offensive or de- 
fensive location for your forces, you hit the button. You then get a choice 
of four directions in which to extend your influence — occupying up to 
four squares in a row. But once you select your direction, it's up to the 
whim of the gods again as to how many squares you will be allowed to 
occupy. The random numbers flash, and you wind up with your chosen 
color or pattern occupying a territory of one, two, three, or four squares. 

When you have enclosed any board area with a chain of occupied 
squares, you are given all the squares within that area, including any 
occupied by your opponent. You won't score any points, though, unless 
your chain is anchored in one of the four comers of the board. If it is, 
you receive one point for each chained or captured square. The first 
player to score more than 98 of the 196 p)ossible points is the winner. 

That's essentially it. It may sound simple, but so does checkers. It's 
unlikely that you'll play it just once. There are all kinds of subtle touches 
and strategies to this game that reveal themselves only with repeated 
play. It's amazing how infrequently you'll spot the one empty square 
that, once occupied by your near-vanquished opponent, instantly 
changes a twenty-point lead into a thirty-point deficit. It takes quite a few 
plays to become experienced. 

Does the introduction of chance dilute the cool, cerebral pleasures of 
pure strategy and tactics? For high-level war-game jocks, no doubt it 
does. For the rest of us, it means fewer rules to remember and no danger 
of being overwhelmed by a surfeit of potential strategies and bewildering 
possibilities. Think of El-ixir as training wheels. AC

At Broderbund, Big 

Broderbund Software, the San Rafael, Cali- 
fornia, based company that put more programs 
on Softalk's Top Thirty in 1983 than any other 
company besides Apple, is a unique phenome- 
non in the Apple world. When Softalk published 
"Exec Broderbund: Saga and Star Craft Spell 
Success" in November 1981, they were one of 
many small, more-or-less family companies 
that were the standard microsuccess story of the 
day. Even then, they were not ordinary. It 
wasn't just that the combination of an ex-lawyer 
(Doug Carlston), an ex-buyer for Lord and Tay- 
lor (Cathy Carlston), and an ex-Swedish wom- 
en's basketball team coach (Gary Carlston) was 
so staggeringly unusual. What most impressed 
Softalk publisher Al Tommervik, who wrote the 
story, were the fine characters of the Carlstons 
and their fledgling company. 

That much doesn't seem to have changed. 
Their reputation for fair dealing is so wide- 
spread that it came as little surprise when Doug, 
the oldest of the Carlston siblings and the presi- 
dent of Broderbund, was elected president of 
the newly formed Software Publishers Associa- 
tion by a decisive margin last June. What has 
changed is much of the rest of Broderbund. 
They're bigger, obviously, and they're consid- 
erably better known; but those things by them- 
selves are not too remarkable. 

Broderbund has escaped the usual traps 
faced by a growing company in an infant indus- 
try. Many of their contemporaries from the old 
days have dropped out of the marketplace. 
Others have intentionally limited their growth 
and survived by remaining small. A few have 
fallen victim to unexpected, unplanned, or un- 
controlled growth. Some of the programmers- 
tumed-publishers have decided that they liked it 
better on the other side of the managerial head- 
aches and have gone back to developing prod- 
ucts for other companies to sell. Broderbund 
has succeeded not only on the bottom line, but 
also in a much more elusive way: It has main- 
tained control of its growth. 



Is Just as Good 

Doug Carlston attributes Broderbund's suc- 
cess in a high-tech business to low-tech quali- 
ties. "I think our greatest strengths were that 
we always had a very conservative sort of Mis- 
souri approach to things. " (Never mind that the 
family is from Iowa.) "We required that we 
maintain profitability, and that controlled a lot 
of the way we spent money here. We plowed 
everything back into the company instead of 
taking it out in large salaries and so on." 

The quality of Broderbund's products has al- 
ways been a notable factor in the company's 
success. Carlston says, "That was a personal 
preference rather than a strategic decision." 
Nevertheless, he admits that as a strategy it 
makes a lot of sense in the long run. Most of 
Broderbund's products, both at the start, when 
it was primarily a game publisher, and now, 
with a diversifying line of home entertainment 
and productivity software, are graphic in na- 
ture. Graphic quality is an aspect of a program 
that people tend to remember, especially when 
it's very good or very bad. Broderbund's have 
tended toward the very good. "We have not 
been 100 percent successful on everything 
we've ever put out, but I think we've been 
happy with every product." 

In making the transition from a small com- 
pany to a large one, Broderbund has evolved a 
more orderly structure. The company has 
become distinctly departmentalized and has de- 
veloped a much more professional management 
group. Its products are now more often the re- 
sult of planning than of submissions from bril- 
liant, unknown programmers. Broderbund still 
gets from twenty to twenty-five unsolicited pro- 
grams a day, but it's rare that the company 
publishes one. 

On the other hand, the firm has an evalua- 
tion expert, Roy Freborg, who looks at all those 
programs and decides which ones have poten- 
tial. A few sleepers still come in that way. Lode 
Runner was one such submission. It has been a 
big seller for Broderbund and was voted the 



most popular Apple program of 1983 by Sof- 
talk's readers. A more recent program in that 
category is Karateka, an arcade game that 
Carlston says generated the most interest of all 
the entertainment products Broderbund showed 
at the Consumer Electronics Show last June. 
The program is slated for release this fall. 

Even unsolicited submissions that are ac- 
cepted go through a more rigorous period of 
evaluation and further development than they 
would have in the old days. When Broderbund 
was young, Carlston says, "it was a matter of 
Gary or me taking a look at a product when it 
came in the door and saying, 'Gee, if you did 
the following thirteen things to it, we think we 
could sell it.' " Now, the development group at 
Broderbund would be more likely to discuss not 
only programming changes but packaging 
ideas, sales opportunities, and marketing 
strategies as well. They might say, "This pro- 
gram would work well in the mass market but 
only if you can broaden the interest a little. So 
let's call it Joy of Cooking, get a license from 
them, and get some experts to help with this or 
that aspect of the program." 

The perception of a market opportunity 
comes before the programming, not after. 
Carlston says that's why the company has 
moved away from its original entertainment 
focus. The Carlston clan has observed a decline 
in the popularity of games, especially in rela- 
tionship to productivity software, certain areas 
of educational software, and serious home prod- 
ucts. "When we started, it was largely a matter 
of what we had available to sell and what the 
market liked, and now we actually try to control 
our product line. We try to shape it to the 
changing market needs while holding on to the 
products' strengths." 

When Broderbund decides to go with a proj- 
ect, whether the idea came from in-house or 
outside, a project manager is assigned to over- 
see the product's development. Carlston com- 
pares the process to that of producing or direct- 
ing a motion picture. As an example, he cited 
the development of Welcome Aboard, a Mup- 
pet-licensed computer literacy program. Hen- 
son Associates approached Broderbund with 
several ideas for a computer literacy series. 
Cricket Bird, the project manager for Welcome 
Aboard, boiled the Henson people's ideas down 
into a product design. The design was then as- 
signed to programmer Gene Kuzmiak, to start 
on the structure of the software, and to animator 
Gene Portwood to bring the artwork up to Brod- 
erbund and Muppet standards. Project manag- 
ers oversee all elements of the final products— 
the programs themselves and the parallel work 
in package design and documentation. 

The project managers come from diverse 
backgrounds, and each has unique perspectives 
to contribute to the Broderbund product line. 
Cricket Bird came to Broderbund from an edi- 
torial position with California Lawyer, a legal 
journal in the Bay Area. Richard Whittaker, a 
former television scriptwriter, is product man- 
ager for the entire Bank Street series as well as 
Print Shop. Other product managers are Rey 
Montez, a lawyer, and Ann Kronen, a recent 
graduate of Vassar College. Much of the graph- 
ics and animation in Broderbund programs are

the handiwork of Gene Port wood, who was an 
animator at Disney for eight years. 

At the top of the Broderbund organization 
are still the three Carlstons, who do much of the 
long-term strategic planning for the company. 
Gary, who claims that his current position is 
mostly honorary, focuses on special products, 
especially long-term ones. Cathy is woricing in 
marketing, at the moment trying to find a new 
director of marketing with additional experi- 
ence that she could augment through public re- 
lations activities. 

Ed Bernstein, in charge of the largest group 
at Broderbund, is director of product develop- 
ment. His work, supervising the product man- 
agers, is not unlike that of an editor-in-chief. 
Before coming to Broderbund he was city editor 
at the Independent Journal, a local newspaper 
in Broderbund's part of the world. Also a com- 
puter hobbyist, Bernstein is well qualified for 
his present position. Sharing the upper echelons 
with Bernstein and the Carlstons are Bill Mc- 
Donagh, who's in charge of planning and fi- 
nances, director of sales Stu Berman, and Brian 
Eheler, who accompanied Broderbund in its 
August 1981 move from Oregon. 

According to Carlston, Eheler "originally 
came [from Oregon] just for a month to get us 
under way and then he was never able to leave. 
We chained him to the office." Although he 
started simply as a production worker, he has 
since become less dispensable in the company. 
He is now the expert in systems; he moves from 
department to department, "designing systems 
that work and training people to use them. It's 
really a very critical function." He has worked 
in manufacturing, purchasing, and, most 
recently, sales. 

From his somewhat privileged position with- 
in the industry, Carlston has had good oppor- 
mnity to observe how the software, the people, 
and the consumers are changing with time. The 
move away from games and pure entertainment 
that the market dictated and that Broderbund 
has been following is only part of the change. 
Asked why sales are down throughout the mar- 
ketplace, he theorized, "You don't have as 
heavy a hobbyist orientation. You tend to get 
people buying computers for a specific applica- 
tion. They don't have the same breadth of inter- 
est as the early users did." He also observed 
that there is a higher dropout rate among new 
owners. They take their computers home, use 
them for a short time, then put them in the 
closet. It's hard to believe that computers have 
reached the status of impulse purchase for the 
American consumer, but it is clear that with 
their prices dropping, computers are reaching a 
less committed crowd. So computer sales climb 
and software sales drop. 

On the other hand, he sees the trend of soft- 
ware being sold in department stores as a hope- 
ful one in the long run. Because the people who 
buy programs in department stores won't have 
seen the software before buying it, they'll tend 
to buy name brands rather than known quality. 
The names they buy won't be Broderbund or 
Spinnaker anymore, but licensed names like 
Muppets, Hot Wheels, GI Joe and Barbie dolls. 
While these marketing strategies won't immedi- 
ately encourage the best software, they will 
broaden the reach of software. Consumers will 



gain sophistication over time and learn to 
recognize quality, as well as famous names. 

Despite an industry trend toward more 
businesslike modes of behavior, the Broder- 
bunders still take time to have fun together. Last 
March, to celebrate the company's fourth anni- 
versary, they held a Founders' Day Dinner. 
The Carlstons' parents, Alice and Chuck Carl- 
ston, were secretly flown out from Boston. Un- 
der the humorous guidance of programmer and 
master of ceremonies Chris Jochumson, the em- 
ployees and parents of the founders proceeded 
to roast them in a manner Dean Martin would 
have approved of. 

And this month the Carlston family and 
friends will convene again, not once but twice, 
for a more serious but equally happy purpose: 
the consecutive weddings of Doug Carlston to 
Mary Crowley and Cathy Carlston to Tim Bris- 
bois. Neither Crowley nor Brisbois is in the in- 
dustry: Crowley founded and runs Ocean Voy- 
ages, a company that arranges and books sailing 
adventures to the ends of the earth; and Brisbois 
is a food service consultant who plays a mean 
game of golf. In a business that rarely allows 
people time for lives outside the office, these 
events reveal one of the most extraordinary 
aspects of Broderbund life. 

Anyone who has brothers or sisters is likely 
to have wondered, at one time or another, what 
it would be like to work with them. According 
to Doug Carlston, it's interesting. "It's fun be- 
cause it gives you a chance to see the people you 
love. And it's also very hard because there are a 
lot of strains involved in running an organiza- 
tion; companies and people have different and 
changing needs. It really depends on the nature 
of the brothers and sisters and their relationship 
with one another. But I sure wouldn't dissuade 
anybody from doing it if they thought it was 
right, because it's certainly been an exciting 
thing for our whole family." 

He says with some regret that Broderbund is 
not really a family company anymore, with 
more than seventy employees worjcing there 
now. But an outside observer can see— from the 
way that the family at the top has set a tone and 
established a flavor for Broderbund, from the 
way the people there work together and play to- 
gether, and from the way Carlston talks about 
the people he works with— that this isn't en- 
tirely true, and he doesn't wholly believe it 
himself. —David Durkee

AUGUST 1984 



101 



something new when microcomputers appeared 
on the scene. Specializing in programming the 
6502, the man started his own software com- 
pany—Small Business Computer Systems. 

Four years ago, he was interviewed by a 
young computer publication. An article on 
handicapped Apple users appeared in the sec- 
ond issue of that magazine and the man was fea- 
tured prominently. Shortly after that, a woman 
recently hired by the man read the article and 
began to understand him a little better. 

Now the man and woman are married, the 
company is still going strong, and the magazine 
is about to begin its fifth year of publication. 

The man is Dave McFarling; the woman is 
Diane Walkowiak; and the magazine is Softalk. 
McFarling 's story was first told in the October 

1980 issue by Softalk's editor Margot Comstock 
Tommervik. A year later, in the November 

1981 issue, a letter appeared in Open Discus- 
sion from Diane Walkowiak. She wrote, "I'd 
like to thank Softalk for its role in the romance. 
Dave was too modest then to tell me of his ac- 
complishments. I had to read about them in a 
magazine. Your article impressed me and gave 
me the determination to stick with a job I was 
unsure of, and I'm so glad I did." 

McFarling 's story is far from over. A fine 
programmer, he has marketed several account- 
ing packages for farmers and has seen his com- 
pany grow from two employees to eight in the 
last four years. He has more products in the 
works and is actually worried about the com- 
pany growing too fast. 

"Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd 
be wrestling with a growth problem," he says. 

McFarling 's Small Business Computer Sys- 
tems is currently concentrating on accounting 
programs for agricultural applications. McFarl- 
ing says that agricultural software is the fastest- 
growing vertical market in the software indus- 
try today. Even so, farmers are not the easiest 
customer base to educate and satisfy. 

Farmers are slow to change. It's safer to let 
your neighbor try something new and see if it 
works. "It took some farmers eight years to re- 
alize high red seed com was the best to grow," 
says McFarling. Within farming communities, 
there are usually one or more innovators — farm 
talk for hackers. McFarling believes that the in- 
novators are helping to bring computers into the 
farming process and that the market is stepping 
up. 

"I don't think the software industry is that 
far behind the hardware manufacturers. When I 
look at the package I brought out four years 
ago, I'm embarrassed to admit that I wrote it. 
It's ironic. Not many farmers are aware of the 
changes that have occurred in this industry . 
When they're buying a computer today they're 
taking advantage of all our mistakes." 

McFarling 's Agri-Ledger and General Ac- 
counting are currently available for the Apple 
II. This fall, McFarling hopes to have some- 
thing for the Macintosh. The company tries to 
work with the dealer base as much as possible 
but also sells directly to customers, most of 
whom live in rural areas. 

"One of the other big problems," says Mc- 
Farling, "is that farmers don't understand com- 
puters and the dealers don't understand farm- 
ers. We've been joking about writing a Farming 



101 handbook for dealers." 

Since Softalk first interviewed McFarling 
about the life of a handicapped computer user, 
his equipment has pretty much stayed the same. 
His requirements for a system are more a matter 
of placement than a need for special equipment. 
Still, the addition of a half-height disk drive that 
physically ejects disks has proven helpful. 

McFarling still does most of the program- 
ming at SBCS. He's directly responsible for the 
products and works with a small staff. "I'd 
rather do that than manage the whole compa- 
ny." Programming is a very big part of Mc- 
Farling 's life. 

He also appreciates the more entertaining 
and relaxing uses of the Apple. A pilot when he 
served in the armed forces, McFarling likes to 
play with SubLogic's Flight Simulator. Most 
action games are too difficult for McFarling to 
play because of his inability to move his fingers. 
But he says the Apple "plays a mean game of 
chess." 

A man with a will to live courageously de- 
spite his physical shackles, McFarling is part of 
what is known around Lincoln as the E-Team— 
the Nebraska Land Communications Emergen- 
cy Team. Among other things, the E-Team 
maintains several groups that specialize in spot- 
ting twisters during a tornado watch. Lincoln is 
smack-dab in the middle of Tornado Alley and 
has more spotter points per capita than any other 
city in the United States. 

"It's a fact that less than 5 percent of tor- 
nados are spotable by radar before they touch 
the ground," McFarling explains. Assistant to 
his local E-Team group's civil coordinator, Mc- 



Farling is prepared to stop what he's doing at 
the time of a tornado watch— including sleep- 
ing—to man the Lancaster County Emergency 
Operations Center, maintaining communica- 
tions with spotters' posts, the weather bureau, 
and civil defense units. "There's no monetary 
reward for doing this," .says McFarling. "It's 
strictly volunteer. But there's the self-satisfac- 
tion of doing a good job." 

Diane Walkowiak is very much involved 
with the running of SBCS. She owns a piece of 
the company and is currently SBCS's business 
manager. "The company is definitely going 
places," she says with enthusiasm. A "people 
person" as opposed to a programmer, Diane 
counts on Dave to handle the technical side. 
"To think logically, continually, drives me up 
the wall." 

Dave and Diane will celebrate their third an- 
niversary on August 15. Both are happy and ex- 
cited about their business. Diane says that to 
this day she drags out that original Softalk arti- 
cle and shows it to new employees. It helps 
them understand who Dave is and what he has 
accomplished. Invariably, reading the article 
helps smooth over any awkward feelings about 
Dave's handicap. 

What McFarling said in that issue three 
years and ten months ago is the best way to end 
this story. "Nothing, absolutely nothing, is im- 
possible. True, there are some things the world 
is not yet ready for— or not yet willing to ac- 
cept. When the chips are down, the difference 
between the possible and the impossible is the 
true measure of a man's ability."

Paint and promises are what've been respon- 
sible for Macintosh's resounding success to 
date. The "Paint" is of course MacPaint, and it 
very graphically demonstrates the quality of soft- 
ware we can expect for our Macs— just as soon 
as some of Apple's expansive promises of new 
software are fulfilled. 

Which should be just about two weeks into 
this month. That's the day that Telos Software 
is releasing Filevision, which can quite honestly 
be called the first independently developed pro- 
gram to deliver on the "Macintosh promise." 

Filevision is a first, ft's a program whose ca- 
reer is as a database manager, but whose heart 
is in Art. The program manages to use Mac's 
graphics capabilities not only to make database 
operations easier but also to make them more 
effective. Looking at a demo of a prerelease 
version, which itself appeared to be far more of 
a finished product than some of the "produc- 
tion" software being sold by ... ah ... as I 
was saying, looking at the demo, you couldn't 
help but get some of the same feeling that must 
have been engendered by the first peeks at 
VisiCalc. 

But enough of this rosy descriptive fluff. 
Let's get serious and say that Filevision is an 
object-oriented filing system allowing the user 
to key database information to a picture and 
then retrieve that info by pointing at the picture. 

Filevision' s graphics are very similar to 
those found in LisaDraw (and MacDraw, of 
which we've already seen beta test copies), 
which simply means that the individual ele- 
ments (a.k.a. objects) that form a picture in File- 
vision maintain their identity. To use Filevision, 
you draw the picture much as you would in Lisa- 
Draw and then associate certain elements of the 
picture with records in a database. Later, you 
just click on part of the picture to call up the as- 
sociated data. Imagine how useful that could be, 
for example, to a parts man looking at a sche- 
matic diagram of an engine. Customers could 
simply point to the dpohickey in question, and, 
as if by magic, part numbers, inventory infor- 
mation, and other useful tids and bits would 
automatically appear. This is a product that's 
going to extend the boundaries of usefulness of 
personal computers. 

Telos Software is a large software house 
whose parent company, Telos Corporation, 
does the programming for some of NASA's 



A Different Form of Filing 

space shots. The professional touch is evident m 
Filevision, from the opening screen right down 
to the documentation. At $195 retail, Telos 
looks to have a winner on its hands. 

Paint and Promises, huh? Okay, for you ap- 
plication types, this month brought Filevision, 
but the hacker types haven't been forgotten: We 
have recently seen announcements for not one, 
not two, but— yes, folks, count 'em— three C 
compilers. (That's three (3) compilers of the C 
persuasion, not one Three-C compiler, for 
those of you who just joined.) 

The first of the three Cs to reach the market 
should be Aztec C68K from Manx Software 
(Shrewsbury, NJ)— which at press time was 
calling for an official release date of August 1 . 
Manx will be offering two versions, one com- 
mercial and one "personal"; both are promised 
to be full K & R compilers. (No, it doesn't stand 
for kut and run; it stands for Kemighan and Rit- 
chie, the authors of The C Programming Lan- 
guage, the bible of serious C users and abusers. 
C is too tempting not to abuse, bible or not.) In 
addition to a Mac native compiler, Manx will be 
offering cross-development systems for 
CP/M-86, the PDP-11, VAXes, the Lisa, and 
MS-DOS. (The last is the OS of the IBM PC. 
There. I've said it.) Both versions include the 
compiler, full Unix system library, editor, and 
shell command environment. The commercial 
system will include full access to the Macintosh 
Toolbox, as well as dynamically relocatable 
code of virtually unlimited size. Prices for the 
personal version start at $199. 

Come September, Softworks Limited's C 
compiler should hit the market. This too sounds 
like a very good system; it's a complete C com- 
piler, again with full access to all 483.2 (or 
whatever the number is; even Apple doesn't 
seem to know for sure) ROM routines. Soft- 
works's compiler even spits out assembly code 
compatible with Apple's own assembler-debug- 
ger. Even better, the company has a deal 
worked out so that buyers of the compiler can 
pick up the assembler for a mere pittance (fif- 
teen or twenty-five pittances, actually). Soft- 
works's Macintosh C will go for $395 and will 
include the phone number of an actual person 
you can talk to should you run into troubles with 
the compiler. (This is not a rationale for not 
reading the manual, mind you.) That person is 
Bob Salita, one of the founders of Club Mac. 




You can get in touch with Salita and Softworks 
Limited at (312) 975-4030. Salita says Mac C 
runs the Byte benchmark more than 200 times 
faster than Microsoft Basic. 

More information on these two compilers, 
plus a third coming from Hippopotamus Soft- 
ware (Sunnyvale, CA) as soon as our Mac 
wraps its hungry little disk drive around them. 

Davong finally sent us a copy of their ten- 
megabyte hard disk, and it's a beauty. I mean 
that literally— it's long and low and looks quite 
nice sitting on a desktop. The Tecmar cartridge 
hard disk looks like a beige toaster, although to 
its credit is the fact that it takes up slightly less 
space on a desk. 

This is not going to be a complete review of 
the Davong disk, or even an incomplete review. 
For that matter, it's not going to be a review, 
period— a minireview wUl follow later. 

Speaking of disks, you'll discover when you 
use a hard disk that Apple's method of dealing 
with folders is woefully inadequate. Consider 
the following: 

You fire up MacWrite and innocently try to 
open up a file. MacWrite, good trooper that it 
is, presents its standard little directory window, 
from which you can choose the file you want. 

Whoops! If you're working on a hard disk, 
that directory could have hundreds of listings, 
because all MacWrite files in all folders on the 
disk will be shown. Trying to find the file you 
named last night at 3:00 a.m. in that jumble of 
file names . . . well, it's not going to be fun. 

The folder system that the Mac uses to store 
files is really no more than a new name for the 
hierarchical file structure found in such mun- 
dane operating systems as ProDOS, Unix, or 
IBM's PC-DOS. (Yes, Virginia, if you scrape 
back that chic and glossy exterior, you will find 
a ... a computer! Imagine that.) In a properly 
behaving hierarchical file structure, however, if 
you asked for a directory, you would get the di- 
rectory of the current folder. And that's exacdy 
what the Mac should do: When MacWrite pre- 
sents you with the open file directory, the direc- 
tory listing should be limited to either folders 
that are currently open on the desktop (the cur- 
rent folder) or other folders that you have in 
some way explicitly chosen. (Maybe a second 
window should be presented, from which you 
can pick folders of interest.) Something needs to 
be done. (Apple, are you listening?) Jl 



What made over 100,000 
Apple II owners fall In love 
with System Saver? 



It's the most versatile, most convenient, most 
useful peripheral ever made for the Apple.' 

System Saver filters out damaging AC line 
noise and power surges. 

70-90% of all microcomputer malfunctions can be 
traced to power line problems* Problems your 
System Saver guards against. 

Power line noise can often be interpreted as data. 
This confuses your computer and produces system 
errors. Power surges and spikes can cause severe 
damage to your Apple's delicate circuitry and lead 
to costly servicing. 

System Saver clips surges and 
spikes at a 130 Volts RMS/175 
Volts dc level. A PI type filter 
attenuates common and 
transverse mode noise by a 
minimum of 30 dB from 600 
kHz to 20 mHz with a max- 
imum attenuation of 50 dB . 
You end up with an Apple 
that's more accurate, more 
efficient and more reliable. 



System Saver lets your Apple keep its cool. 

Today's advanced peripheral cards generate heat. In 
addition, the cards block any natural air flow through 
the Apple He creating high temperature conditions 
that shorten the life of the Apple and peripheral cards. 

System Saver's efficient, quiet 
fan draws fresh air across 
the mother board, over 
the power supply and 
out the side ventilation 

slots. It leaves your Apple cool, calm and running 

at top speed. 




SYSTEM SAVER 





System Saver makes your Apple more 
convenient to use. 

No more reaching around to the back of your Apple 
to turn It on. No more fumbling for outlets and cords 
to plug m your monitor and printer System Saver 
organizes all your power needs. 



So if you want to keep 
damaging heat, line noise and power surges out of 
your system for good, pick up the only peripheral 
that's in use every second your computer is in use. 
The System Saver. You'll soon come to think of it as 
the piece Apple forgot. 

Compatible with Apple stand

Mind Your 






BY PETER OLIVIERI 




Investment Software, Mailing List Packages, News, and Speculations 



In the course of this installment, we'll cover 
news of Mac, Lisa, and the Apple EH, consider 
what's involved in choosing a mailing list pro- 
gram, mention some new products, and specu- 
late about the future. But before we do all that, 
let's focus on an area we haven't touched on of 
late — namely, using your computer as an invest- 
ment management/analysis tool. 

Indeed, there are a variety of ways you 
might use a computer to satisfy your financial 
management needs. One way is by using a 
spreadsheet package to design a model that 
manages your stocks. This is not an especially 
difficuh model to build, particularly if you're 
one of those who have been using spreadsheet 
models for a while. A second option is to use a 
database management system to help you man- 
age your holdings. The trouble with both these 
options is that they're limited— the first by your 
own knowledge about and ability to construct 
financial planning models, and the second by 
the limitations of the package itself (for exam- 
ple, not all database managers offer the user ex- 
tensive mathematical capabilities). 

For the serious investor, a better choice is 
the purchase of a software package that's been 
designed specifically for the application he or 
she has in mind. There are two basic types of 
applications software for the investor: stock 
analysis packages and portfolio management 
systems. 

An analytical package will usually contain a 
variety of complex mathematical models that 
can be used for tracking, predicting, and ana- 
lyzing what's happening to some of your hold- 
ings or to the market in general. Effective use of 
such a package requires that you have a pretty 
good handle on what the information some of 
these methods generate might mean. You'd be 
unwise, for example, to request an "exponen- 
tially smoothed forecast" of the value of your 
holdings if you had no idea what the strengths 
and weaknesses of such a method might be. But 
if you know the territory, so to speak, having 
the ability to perform various analyses of the 
market may give you a significant advantage in 
planning your purchases and sales. 

A portfolio management system helps you 
manage your portfolio (that is, your investment 
holdings) by keeping track of your past actions 
and of any gains or losses you may incur as a re- 
sult of present actions. A portfolio management 
system is similar to a database management sys- 
tem in that it keeps records for you and allows 
you to look over what has happened at any time. 
Such a package provides far less sophisticated 
capability than an analytical package; but not 
everyone is analytical, and you may find that a 
portfolio manager is just what you need to help 
you manage your money more effectively. 



There are a couple of things to look out for 
in your search for such packages. Once you've 
identified whether or not you want an analytical 
package or a portfolio manager, you must de- 
cide how you'll obtain the data that forms a 
basis for any work you want to do. Most users 
sign on with one of the computerized informa- 
tion services that provide up-to-date stock 
quotes and historical data. The most popular is 
the Dow Jones News/Retrieval Service, al- 
though more than fifty companies offer similar 
services. 

Also worth noting are your setup costs. 
Your expenses include the cost of the stock 
analysis or portfolio management software 
package and the cost of the services provided by 
an information utility (there will be a sign-up 
fee and a user fee); if you don't already have 
them, you'll need to purchase a modem and 
some communications software. 

Some other general questions to ask include: 

1. Does the package you're considering 
allow you to display and print charts and graphs 
of the stored information? (It's often easier to 
spot a trend or identify a trouble spot if you can 
see a picture of it.) 

2. How many stocks can be managed by the 
system? How much information can be stored 
on disk? 

3. How many different kinds of investments 
can the package handle? Can it accommodate 
mutual funds, bonds, options, and preferred 
stocks? 

4. Does the package keep records of all your 
gains and losses? Will it maintain the ap- 
propriate tax records? 

It's a sure bet that many of you are sophisti- 
cated investors who could name specific fea- 
tures you'd require as a part of any investment 
package you'd consider using. Let's hear from 
you. Drop a note and tell other business users 
what investment package you'd recommend 
(and why), what services you find particularly 
appealing, and anything else about money man- 
agement you think might be helpful. 

Mail Call. There are two basic types of 
mailing list programs. First are those that act in 
many ways like a database system and are capa- 
ble of retrieving information for printing in a 
variety of formats. Second are mail-merge ap- 
plication programs that can be used to merge in- 
formation into form letters. 

If you're considering a mailing list program, 
ask yourself the following questions to help 
make the best choice: 

1 . How many names and addresses can the 
program store? A program's label storage 
capacity may range anywhere from 100 to 
50,000, depending on the program. 

2. How many lines per label does the system 



allow? Some systems allow only three lines. 
Five-line labels are becoming more common in 
the business environment, however, and certain 
programs will let you have five lines. 

3. How many labels does the system print 
across a page? The range here is anywhere from 
one to five. 

4. Does the system permit the user to define 
the order in which labels are printed? For exam- 
ple, is it possible to specify that labels are to be 
printed in zip code order? 

5. Does the system allow the printing of se- 
lected labels only? That is, can you print only 
the labels from a particular city or zip code 
range, or only those in which a certain title 
appears? 

6. Does the system offer word processing 
capabilities so that you can merge your names 
and addresses into a form letter for printing? 

7. How fast is the program? The speed with 
which labels can be prepared is important. Sor- 
ting can also be slow or fairly fast, depending 
on the techniques used. It's worthwhile to 
get some comparative information about the

time various programs require to print, say, 
500 labels. 

If the mailing list you wish to maintain is 
fairly small, and if you really don't need sophis- 
ticated word processing capabilities, you'd do 
well to contact your local Apple user group and 
to check out issues of various Apple-oriented 
magazines. You just may find a Basic program 
to type in that will serve your purposes just fine. 
If you have fewer than two hundred records, 
you might want to consider Apple Computer's 
Quick File lie. For larger files, Arrays/Cond- 
nental's First Class Mail and Software Publish- 
ing 's PFS.File are worthy candidates. 

Apple in News. Although Apple has stopped 
development activities on the Apple III, there's 
still quality software being created for this ma- 
chine. One package that's getting a strong re- 
ception from Apple IQers who've used it is /// 
E-Z Pieces, from Haba Systems. Priced at 
$295, this integrated package contains a word 
processor, a spreadsheet, and a database 
management system. Be sure to look carefully 
at the features offered in each of the programs 
included in the package. The "pieces" are not as 
powerful as standalone packages for the same 
applications would be, but the package is easy 
to use, well documented, and quite thorough for 
most applications. 

The Lisa/Mac Impact. It's obvious to al- 
most everyone that these new machines are hav- 
ing a big impact at Apple. Among the indica- 
tions of this is the fact that Imagewriter printers 
are being sold first with these machines; Lisas 
get them if there are any left over, and Apple lis 
are at the bottom of the priority list for these 
printers. Imagewriters seem to be selling as fast 
as they come off the line. 

Other things are not coming off the line as 
fast as they will eventually. Expect to see a 
greater volume of Macs in early fall and again 
in midwinter. Meanwhile, January still seems to 
be the time we'll start seeing 512K Macs. The 
chips that are to be used are the same ones that 
would be needed for Apple's not-yet-announced 
laser printer. At some point, one will have to 
take priority over the other. 

In other news, a wide-carriage Imagewriter 
is now available (and much in demand). Contact 
Apple or your dealer for details. 

What's in Apple's Future? The laser print- 
er and a 512K Mac are hot, eagerly awaited 
items. Now, while we're on the subject of the 
future, what else would you like to see? How 
about a color Macintosh (or some kind of inter- 
face to achieve color on the Mac)? Or a Mac 
with Apple's own microprocessor? Or how 
about a machine that can "become" any other 
machine at the wish of the user? 

Why not think it over and then send in your 
description of what you'd like Apple's business 
computer system of 1986 to look like? In a fu- 
ture colunui, we'll summarize the thoughts and 
suggestions received; perhaps the picture that 
emerges will influence what really happens. Ill

" My accountant laughed at me when I 
told him I was doing my own books, 
but then \ showed him my Balance 
Sheet ". 

I am an independent type of businessman and it has always bothered me that I 
had to take my books to someone else. I always wanted do my own, but I'm not 
much of a bookkeeper. I knew if I was going to do my own books that I would 
need a reliable computer like the Apple"", and a strong business software 
package. Something that would not be too overwhelming to me, yet give me 
complete coverage of my business; and still be easy enough for my secretary to 
run, when I am away from the office. I had certainly heard of the Apple Ke"* 
computer and how reliable it was, from Jim, a fellow 1 had met while golfing 
last week. But I didn't know of a good business package, and quite frankly, 1 was 
a little nervous about trying everything on my own. 

I started visiting computer stores, trying to find the package that was right for me. but they Just didn't 
seem to have what I was looking for. Then one day , while I was out shopping, I ran into Jim at the coffee 
shop, and told him that I had become totally frustrated in my search for business software. Jim was 
surprised that I was actually going to computerize my business, and said he had gone through the same 
thing about a year before. He told me how he was looking for a package that could do billing, invoicing, 
payables, general ledger and payroll , and had finally heard of a package from a company called Westware. 
He ordered the package and had been using It with greet success. 

I was glad to hear Jim was experienced with software, but i told him I needed a complete package, and 

that Receivables must not only do billing, but also be able to charge interest to selected customers and do 

invoicing. Also payables had to print checks and produce reports, to help me with cash flow. 

Jim said I was in for quite a surprise. Not only did receivables do what I wanted, but it also interacted 

with Inventory, and would report all accounting directly to the General Journal after generating an 

invoice. 

Also the Payables did more than just produce checks. It had a loan amortization program for calculating 
interest on loans, wA automatically did correct occtHjnting whoi you made a loan payonent, applyir^ so 
much to interest and the rest to principal. 

Now that really impressed me, but how about payroll? I was sick of looking up payroll taxes every 

week. Jim said that payroll is so easy that the secretary can do it in only a few minutes, and it handles 

complicated deductions like IRA, as well as simple bonus pay and insurance deductions. 

Jim finally explained that I could also produce my own Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Statement 

anytime I needed, instead of having to wait to get it back from the accountant. 

Well , my search was over and I ordered the BREAKAWAY*" package immediately, and was up and running 

in no time, producing my own Balance Sheet the very first month. 

Jack , my accountant, stopped by to ask why I hadn't been in to see him lately. He laughed when I told him 
I was doing my own books, but then \ showed him my Balance Sheet.

bookkeeping system can be II Call or write Westware Inc.

Nights of the 

If you missed June's cliffhanger, call our back-issues department. 
You wouldn't want to read the exciting conclusion before you had a 
chance to examine all the clues, would you? 

In the June column's Shape Designer program, we have a tool for 
designing single shapes and saving them into binary files in a way that is 
useless. As it stands, that is. This month's program. Shape Table Assem- 
bler, puts utility into our utility. 

Another Old World Craft Bytes the Dust. A lot has been written 
detailing how to create shape tables "by hand." It calls to mind romantic 
images of the skills passed from generation to generation in the family of 
Juan Valdez, doesn't it? Don't bet on it. Creating shape tables by hand is 
very boring work. First you have to understand what vector means, then 
you have to learn binary, then you have to learn hexadecimal, then you 
have to learn some of the most absurd rules invented by man since Cap- 
tain Kirk came up with Double Fizzbin. Even if you want to learn binary 
and hexadecimal, which are useful in advanced programming, no human 
really needs to spend part of his or her precious childhood, brief ado- 
lescence, or otherwise sane adulthood learning yet another set of stu- 
pid rules. 

If you disagree on principle, proceed directly to whichever version of 
the Applesoft reference manual you might have and read about it there. 
Or (special one-time offer here) the first person to write in can get the 
one and only copy of the original manuscript for this month's column, 
which contained a valiant but hopeless attempt to cover the subject more 
succinctly than anyone else has. Oh well. 

For the rest of you, this month's program is presented not as an edu- 
cational exercise but as an important utility so that we can all learn how 
to use shape tables without getting our fingernails dirty. Hence, the rest 
of the article explains not how the program works internally but rather 
how to use it. 

The Overblown List Editor. When you run the program, you get a 
blank screen with a greater-than sign in the upper left corner and instruc- 
tions displayed at the bottom, as shown in figure 1. 

This display is created by lines 1410 and 1420 of the program. If it 
doesn't look like this when you run the program, you may have to fiddle 
around with the spaces in line 1420 until it does. That one line prints 
three screen lines from AFfor files to escape to assemble. The line must 
be padded with spaces so that the second screen line begins with the 
forty-first character of the string and the third screen line begins with the 



"F FOR FILES ARROWS TO MOUE POINTER 

"D TO DELETE 'I TO INSERT BLANK 

"E TO EDIT ENTRY ESCAPE TO ASSEMBLE 




Shape Table 

eighty-first character. When you type the line in on a forty-column 
display, it should look something like the line as shown in figure 2. 

The important thing to notice is that the characters that will begin the 
second and third lines on the screen when the string is printed will be 
directly beneath the character that begins the first line. There is no space 
between the end of the word pointer and the caret in AD; those 
characters wiU be separated by a line break when the lines are printed on- 
screen. 

Follow the Printed Prompts. This section of the program allows you 
to enter and edit a list of shape names. These will be shapes you have 
created with June's Shape Designer program, which adds the prefix SH. , 
short for shape, to the name you specified. To distinguish Shape 
Designer's files from those created by this program (both use binary 
files). Shape Assembler uses the prefix ST. , short for shape table. You 
don't have to type the SH. prefix when entering shape names in the list; 
the program adds it to the name automatically . 

To get a list of the files on a disk, type control-F. That's what the aF 
for files line at the bottom of the screen means. The caret is a traditional 
symbol for«a control character; although it isn't used much in the Apple 
II world, it is used here because it is the shortest of the conventional 
shorthand forms. Because there is no easy way in Applesoft to have the 
computer look at a catalog and display only the names of the kind of files 
you're looking for, control-F gives you a standard catalog list from 
which you wOl have to pick out shape files. (If you'd like a way to have 
your programs read the catalog, then read this month's Ilnd Grade 
Chats.) When the catalog is finished listing, hit a key and the edit screen 
will return. 

The greater-than sign in the comer of the screen is a pointer to the 
currently selected item in the list. Since there are no items in the list yet, 
you can't move it around. However, if you type the word house and hit 
return, you will be able to use the left and right arrows to move the 
pointer back and forth between the word house and the blank space to the 
right of it. Stop at the blank space and type a few more words and you'll 
be able to move the pointer through the list of words. 

Notice that when you start typing a word, the display at the bottom of 
the screen changes to what is shown in figure 3. That's because the other 
commands are no longer active; now you're in the typing mode. The left 
arrow deletes a character and return accepts the word and moves the 
pointer to the next space. Notice that hitting return or deleting all the

ERT BLANK ' E TO EDIT ENTRY ESCAPE TO

Figure 3. 



characters in a word returns the display at the bottom of the screen to its 
former state. All those commands have come back into effect. 

The remaining commands are control-E, used to edit; control-D, 
used to delete; control-I, used to insert; and escape, to assemble. If you 
move the pointer to a word and hit control-E, you will be able to add to 
it, delete from it, or change it. The second prompt display comes back 
and a flashing cursor appears at the end of the word as if you had just fin- 
ished typing the word but hadn't yet hit return. 

If instead of editing a word you want to replace it completely, just 
move the pointer to the word and start typing the new one. The old word 
will disappear as soon as you start to type the new one. 

If you want to delete a word but not replace it with anything, move 
the pointer to the word and hit control-D. The words after it will move in 
to fill its space. On the other hand, if you want to add a new word at a 
certain point in the list but don't want to delete the one that's already 
there, hit control-I. The words after the pointer will move over to make 
a space for you to type the new word in. 

Easy To Assemble; Batteries Not Included. When the list meets 
your approval, hit escape to assemble it into a shape table. Normally, the 
word assemble is used with computers to talk about the process of turn- 
ing assembly language listings into machine language code, but the proc- 
ess being performed here is pretty similar, so we're bending the rules 
of terminology. There's no jargon more satisfying than jargon you 
make up. 

When the program assembles the shape table, it displays each shape 
after encoding it. If it runs across a shape name in your list that isn't on 
the disk, it gives you the opportunity to skip that shape (when you tell it 
to draw the shape, it won't draw anything, but the rest of the table will 
still function), abort the assembly, or change disks. With this option, you 
can assemble shapes from more than one disk. 

When the assembly is finished, you will be prompted for a file name 
for the shape table. Type a name and the program wUl save the table in a 
form that Applesoft can use. Next time, we'll look at how to use the 
shapes you can create with this program to do things like simulation, 
animation, and hi-res labeling of graphs. If you want to get started right 
away, the shape table you create will be in memory when you have fin- 
ished running this program. Line 460 may provide some hints on how to 
use it.

What is psychic phenomena? 

At this point, no one knows. Could it be possible to use the 
power of the mind to look back into the past, forward into the 
future, or to remote places in the present? Stephan Schwartz, 
chairman and research director of the Mobius Society, a Los 
Angeles-based psychic research group, has some ideas. 

"There is evidence that it has a strong acculturated factor," 
posits Schwartz. "If you are an aboriginal bushman, knowing 
that a gazelle is on the other side of the hill may be the difference 
between eating and not eating. If you are a Marine platoon leader 
and you need to know where the guys who are trying to kill you 
are, it becomes extremely important that you use all your 
senses— including your intuitive one— to keep your men from get- 
ting zapped. And there is evidence— quite a lot of it— that there 
have been some platoon leaders who had it and some who didn't. 
In Vietnam, as reported in the New York Times and The Observer, 
the Marines ended up teaching people to dowse (use a divining 
rod) to find Viet Cong tunnels because they found it was the only 
way they could do it." 

Schwartz also refers to a series of studies done using chief ex- 
ecutive officers of large corporations {Executive ESP, Schroeder 
and Ostrander, Prentice-Hall). The correlation between being 
able to do a precognitive task and the profit-making ability of the 
executive's company was so straightforward that the researchers 



could look at the balance sheet of the company and tell how well 
the CEO would do on the precognition test. 

"It seems to be a normal human trait," says Schwartz, "an 
information signal that living organisms— at least, human 
beings— possess, subject to acculturation. Margaret Mead made 
the point that in those cultures that bring it forward, it tends to 
flourish. Those cultures that suppress it don't seem to have it ex- 
cept in very specialized ways. We don't usually call it psychic 
functioning. We say 'they have good hunches' or 'they've got a 
good track record, a feel for the marketplace.' When you test 
these people on specific, formal, academic, parapsychological 
tests, they do well. 

"It is present, but we don't know how widely present, and be- 
cause of the cultural factors it's very hard to get a baseline meas- 
urement of what the human organism is capable of doing, because 
by the time you can test people, they've been heavily accul- 
turated." 

Reality busters. Schwartz— formerly special assistant for re- 
search and analysis to the U.S. chief of naval operations, editorial 
staffer with National Geographic, and associate editor of Psychic 
magazine— founded Mobius in 1977 as "a nonprofit organization 
to research extended human performance." 

In addition to performing the usual business of a psychic re- 
search lab, conducting theoretical experiments to test the exis- 



mm 



tence of psychic phenomena, Mobius specializes in the practical 
applications of psychic ability, particularly in archaeology and 
criminology. Schwartz and company take the existence of psychic 
phenomena as a given, and they get results— real, incontestable, 
unexplainable-by-any-other-means results. Mobius uses the "tri- 
ple-blind" type of psychic experiment— one in which the correct 
answer involves an event that has not yet occurred and is not 
known to the subject, the researcher, or anyone else. As Mobius 
executive director Rand De Mattel points out, the results of such 
an experiment "could not possibly have been falsified or planted, 
and could not have happened by chance." 

Why is parapsychology still considered to dwell on the shady, 
outermost fringes of science?

standing before a map of Alexandria. Circled areas are those in which 
psychics sensed that archaeological finds would be made. Below: 
Research submersible Taurus I, used in Project Deep Quest. A previously 
unknown wreck off Santa Catalina Island was located by psychic 
respondents, who also described specific objects that would be found. 




Schwartz is well acquainted with the particularly militant vari- 
ety of close-mindedness that is the special hazard of his profes- 
sion. He ascribes it to a four-part "Grand Material Metapara- 
digm," which forms a sort of personality profile of twentieth- 
century humankind: "The mind is the result of physiological 
processes governed by bioelectrical impulses; each consciousness 
is a discrete entity; organic evolution moves toward no specific 
goal but simply flows according to Darwinian survivalism; and 
there is only one time-space continuum, and it provides for only 
one reality." 

To gain any degree of serious acceptance, psychic research 
must overcome, or disprove, nothing less than the primary 
bulwark of the currently accepted beliefs by which the majority of 
us live. 

"I See a Multicolored Fruit with a Bite Out of It." 

Schwartz describes Mobius 's use of psychic respondents as a 
system of "consensual methodology," the same system used by a 
detective or a reporter who interviews a number of people about 
an event that the reporter/detective has not seen. "Not everybody 
would see it correctly; not everybody would see everything; but if 
you interviewed them all individually, you would get, in the 
aggregate, a pretty clear picture of what had taken place. We do 
the same thing." 

When transcribing interviews with a project's respondents, or 



DUUULlU 



cm

intuitive witnesses, Mobius looks for patterns— similar ideas or 
phrases and descriptions of places or events that could be matched 
up with each other. 

"I used to type the transcriptions of these interviews out," he 
recalls. "I would cut each sentence into a little strip of papjer, like 
a fortune cookie paper, then rent a big space or go to a high 
school gymnasium. I'd lay these things down and put lead 
washers on top of them with little flags on suction cups for the 
headlines. I'd keep moving around, and I'd create a kind of 
database— a dBase II in real space— only I was the computer. It 
was crazy. I came in about five o'clock one morning after work- 
ing sixteen hours, and someone had turned the air conditioning on 
and blown it all away. I knew I had to get a computer."

When De Mattel joined Mobius five years ago, he already 
owned an Apple. Mobius has since purchased two, one of which 
was stolen and replaced by a recent donation. Another research- 
er, David C. Keith, residing at Lake Tahoe, California, commu- 
nicates with Schwartz and De Mattel via modem. They now use 
the Apples for all report writing and analysis, articles, and books, 
and will soon be moving all their accounts onto them. 

"We have developed a kind of database program that we tied 
into our word processor," says Schwartz. "It's very un- 
sophisticated, but it's very effective for us. The Apples are 
essential." 

Rand De Mattel brought more than his Apple when he joined 
Mobius. With Schwartz, he thought up the idea of conducting an 
ongoing, cross-cultural mass experiment to determine the 
distribution of psychic ability in the general population and to see 
whether there might be some kind of psychological profile that 
would correlate with the greatest incidence of those abilities. Us- 
ing the results of the test, dubbed the Psi Q series and published in 
Omni magazine in the U.S. and Japan, they reasoned that it might 
be possible to predict what kinds of people would be 
psychologically disposed toward precognition. (Currently, 
results heavily favor extroverts.) 

"We've since carried out several such experiments, with 
twenty-three thousand people taking part," says De Mattel. "The

first one was a precognitive task, predicting a fairly abstract 
computer-generated event that would occur in the future. We also 
looked at the people's left-brain/right-brain hemisphere domi- 
nance pattern, as measured by the psychological questionnaire. 
The second task was to have people describe a distant place. They 
had no knowledge about the place selected at any given time. This 
kind of test is called remote viewing." 

Journey to the Unknown. Remote viewing is one of the most 
common experiments in psychic research. Mobius's studies with 
remote viewing involve respondents describing locations in pic- 
tures being viewed by a researcher, or describing a location to 
which a researcher has gone. The destination's name is one of 
many put in sealed envelopes with numbers assigned. The re- 
searcher selects one based on a random number generated by the 
Apple. Thus, the destination is known only to the researcher, and 
only when he is already en route. 

Mobius is evaluating the data from its Psi Q experiments as 
part of a consortium of labs, including Princeton and SRI Interna- 
tional. "We've changed our position a little about the distribution 
of ability in the population at large," De Mattel admits. "We've 
always held the idea that everybody's psychic. We expected it to 
turn up readily, but there's been more resistance. It's there, 
distributed much like any other talent." 

"With Psi Q one and two," Schwartz notes, "there's just no 
way you could conduct such an experiment— twenty-three thou- 
sand cases, each of which has fifty-six questions, each question 
having three to five possibilities— without computers. In parapsy- 
chology, computers really have made a difference in the ability to 
look at phenomena and process large amounts of data. They not 
only give us interesting ways of developing experiments, but also 
the ability to see small factors and patterns emerge out of large, 
apparently amorphous bodies of information." 

In parapsychology. Apples are widely used for the informa- 
tion age equivalent of card-calling, the traditional form of ESP 
experiment— used forty years ago at Duke University by J.B. 
Rhine, the man who coined the term "extrasensory perception." 
In card-calling, the subject must divine a number or symbol on an 
unseen flash card. With the Apple, it's done with random number 
generation and a monitor. (See "In Search of the Sixth Sense," 
Softalk, June 1983.) 

Making use of the Apple's built-in (if somewhat crude) ran- 
dom number-generating ability, De Mattel, in 1981, programmed 
a guessing game in which you attempt to predict the next random 
number that the computer will generate. Two "hits" out of ten 
tries scores as chance; three or more is a positive indication of 
precognition. The game proceeds through a series of 100 trials 
and an evaluation tells you how well you did. Mobius consultant 
Alan Vaughan is currently perfecting a more dynamic version. 

"The problem with card-calling," says Vaughan, "is that the 
more people do it, the worse they get. A lot of parapsychologists 
have stopped using it because they get such dismal results. They 
haven't been able to really pin down why people always show this 
decline effect, but it's been characteristic of all ESP forced- 
choice testing so far." 

After five years of research, Vaughan, former editor of 
Psychic magazine, has developed an Apple II game called 
Psychic Defender, an improved, alternative ESP experiment for 
the computer age. 

Texas Psych-,Out. Mobius is currently conducting formal 
testing of Psychic Defender and expects to have the whole 
package ready this month for the Dallas convention of the Para- 
psychological Association, a group of about three hundred inter- 
national scientists who investigate ESP phenomena. Vaughan is 
the only one of the association's scientists who also works pro- 
fessionally as a psychic. 

"I think that's why this design works, because I designed it 




115 



from the psychic's point of view rather than from the scientist's 
point of view. It's a precognition test in game format with four 
levels. Each level is a wheel. Level 1 has six segments, level 2 
has ten segments, level 3 has fourteen, and level 4 has eighteen. 
The idea is to predict which one of those sectors is going to be 
selected by a random number program— the one we're using now 
is the peek system in the Apple II, so it's a real-time random 
generator, depending on which billionth of a second you hit a 
key. 

"You score so many points for a direct hit, but if you hit 
anywhere in the target half of the wheel, you get points. If you hit 
in the nontarget half of the wheel, you lose a man. Scores are 
recorded automatically and printed out." Vaughan explains that 
tests done so far indicate that out of 100,000 tries, 225 hits would 
occur by pure chance. "The really interesting thing about this is 
that people seem to show a learning effect; the more they play it, 
the better they get." 

In the course of designing the game, Vaughan noticed an ESP 
example of the close-but-no-cigar phenomenon. Starting with 
roulette experiments, he discovered that there was a tendency to 
get the previous number in serial order to the actual target. In 
other words, if the target was a 3, Vaughan would tend to come 
up with a 2. 

He decided to dispense with numbers altogether. Psychic De- 
fender'?, wheel has no numbers; the subject must sense which sec- 
tor of the circle is going to be chosen by chance as the target. This 
method calls upon the intuitive rather than the logical function of 
the brain. 

Psychic Marketplace. Vaughan and Mobius plan to market 
the game in a redesigned format with improved graphics and to 
have it translated for several other computer systems— after they 
get experimental results in. It may be offered as an intuition 
trainer, which was Vaughan 's initial concept of the game. 

"Precognition is the most important form of intuition," he 
says. ' 'We hope by November to have this available with a manu- 
al and training tapes. The computer part will just be one aspect of 
it. The point is to train people to recognize the internal signals 
that accompany accurate predictions. The next step is to transfer 
that learning into your daily life, whether you're trying to predict 
which stocks are going up and which are going down or whatever 
kind of decision you have to make. 

"We hope to show that anybody can do it and get good 
results. We're currently using nine respondents, and I'm sending 
the disk to other laboratories so they can repeat the experiment. 
We'll see what the tests indicate before we make any grand pro- 
nouncements," says Vaughan. 

Perhaps the primary benefit of the Apple for Mobius has been 
the freedom it gives parapsychologists, working in the most 
sparsely populated and underftinded of academic areas, to enlarge 
the scale of their experiments. De Mattel notes that "a lot of re- 
search in universities is done on really small groups— grad stu- 
dent classes of twenty to forty people. A lot of the suppositions 
made are based on the projections from these small experiments. 
While they may be neat, tidy little models based on a class of for- 
ty middle-class students, when you pump that up to the general 
population and pour several thousand people through the model, 
it starts to creak and groan and grow holes. It's only with the 
computer that we're able to expand these models to a larger for- 
mat so that they might make sense within the general popula- 
tion." 

Community of Minds. For such experiments, Mobius works 
with nonprofessional psychics. "A lot of these people had never 
really tried this before they began to work with us," says 
Schwartz. "Our predisposition is not to work with people who 
are professional psychics; they have a lot on the line. Our method 
is designed to take the pressure off of any one person and to

transfer it onto the group. It's a team methodology, like a group 
of computers hooked up in parallel. 

"The Mobius approach to research is essentially to create a 
kind of supermind in which a team of respondents participates. 
For the model, the respondents are the intuitive half of the project 
and scientists are the analytical half. It's a team because this is not 
something that one discipline can study. Parapsychology alone is 
inadequate to really get a handle on what psychic functioning is. 
You have to put together a team, as we do in every project, of an 
interdisciplinary group of researchers, each of whom is highly 
skilled in one part of the puzzle." 

When Mobius mounted a psychic archaeology project in 
Alexandria, Egypt, the expedition consisted of archaeologists, 
geologists, electrical engineers, hydrographers, oceanographers, 
historians, and psychics. "What you want are people who are on 
the cutting edge of their specialty," says Schwartz. "When we 
select people to be involved with the teams, we go through the 
literature and recruit the best people available based on peer 
evaluation. 

"People always ask us whether we run into a lot of controver- 
sy and skepticism. The answer is no. When you ask people to be 
in an exciting project, and to participate in their discipline, they 
don't have to go out on a limb on something they don't know 
much about. They very rarely say no. We find this to be true with 
the creative geniuses, the leaders in their field, not the followers. 
They are quite open and interested, fascinated to participate in 
these experiments." 

While Mobius has a central full-time staff, its entity changes 
with each project, says De Mattel, and it becomes "this larger 
mass of people who are the scientists and the respondents." 

Challengers of the Unknown. And yet, it seems the research 
hasn't brought us any closer to a definition or understanding of 



psychic phenomena. Schwartz admits this. 

"Our field is about where the nineteenth-century explorers of 
Africa were when they were coming back to talk about elephants. 
You're seeing a very early stage of a developing science. It's 
been around a hundred years, and it's only had a statistical model- 
ing ability for about fifty years. Just over a hundred years ago, 
doctors were sharpening their scalpels on the soles of their boots 
before going in to operate. 

"It wouldn't upset me," says Schwartz, "if psychic function- 
ing turned out to be some explainable process that doesn't require 
an extension of present theory. We just want to go over the data 
without any biases. People develop enormous biases about infor- 
mation, and that information becomes invisible. They just won't 
look at it because it doesn't fit their preconception of what ought 
to be going on. 

"Paranoia about being picked on by others has had a very 
fruitful result in parapsychology. It has forced us to develop very 
rigorous protocols. The strictest policing of potential fraud or bad 
methodology comes from other parapsychologists. I don't know 
of another field in science that is as rigorously policed by its own 
membership. Parapsychologists, more than anybody else, are 
concerned with misuse of information, or falsification of infor- 
mation, and with badly constructed experiments that produce im- 
p)erfectly understood results." 

Digging Deeper. Psychic phenomena has managed to make 
some gains in respectability over the last hundred years. Archae- 
ology is currentiy the one traditional, reputable academic field in 
which it has made at least a small dent. 

For Mobius's first major field operation. Deep Quest, an ex- 
periment in deep-ocean psychic archaeology, five psychics using 
a sea chart covering an area of fifteen square miles independentiy 
pinpointed the predicted site of a shipwreck in an area of 180

square yards off the shores of Santa Catalina Island. 

The experiment was conducted using the triple-blind protocol. 
The challenge was to find a sunken ship, whose precise 
whereabouts were unknown, in waters that were too deep for 
divers. 

As De Mattel explains the curious results, "The wreck was 
described by the respondents as a wooden ship, steam- and wind- 
powered, sunk by an explosion amidships. One respondent also 
described a large, enigmatic block— a huge cube— saying that it 
may have been part of the cargo. That didn't make any sense to 
anybody." 

Using a submarine provided by the Institute for Marine and 
Coastal Studies of the University of Southern California, the 
Mobius researchers first found a tie bar from a ship's hull in the 
target area— by itself not conclusive evidence of a wreck. They 
kept going and found a massive winch. "And you don't lose a 
marine winch over the side of a boat," De Mattel points out. 

After locating the hull and additional remains of the predicted 
wreck, the last thing the researchers found was a large, rec- 
tangular concrete block. No one could say what it was for or what 
it was doing there. 

"It was one of those elegant hits," recalls De Mattel, "not 
something you'd guess in advance or just associate with a sunken 
ship." 

Independent analysis by researchers from the Bureau of Land 
Management, Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, and the Cana- 
dian deep-ocean engineering firm of Hyco confirmed the critical 
elements of the psychics' reconstruction: the ship's age, the fact 
that the site had been previously unknown, and the cause of the 
ship's sinking. 

With the nationally publicized success of Deep Quest, Mobius 
was able to apply for grants and foundation money needed to 



mount more ambitious fieldwork. In 1979, they were able to send 
to Egypt a team of psychics and scientists that psychically pin- 
pointed a Byzantine structure in the buried city of Marea— an an- 
cient settlement now under the Egyptian desert— in a location 
where archaelogists and an electronic survey assured them that 
nothing would be found. In the harbor of Alexandria, under- 
water, the team found the ruins of the long-lost lighthouse of Pha- 
ros, one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. They also 
found a temple of Isis Pharia, the palace where Mark Antony 
committed suicide, and the location of the city's original sea 
wall— allowing archaeologists to redraw the maps of the probable 
orientation of the ancient city. 

Psychic Defenders. It's been a long, hard struggle, and the 
history of the acceptance of the psychic even among a handftil of 
practitioners of archaeology (academically, an underdog 
discipline among the sciences) is littered with broken careers. 

Still, in 1973, J. Norman Emerson, "the father of Canadian 
archaeology, ' ' addressed the subject at a meeting of the Canadian 
Archaeological Association. He said, "It is my conviction that I 
have received knowledge about archaeological sites from a 
psychic informant who relates this information to me without any 
evidence of the conscious use of reasoning. By means of the intui- 
tive and parapsychological, a whole new vista of man and his past 
stands ready to be grasped. As an anthropologist and as an ar- 
chaeologist trained in these fields, it makes sense to me to seize 
the opportunity to pursue and study the data thus provided." 

This endorsement took considerable courage to make, and 
probably only a man in Emerson's unassailable position would 
have dared to do it. With such recognition, and with the now ines- 
capable conclusion that psychic ability can work as a useful re- 
search tool— with a little help from a faithful computer— the wild 
frontier of pyschic research is being tamed.

Softalk Presents Hie Bestsellers 



Win Some . . . Lose Some 



Whenever a successful software author writes a new package that's 
close to his previous offerings, there's the question of whether the new 
effort will increase interest in the older package or kill it. 

It can work either way, as the results of June sales indicate so 
clearly. 

The big loser appears also to be the biggest winner— Rupert Lissner, 
author of Quick File He and AppleWorks. AppleWorks has become the 
biggest seller by far in the Apple market and appears set to remain that 
way for a long time to come. The program most impacted by its intro- 
duction was Quick File He. 

Quick File He had consistently rated high in the Top Thirty since its 
introduction until AppleWorks came along. In June, it disappeared from 
those ranks and dropped to the bottom rung of the Business 10. Its days 
seem to be clearly numbered. 

In contrast, Silas Warner of Muse brought out Beyond Castle Wolfen- 
stein, a sequel to his previous bestseller. For the most part. Castle Wolf- 
enstein had been out of the Top Thirty but had remained strong in the 
Strategy 5 category. It would be not at all illogical to assume that the new 
Warner offering would sound the death knell for the old. 

Quite the opposite happened. While Beyond Castle Wolfenstein was 
climbing into sixth position in the Top Thirty, it was fueling renewed in- 
terest in Castle Wolfenstein. That program made it to twenty-seventh on 
the Top Thirty, its first appearance there since the end of last year's holi- 
day selling period. 

Likewise, the introduction of Sorcerer by Infocom generated addi- 
tional interest in Enchanter, the first in the projected trilogy. Enchanter 
rose to score twenty-eighth, while Sorcerer dug in at thirtieth on the list. 

Sometimes, even what appears to be a directly competitive product 
from the same company will help an older product out. VisiCorp scored 
big in its first month with FlashCalc, a spreadsheet product aimed at the 
He market. An unexpected beneficiary of the interest in FlashCalc was 
VisiCalc, which tied with Sorcerer for thirtieth after several months off

Beneath Apple ProDOS 

A Technical Manual 



Beneath Apple ProDOS 




Beneath Apple ProDOs 



By Don Worth and Pieter Lechner 



TSOFTWaRg 



This book serves as a companion to the ProDOS 
manuals provided by Apple Computer, Inc. It provides 
additional information for the advanced programmer or 
even for the novice Apple user who wants to know more 
about his disk operating system. 

Readers of our earlier book, Beneath Apple DOS. will 
notice that we have retained the basic organization of that 
book, which has been widely praised for its clear 
organization and attention to detail. 

Includes information on . . . 

• How to access ProDOS and/or the Apple floppy 
drives directly from machine language 

• How to fix damaged diskettes 

• Errors and omissions in Apple's documentation 

• Customizing ProDOS to fit your needs 

• How diskettes are formatted 

• The internal logic of ProDOS 

Beneath Apple ProDOS presents a critical, non-Apple 
perspective of ProDOS. This book explains how an 
operating system works and provides many examples of 
ProDOS programming.

from State of the Art, and Catalyst from Quark. Other than Brock's Key- 
stroke database, no other Apple III product made a significant dent in the 
market. 

The top half of the Arcade 10 stayed the same, but there were radical 
revisions in the bottom half. Arcade Boot Camp from Penguin jumped to 
sixth in its first full month in distribution. Atarisoft scored the next two 
positions with Jungle Hunt and Ms. Pac-Man. Hard Hat Mack clung to 
ninth, followed by two other newcomers to the list: Dino Eggs and Sam- 
my Lightfoot. 

On the word processing list, the rule was shuffle rather than change. 
The only new entry was Format-II, which is often on the list but hadn't 
made it in May. Bank Street Writer, Apple Writer lie, and PFS: Write 
continue to dominate the category . 

Four new programs made the Education 10, although it was the first 
time for only one of them. Rejoining the list were Early Games: Piece of 
Cake, Math Blaster, and Type Attack. Making the list for the first time 
was Win with Words I, gaining eighth place. 

The Adventure 5 list remained the domain of Infocom, with four of 
the five programs coming from that company. For what seems like the 
umpty-umpth time, it was Death in the Caribbean that prevented Info- 
com from making a clean sweep of the category. 

The only change in the Strategy 5 list was the return of Millionaire to 
the chart after a one-month absence. Castle Wolfenstein and Sargon III 
changed places. 

There were no new additions to the Fantasy 5 list, where Sir-tech has 
three entries and Lord British has the other two. Legacy of Llylgamyn's 
strength pushed three of the programs down a notch. 

FlashCalc was one of two new entries on the Business 10. It edged 
out Multiplan for fourth, making it the highest-placed spreadsheet prod- 
uct. The other new entry was Versaform, enjoying a renaissance of pop- 
ularity after several months off the chart. 

The Utility 10 category got the biggest shakeup. ProDOS User's Kit 
from Apple jumped into first. Graphics Magician held second, but Fon- 
trix rejoined the list in third. Zoom Grafix dropped from first to fourth, 
Frame-Up rejoined the chart in fifth, and Apple Mechanic dropped one 
position to sixth. 

The Complete Graphics System, after several months off the list, 
vaulted into seventh. Global Program Line Editor dropped to eighth. Ap- 
ple's ProDOS Assembler scored ninth, and two Beagle Bros products— 
Pronto DOS and DOS Boss— tied for tenth after being off the list last 
month. 

The Home 10 category got shuffled at the top. Home Accountant re- 
gained the lead, a position it had previously held for twenty-seven con- 
secutive months before being bumped last month. Dollars and Sense 
climbed into second, while newcomer Print Shop jumped to third. 

Music Construction Set, the giant killer that bumped off Home Ac- 
countant last month, trailed off to fourth. 

Sales were generally higher in June than in May. The biggest 
beneficiaries of the activity were products in the Home and Adventure 

Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 5.06 percent of all 
sales of Apple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in July to ascertain their sales for the month 
of June. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold— such 
other criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and per- 
sonal preferences of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in July represented every geographical area of the continental 
United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the in- 
dex number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index 
number is an arbitrary measure of the relative strength of the programs listed. In- 
dex numbers are correlative only to the month in which they are printed; readers 
cannot assume that an index rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales 
to an index rating of 50 in another month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 2.51 percent, which translates 
roughly into the theoretical possibility of a change of 2.78 points, plus or minus, 
in any index numh)er. 



categories. For the second consecutive month, sales of educational soft- 
ware suffered more than any other market segment. H
