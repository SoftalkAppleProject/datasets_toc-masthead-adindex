Many people think just because a computer does 
difficult things, it must be difficult to operate. Not so. 
At least not with PFS and PFS: REPORT. 

PFS and PFS: REPORT let you concentrate on 
doing your work, not on working your computer. There's 
no complicated programming or computer language to 
leam. Using the PFS Series is so straightforward, you 
can leam it in as little as 20 minutes, and that's some- 
thing both experts and beginners can appreciate. 

Design your own management system, simply. 

PES lets you arrange your information in "forms" 
you design yourself. Once you've created your form— 
with spaces for all the necessary data— you simply fill 
in the blanks. 

If you don't like the original form, PFS lets you 
change just the form, without having to totally re-enter 
the information on it. 

To use your forms, just call up the information 
you want in a variety of ways such 
as "less thani' "more than," "equal 
to," "between" or "not." You can 
even find specific charac- 
ters, words, names or num- 



40-column format to accommodate larger printouts, 
and tell you how much room you have left on your disk. 
Get more out of what you put in. 

PFS: REPORT sorts, calculates, totals, formats 
and prints presentation-qualify reports with up to 9 col- 
umns, in alpha or numeric order, with automatic 
entering and justification. With your information in 
this format, you can analyze it quickly to help spot 
trends, plan and make decisions. 

A whole family of software for Apple® II and III. 

PFS consistently ranks among the 5 top-selling 
business software packages for Apples. Because you 
can use it for almost anything— from chemical analyses 
to keeping track of your wine collection, from bal- 
ancing your checkbook to computing your payroll. 
And there are more programs on the way. 

For a free, hands-on demonstration of PFS and 
PFS: REPORT, stop by your local computer store. If

Last month we brought you the ori- 
gins of some of those apparently off-the- 
wall names that companies give them- 
selves and their products, but one name 
was suspiciously missing. Apple! What 
the heck is this magazine all about, 
anyway? 

How anyone can use an Apple and not 
wonder where the name came from is be- 
yond us. This month's contest invites you 
to provide an answer. Quite simply, tell 
us your version of how the Apple got its 
name. 

If you've read articles about the Ap- 
ple or its creators in other newspapers, 
magazines, or journals, you probably 
have an idea of how Woz and Jobs de- 
cided on such a whimsical name for such 
a fanciful creation. Forget them. We're 
not interested in truth for this contest ; we 
want to see how creative you can be. 

For those of you with a creative flair 
who missed out on last November's Art 
Gallery contest because: (a) you weren't 
a Softalk reader back then, (b) you can't 
draw, or (c) you thought HGR meant 
"handy game routines," here's your 
chance to shine. 

And we do mean shine. Really let 
yourself go! If you're good with rhymes, 
you might write your answer in a poem, a 
song (include sheet music, if you like), a 
limerick, or a sonnet done in iambic pen- 
tameter. Monologues, dialogues, essays, 
and dramatic scenarios are equally ac- 
ceptable. Whatever form you decide on, 
decide fast, because September 15 is 
coming up soon, and that's when all en- 



tries must be in the mail. 

This month the random number gen- 
erator gets a rest; Softalk's contest staff 
will judge all entries and come up with 
one winner. Entries will be judged on 
imagination and creativity. (In the case 
of a tie, the contest staff will fight it out.) 

The winner will receive $100 worth of 
goods from Softalk advertisers, to be col- 
lected at the winner's local computer 
store. 

Entries must be at least twenty-five 
words long, but not longer than two dou- 
ble-spaced pages. If you can't type (via 
printer or typewriter), then print neatly. 
Verrry neatly. We can't be responsible if 
we can't read your writing. 

Sound like fun? You bet. So get those 
creative juices flowing, and send us your 
fantasy version of why your computer 
isn't a Kumquat n Plus. 

All entries must be postmarked by 
midnight, September 15, 1982.

1st Class Main 
It does everything 
but lick the stamp. 




We've made a mailing list program worthy of today's 
remarkable microcomputers. It's called 1st Chss 
Mail™ — but you can use it for anything you'd keep 
on a card file, like your car's servicing history or 
your address book. And it's not only the most flexible 
mail list/ utility data base you can buy — it's also 
incredibly easy to use. 

You create the label. 

Since you're not stuck with the same old name/ 
company/ street/ etc. format, you can make the label 
look like what- 
ever you want. 
And with the 
new feature that 
lets you print right on your ' 
envelopes, you not only 

save time — you give your correspondence a very 
professional look. 

Super search and sort. 

1st Class Mail™ lets you search and sort in any of 
12 different categories. So you can organize your 
mailings by zip code 
(up to 10 digits), alpha- 
betical order, state, 
company, any way 
you want. Fast. 
And if you're using 
1st Class Mail™ loT 
another type of data 
base , like a record 

collection, you can sort by whatever categories you 
choose — from String Quartets to Rhythym and 
Blues. It's extremely flexible. 




1ST CLASS nnlL • 
"DRM LETTEF TEST 
PRINTED LHEiEL FORMAT 



Personalized entries. 

One of the ways we've made 
1st Class Mail™ especially "user 
friendly" is by letting you 
create your own headings for 
each entry line. So your 
computer speaks your language. 




The form letter feature. 

1st Class Mail™ is compatible with 
many word processors, such as 
Screenwriter II™ Applewriter II ^ 
Applewriter III™ Pie Writer,™ 
and WordStar /Mailmerge™ 
Just a few simple commands and 
you can combine your form 
letters with your mailing list for pro- 
^\ fessionally formatted documents. 
j All automatically. 




Automatic entry. 

If time is money, this feature 
translates minutes directly into 
dollars. It automatically includes, 
or searches for, particular categories^ 
in each entry you record. Repetitive 
typing and sorting becomes a push-button joy. 

The special message line. 

Now you can put a special message anywhere on the 
label — in a choice of type 
styles. Whether you're 
saying ATTENTION: 
SALES MAN- 
AGER or MERRY' 
CHRISTMAS! you 
can do it automat- 
ically. And right on the envelope. 

Stop by your Continental Software dealer. Or call us 
today to find out all about 1st Class Mail™ No matter 
what you're cataloging, from a household inventory 
for insurance purposes to a 25,000 person mailing 
list, 1st Class Mail™ is the best program you can buy. 

It's true, you still have to lick the stamp. 

But we're working on it.

Contest Winners: 

Trivia Trump 

Wins 
Second Drive 



The First Great AppleTrivia Contest. 

We have a winner! Carl Webb of Vista, 
California, is now a two-drive man. Webb 
responded correctly to thirty-three of the 
fifty "devilishly hard" trivia questions to 
win the March contest. On a straight 
curve, that's a D-l- , and in this case the D 
stands for "disk drive." 

"The fiendish contest drove me out of 
my mind for months," Webb wrote on his 
entry. But Webb will be the one doing the 
driving from now on with his new Apple 
disk drive. 

Ken Karleskint from San Luis Obis- 
po, California, was Trivia's runner-up, 
and he will receive $50 worth of goods by 
Sof talk's advertisers. Karleskint was not 
far behind the winner, having answered 
twenty-seven questions correctly. 

The third, fourth, and fifth place win- 
ners were Harvest Collier, Midland, 
Michigan; Joseph C. Gamer, Black- 
duck, Minnesota; and Judson Cohan, Los 
Angeles, California. They each will re- 
ceive an extra year's free subscription to 
Softalk.

Dig the Decades. Brian Crowley of 
Hawthorne, California, correctly identi- 
fied all fifty-five caricatures from the 
"Fritz the Cat" story to win the May con- 
test. Of the twenty perfect entries that 
were run through the random number 
generator, Crowley's surfaced as the 
winner. 

Crowley will receive $100 worth of 
goods through his local dealer. Value 
Sales of Lawndale, California. His shop- 
ping list includes Verbatim disks and the 
Epson graphics chip. Crowley says he 
worked for about five hours on the con- 
test and had to search through old copies 
of Softalk to identify the Apple personali- 
ties. 

Many entries fell just one short of be- 
ing perfect. Shame on those of you who 
failed to identify number fifty-five! In 
case you're still wondering about the 
identities of the caricatures, here they

INTRODUCING 
MKROBUFFER. 



NOW YOU CAN USE YOUR PRINTER 
WITHOUT WASTING COMPUTER TIME. 



As you know, your computer 
drives your printer. And when it's 
performing this function, you 
can't use it for anything else. 

A program that takes fifteen 
minutes to print makes you wait 
fifteen minutes before you can 
compute again. And if it takes 
two hours to print, you wait two 
hours. 

A waste of valuable time. 

THE NEW MKROBUFFER"

MICROBUFFER 
ACaPTSPRINnNGDATA 

AS FAST AS YOUR 
COMPUnRCANSENDIT. 

Microbuffer first stores the data 
in its own memory buffer and 
then takes control of your printer. 
This frees the computer for more 
productive functions. 

Additional output may be 
dumped to the buffer at any time 
and it will be printed in turn.

Now, Microsoft MULTIPLAN 

toughest questions 



Better tools. If you're answering "What 
if. . ." questions with a pencil, eraser, 
calculator and endless manhours, 
Multiplan gives you a better set of tools. 

Fast answers. Multiplan is a software 
program that turns a microcomputer 
into an answer machine. Multiplan 
starts as an open "worksheet" of rows 
and columns. Each intersection of row and 
column, or "cell;' in the worksheet will accept titles, 
names, numbers or formulas. As you assign names or 
values to cells, you build a worksheet for a particular 
problem or set of problems. You establish the logic. Multiplan 
assigns the time-consuming calculations to the computer 
Which means you get answers. Fast. 

Simpler, faster, more powerful. 

Multiplan is a com- 
pletely interactive 
electronic work- 
sheet. Change one 
number or formula, 
and you change 
every number that 





depends on it. Instantly. Furthermore, Multiplan is several 
worksheets deep. You can pass information from sheet to 
sheet automatically. A change on your cash and receiv- 
ables sheet is reflected on your balance sheet, for instance. 

Computing for non-computer people. 

You can use Multiplan on a reasonably 
priced personal computer. . . even if 
you've never used a computer before. 
Plain English "prompts" direct you 
through each step. If you need 
additional help, just press the "?" 
key Information that addresses your specific question will 
appear on the screen. Get your answer and return to the 
problem. Without leafing through a manual. 

Logical problem solving. Multiplan allows you to assign 
English names to represent one or more cells on the 
worksheet. That way you can refer to items the way you 
think of them. Profit equals "Sales minus Expenses" for 
instance. Instead of "L14 minus M17." 

Watch whafs happening. The computer screen displays 
a portion of a giant worksheet that's 63 columns wide by 
255 rows deep. In addition, you can open multiple "windows" 
to other areas of the worksheet. That capability allows you 



Fast answers to some of the 
in business. 



to watch what the effect of changing a number or formula 
in one area will be on other areas of the worksheet. How 
a change in sales will effect the botto 
line, for instance. It's a particularly 
valuable feature when you're 
solving "What if . . ." problems. 

When time is money. For man- , 
agers and professionals, time 
is the most valuable asset. Thinking 
time. That's the concept behind 
Multiplan. By assigning the time- 
consuming aspects of planning, 
forecasting, interpreting, recording I 
and reworking data to the 
computer, Multiplan gives you time 
to think. Result: Not only faster 
answers . . . better answers. 

Apple II® or CP/M-SOf Multiplan is available for the 
Apple II Personal Computer (in 40 and 80 column versions), 
and microcomputers utilizing the CP/M-80 operating system.

why does 

EDU-WVRE bother 

to meet 
mcUvidual 
needs? 




Have you ever met an 
"average" learner? The 
reality is that every learner 
brings to the curriculum at 
hand a distinct combination 
of skills — at any age, in 
home or classroom. Given 
the reality, solutions to 
learning needs must 
somehow focus on the 
individual. 

Edu-Ware focuses on the 
needs of the individual 
learner. Use its Computer 
Based Instruction (CBI) to 
achieve specific learning 
objectives: 

Accelerate — Gifted 
students need 
opportunities to advance 
beyond their classmates. 
Edu-Ware helps them 
follow their own pace and 
ensures continuing 
motivation. 

Remediate — Deficiencies 
in core skills sometimes 
limit a learner's success 
in an entire subject. 
Edu-Ware can be 
fine-tuned to the 



individual's abilities in 
distinct skill areas; give the 
right feedback at the right 
time; alleviate frustration. 

Reinforce — Learners 
sometimes run into hurdles 
in their work which they 
need help to bridge. For 
them Edu-Ware's benefits 
are 1) precise definition 
of skills taught in each 
system and 2) a patient, 
non-threatening approach. 

Refresh — At one time or 
another, nearly everyone 
wants to brush up on skills. 
Edu-Ware offers adults 
and young learners alike 
an effective way to review. 
Edu-Ware helps solve 
learnin g needs each step of 
the wa y . . . because some 
learners require a helping 
(animated) hand or carefully 
monitored instruction, while 
others are prepared to 
manage their own learning. 

For young learners, 
ARITHMETIC SKILLS™ uses 
high resolution displays and 
minimum text to establish 
basic math skills — addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, 
and division. 




EDU-WARE. Because solution means more than keeping them busy. 



The Learning Manager 
Systems in FRACTIONS and 
DECIMALS let specific 
parameters (i.e. number or 
subject of test problems, 
sequence, sound effects) be 
tailored to the individual. 

The ALGEBRA SERIES, 
a sequence of five 
independent packages, 
together comprise a 
first-year algebra course. Its 
learners have already 
acquired basic math skills. 
Selecting to work in one or 
more "learning styles," each 
individual is encouraged to 
achieve an increased level 
of self-management. 

Edu-Ware can make the 
difference in Lan g ua g e Arts. 
Often that difference means 
adaptability to a wide range 
of learners. 

Teachers participating in 
an MECC evaluation of 
COMPU-READ reported: 
"Students liked the 
programs . . . they really had 
to concentrate. It was 
surprising how even the 
youngest children stayed on 
task."* COMPU-READ is a 
tool for improving reading 
speed and recall because it 
works with the reader (child 
through adult), matching 
pace to performance. 

COMPU-SPELL teaches 
spelling by positive 
reinforcement. With 
Data Levels 4-8 it will 
accommodate up to sixty 
learners, yet gives each 
individual vocabulary suited 
to his or her needs. 
COMPU-SPELL with the 



Adult/Secretarial level 
becomes a tool for 
mastering words common in 
business, industry, and 
college. 

Edu-Ware hel ps you to 
prepare , whether for the 
college board or the 
business world. 

Word attack skills are 
tools of analysis which give 
you an edge on mastering 
vocabulary, deciphering 
new or unfamiliar words, 
and taking tests. SAT and 
PSAT** WORD ATTACK 
SKILLS are tutorials which 
give college-bound students 
that edge. 

New tools called 
I nteractive Simulations™ — 
Demonstration aids 
learning, especially in 
subjects like Earth Science 
and Physics. 

RENDEZVOUS accurately 
simulates, in 3-D animation, 
the orbital flight of a space 
shuttle craft. It will 
demonstrate exact systems 
of ballistics and orbital 
mechanics or the 
disorienting effects of 
inertial space. Use it to test 
the limits of learners' (over 
13) physics understanding, 
mathematical judgment, 
and perceptual skill. 

Learning companions for 
the ver y youn g. Children 3-6 
are taking their first steps 
toward "computer literacy." 
With animation and 
easy-to-read, high 
resolution graphics, 
Edu-Ware's "BEEs" make 
learning comfortable and 



fun without forfeiting 
carefully managed 
instruction. 

Children work intently 
with SPELLING BEE AND 
READING PRIMER, 
discovering basic concepts 
about words, spelling, 
and reading. Capturing 
attention, COUNTING BEE 
introduces young learners 
to numbers. 

Walk into your local 
computer dealership and 



ask for a demonstration 
of Edu-Ware. You'll see 
the difference.

A Eulogy for the Ace 

Jonathan Livingston Seagull is dead. I 
know. I went to his funeral. He died a 
year or two before the first Apples ripened 
in the fertile minds of Jobs and Woz. 
They buried him on flat ground, a few 
miles from here, a very long way from 
the sea. 

There really was a Jonathan Living- 
ston who flew away to glory beyond the 
doubts and reproaches of his straight- 
laced hometown. That he chose flight 
was a mere accident of being bom at the 
same time as airplanes. He would have 
done something. 

Jonathan was from Cedar Falls, 
Iowa. He longed to fly and found his way 
into the cockpit at an early age. I never 
did get the full story of how it was, though 

1 think Richard Bach probably came 
pretty close to the truth. 

Jonathan was an ace in World War I, 
back when that made people proud to 
know you. He flew mail. He barn- 
stormed. He did everything you had to do 
in those days to stay in the air. He 
devoted his life to the advancement of 
aviation. The last two true stories that 
can be told about him are these: 

A friend had recently bought an aero- 
batic biplane. He had flown it to Florida, 
where Jonathan Livingston lived, and 
asked the 70-plus-year-old veteran ace to 
test fly it. Jonathan put the plane through 
its paces in a dizzying hour of loops, rolls, 
spins, dives, and soaring climbs. He test- 
ed it the only way he knew: push it be- 
yond the limits and see if it still holds to- 
gether. That's how you learned what 
something could do. Know it beyond what 
the landlocked safety-crabs would al-

low. Back on the ground, he climbed 
from the cockpit. 

"It's a fine plane," he told the happy 
new owner. And then he fell dead on the 
tarmac of the airport ramp, beneath the 
still-warm strut of the plane that had 
carried him on his last flight. That's a 
true story. 

The other story is that many of his 
friends from young manhood were not at 
the preacher's part of the funeral, which 
happened at the Dahl Van Hoof Schoof 
Funeral Home back in Cedar Falls, 
Iowa. They did not come to walk by his 
coffin inside a building; to look at his 
peaceful, frozen face; to listen to mur- 
mured platitudes made loud by stilled 
room air. They were all out at the air- 
port, warming up their biplanes. The en- 
tire time the coffin remained above 
ground at the cemetery, they flew, one by 
one, low, loud, fast through the tugging 
wind, catching their friend's drift, and 
whirling it with them on and up behind a 
cloud, then wheeling and diving again. 
They maintained no formal configur- 
ation that the eye could see. The Ancient 
Birdmen, as they call themselves still, 
knew that no map was needed nor appro- 
priate to follow Jonathan's free course 
that day. 

His leather flying suit, boots, and 
wooden propeller stand in a glass case at 
the Waterloo, Iowa, airport, which was 
recently renamed Livingston Field. The 
business flyers who get bored waiting for 
their jet to Chicago or Dallas sometimes 
wander over to look at what is left of him. 
They usually look uncomfortable, as if 
they don't know what to do with their 
hands. They usually don't look too long. 

Softalk, when it is at its best, pushes 
young Jonathan Livingston program- 
mers from their safe nests, to take the 
risks and devote the time to make to- 
day's infernal, infant, dangerous-in-their- 
own-way computers part of the boring 
world that the shore birds demand, lest 
they feel unsafe. Jonathan Livingston, 
his flying togs stuffed and mounted in a 
glass case at an airport that bears his 
name in the middle of the prairie, would 
understand. He would approve. 
David G. Sparks, Waterloo, lA 



A Twisted Solution 

Still plagued by the tear-away covers of

answer. Simply turn the magazine in- 
side out. The paper for those On-Line 
ads is really top quality!

Slippery Disks and Suntan Lotion 

I am a Navy submarine radioman and 
electronics instructor with a mind that 
tends to understand both the operational 
and technical side of things. I bought my 
Apple a year ago and started my own 
business as a writer and photographer. 
No one had to tell me twice to back up my 
disks. Nonetheless, tragedy struck. 

In a recent move, the box containing 
my disks (originals and backups) fell out 
of the truck, onto the freeway, and was 
run over. My disks were scattered by 
passing cars. It looked sort of like a dust 
storm. To make matters worse I had 
packed other household items in the 
same box including several tubes of sun- 
tan lotion. We stopped and gathered as 
many of the disks as we could find. Many 
of them were covered with suntan lotion. 
I figured the data on the disks was as lost 
as my voice by then. I tossed all the disks 
into a plastic bag and we finished the job 
of moving. 

Two days later I finally felt calm 
enough to investigate the damage. To my 
surprise the disks without suntan lotion 
on them verified. I quickly transferred 
their files to new disks, but there was no 
way I was going to stick any of the sun- 
tan lotion coated disks into my precious 
drives. The following weekend, a friend 
(who knew nothing at all about com- 
puters) suggested I try cleaning them 
with cotton swabs and alcohol. I tried it, 
sUpped the disk into the drive, and held 
my breath. 

It worked! I wrote Verbatim and 
heaped the praise high. Paul Moriconi 
wrote back to make sure I had made du- 
plicate copies of the alcohol treated disks, 
because the alcohol can have an adverse 
effect on the magnetic coating, causing it 
to come off onto the drive heads. Some 
friends of his in marketing read my letter 
and sent two free boxes of disks to help 
defray the expense of all the duplicates. 

I'm not the only one who has had good 
experiences with Verbatim disks. At one 
of the Honolulu Apple Users Society's 
(HAUS) last meetings, our president 



Protection for the Apple II

asked if anybody in the club had ever had

Manual Dexterity 

I got off a rasping complaint to Apple 
Special Delivery Software last week 
about the atrocious documentation of the 
Utopia Graphics program, then two 
things happened. I read Todd Rund- 
gren's letter in June Softalk about the his- 
tory of the program. Secondly, two 
twelve-year-olds came to visit and to try 
out the Apple. I had been plodding 
through the Utopia manual in true re- 
tired engineer fashion, making notes of 
all the unanswered questions. I showed 
the kids how to turn the Apple on and off, 
which drive to put the disk in, how to 
make circles and squares, etc. I also 
handed them the manual as an after- 
thought. Half an hour later, I returned to 
find they had created a masterpiece. 
Now I only hope they can teach me how 
they did it. I can only conclude that this is 
a great program.

Venturing a Reevaluation 

I, too, was disappointed in Reed Hub- 
bard's evaluation of On-Line's Cranston 
Manor (April, Open Discussion). I feel it 
is the best adventure program of the 
many I have. Possibly some of my rea- 
sons for liking it are those which led Mr. 
Hubbard to state it is a beginner's game 
and not worth his money. 

The puzzles in the game have more 
logic to their solution than I have en- 
countered in other adventures. The clues 
are out in the open and no obscure vo- 
cabulary is required to progress. Con- 
trast this with the same company's Ulys- 
ses progn^am, which expects a "bribe 
guard" input (obscure verb) to get a nec- 
essary map when there is no hint a map 
exists, or that the guard might have it. A 
further highlight of Cranston Manor is 
careful attention to graphic detail. This is 
especially evident in that the directions 
open to travel are visible in each picture. 
Exceptions to this are noted. Few graph- 
ic adventures are consistent in screen 
orientation. 

It's probably because of these fea- 
tures that the program can be solved in a 
reasonable time. Mr. Hubbard took five 
days and felt it was a waste of his money. 
I did it in less time and found it a delight. 
I feel the game sets a standard for the 
genre. It is the one I haul out at parties. 

Mr. Hubbard states he found several 
bugs in his copy. Besides an implication 
in the documentation about a nonexis- 
tent list of treasures, I found no bugs in 
mine. I did get a bug-filled copy of 
another On-Line product. I sent it back 
and it was promptly replaced at no cost. 



My experiences with this outfit make me 
respect them. Their software products 
are the only ones I will buy without try- 
ing them first.

News That's Fit To Print 

I would like to extend my sincere ap- 
preciation to the folks at Sof/Sys for their 
excellent program Executive Secretary, 
and to the folks at Videx for their excel- 
lent service. We searched for quite a 
while for a program that would match 
the needs of a medium-sized publishing 
company that was used to using very so- 
phisticated multiterminal text process- 
ing systems. Executive Secretary meets 
our needs for promotional letters and 
general correspondence, and it's quite 
easy to use. We did have some questions, 
which Doug Ford at Sof/Sys answered 
promptly. He even called back to make 
sure things worked right. Videx was 
equally helpful with a misunderstanding 
on our part about one of their products. 
We recommend both Executive Sec- 
retary and Videx without reservation.

Comply or Fry 

With remorse, I confess. When fellow 
hemi-hacker Bredhoft begged for infor- 
mation on how to mate his Apple II Plus 
and his G.E. Terminet 300 printer I cal- 
lously ignored the plea, figuring it was so 
simple that someone else would answer 
him. Now I have a couple of eaisy ques- 
tions too, so it seems best to share before 
asking others to come through for me. 

My Apple and G.E. communicate 
very nicely via a CCS Asynchronous Se- 
rial Interface (#7710A) connected ac- 
cording to the directions that came 
with both. Just be sure to use a grounded 
line plug for both computer and printer 
or you may get mucho juice through the 
card and fry it. We like the fine letter 
quality print at bargain prices for use 
with Apple Writer. 

This brings me to my first question: 
For versatile word processing for the 
home, is it better to stick with Apple 
Writer and buy one of the add-on pro- 
grams, look for a new edition to be re- 
leased soon, or just switch to something 
else like Screenwriter in Anyone out 
there who has done it all please advise.

Service a la Carte 

The courteous, professional, and prompt 
service I received from C & H Video de- 
mands public praise. I had previously 
purchased The Menu and upgraded to 
their most recent version. There was one 
bug which was quickly corrected after 
two long-distance phone calls. I was told 
to always call collect, and calls were re- 
turned promptly. There was no need to 
return the software for correction be- 
cause the program is not copy protected.

AUGUST 1982 ' 



I have traded programs with my friends 
on numerous occasions and all were pro- 
tected software. I would not think of giv- 
ing away a copy of this software because 
I was not locked out of the program and 
they asked me to please respect their 
copyright. It's surprising what the honor 
system can accomplish. I highly recom- 
mend this program to Mrs. Ray Gada, 
Jr. (June, Open Discussion). It will store 
recipes, a menu, produce a shopping list, 
and, in addition, allow for two user-de- 
fined variables.

Musing on Modifications 

It's been about a year now since Muse re- 
leased RobotWar. I remember reading 
about it in a feature article your mag- 
azine ran in the January 1981 issue. I 
could hardly wait for its release. I had 
visions of little RobotWar clubs springing 
up here and there, people submitting 
their robot programs to magazines, and 
local tournaments being held as often as 
possible. 

The program arrived and became the 
center of attention for my friends and 
myself for about a month and a half, and 
then it took its place in my file of disks 
and has never been seen since. What hap- 
pened? It had so much promise. Well, 
one day one of my friends came up with a 
robot that boxed itself into one of the four 
comers of the arena and shot at every- 
thing it saw. Given the limitations and de- 



sign of the game, this robot was virtually 
invincible. Any robot that could over- 
come this one ended up being too spe- 
cialized and would get killed by some 
other rampaging battle machine. So ended 
our interest in RobotWar, and as far as 
the rest of the world is concerned, their 
interest seems to have been lost also. To 
this date, I have only seen one magazine 
article, excluding reviews, about Robot- 
War. 

I think that RobotWar could be one of 
the best games yet for the Apple, if not 
the very best, if only a few modifications 
were made. Namely, the battle language 
used to program the robots is a bit too 
limited. It would make things a lot more 
interesting if the robots could be pro- 
grammed to detect what direction the 
shot that hit them came from, and also to 
repair their own damage. Making the 
arena a hexagon or octagon might also 
help matters a bit. I don't want it to be 
thought that I don't appreciate Silas War- 
ner's efforts ; the game is a great accom- 
plishment, but I hope that perhaps an up- 
dated version might be considered.

poor reliability of software. We have 
asked our floppy disk suppliers to run a 
series of tests to determine precisely why 
disks are returned to this software com- 
pany labeled defective. A sample size of 
three hundred disks was retvimed for 
diagnosis; with two disks, 1 percent of 
the sample, the problem was traced to 
the disk manufacturer or operator error. 
In forty disks, 13 percent of the sample, 
the problems resulted from direct physi- 
cal damage to the disks. The remaining 
258 disks, 86 percent, suffered from in- 
formation overwrite. 

To elaborate, under the diagnosis of 
physical damage to disk, our suppliers 
discovered such things as peanut butter 
and jam particles, pencil marks, paper- 
clip impressions, pinholes, and severely 
creased disks, just to name a few. We 
have had customers phone to say disks 
were left on refrigerators and micro- 
wave ovens, only to find the program in- 
operative during subsequent use. With- 
out proper disk care, there is nothing we 
can do to help. 

The information overwrite problem 
deserves the most attention by con- 
sumers because, based on the above re- 
sults, this is the reason why most disks 
are damaged. We have defined infor- 
mation overwrite as data read back to a 
wrong area of a disk. There are three 
principal causes for information over- 
write: misaligned disk drives, disk speed 
problems, and the failure to use surge 
suppressors. For example, if your disk is 
turning too fast or too slow in your drive, 
you can't expect the computer to know 
which sector of the disk all new infor- 
mation is updated to. As the information 
is downloaded to the disk, other vital in- 
formation related to the operation of the 
program is overwritten. Hence, the next 
time you want to use the software, it 
doesn't work. Unfortunately, judging 
from the consumer complaints, the soft- 
ware companies are the first blamed. 
I'm not buying this. For such a young in- 
dustry, manufacturers are aware of 
quality control. 

In short, it's a hostile environment 
that manufacturers have little control 
over. This firm has taken certain steps 
like enclosing tips on drive maintenance 
with all software sold. In the case of Wiz- 
ardry, we encourage people to make back- 
ups of the scenario side using the copy 
utilities provided with each game. The 
master scenario should be used only for 
scenario duplication in the event that the 
scenario copy becomes unusable due to 
one of the three above stated reasons. 

People have suggested that we should 
supply backup disks as do manufac- 
turers of business software. The prob- 
lem with this is the cost involved. Rec- 
reational software sells for consider- 
ably less than business programs, and 
profit margins are not there to allow for 
inclusion of a second backup disk. Out- 
side of suggesting the removal of copy 
protection, I would be pleased to receive

alternative suggestions for dealing with 
the problems I have outlined. Please con- 
tact me by letter only. Verbal sugges- 
tions will be forgotten or inaccurately re- 
layed to me. Address all correspondence 
to myself. Thank you in advance.

Picking at Locks 

Much of what has appeared in Open 
Discussion concerning copy protection 
has missed the point. Cost versus retail 
price of a program is irrelevant when 
dealing with the ethical and legal issues 
of copying a purchased program. If a 
program does $500 worth of work and can 
justify a $500 price tag, then fine — it 
should sell for that. People don't go into 
business just to cover their costs, and 
cost-based pricing of a product is a quick 
way to end up in bankruptcy court. 

I have written several programs and 
my initial reaction was to copy protect 
them. On reflection, however, it be- 
comes apparent that copy protection is a 
knee-jerk reaction that is self-defeating 
to the software publishing industry. If 
you treat people like you expect them to 
be thieves, then they will react accord- 
ingly, while if you treat your customers 
with respect, they in turn will respect you 
and your product. Sure, some people will 
rip you off and copy something, but more 
people will buy your product because it 
will be far more useful to them if they can 
modify it to fit their needs. 

Look at the book publishing industry. 
Have Xerox machines or public libraries 
cost them money? Have Xerox ma- 
chines located in public libraries cost 
them money? Hell, no — the publishing in- 
dustry has grown like a weed since the in- 
troduction and wide dissemination of the 
copy machines, and anyone who would 
outlaw libraries because the readers of 
the books there can copy them has to be 
daft. 

Copy protection has some major 
disadvantages for the customer. Most 
software is sold on thirteen-sector disks 
so that they will boot on all systems; 
therefore 25 percent of the disk storage 
capacity is wasted. Any program that 
writes to its own disk (like word proces- 
sors) has less value in this format than it 
would if it could be copied to sixteen-sec- 
tor format. I am wary of buying a locked- 
up program because I will be frustrated 
when I can see how to make it better fit 
my needs. Most locked-up programs can- 
not be used together, and most cannot be 
used with all of the peripheral devices 
available to the user. I have used Super- 
Text II for some time, and have been 
very pleased with it. Because Super-Text 
is locked up, it cannot be used with a mo- 
dem to prepare and edit files for remote 
transmission. What am I supposed to do, 
throw away my Super-Text and search 
for another word processor, investing 
more money and time to learn to use it? 

As for the disadvantages to the 




publisher, presuming his customers to be 
thieves casts a very serious, harmful at- 
titude upon his organization. Locked-up 
programs are limited in their utility and 
lock the publisher out of many sales. 
Many people have limited budgets; kids 
are a prime example. Many would pur- 
chase more programs if they could get to- 
gether and each buy one program, copy 
them for each other and trade, making 
their money go twice as far. Why try to 
prevent it? Two more programs have 
been sold. Sure the publishers feel ripped 
off, but they can cry all the way to the 
bank. What is worse : no sale at all or two 
sales that turn into four copies? Being 
able to copy programs encourages peo- 
ple to buy them because they know that 
they will get more value for their money. 

The whole issue of copy protection 
also breeds questionable ethics among 
the publishers. Sensible Software sells to 
the public a nibble copier on the premise 
that it will allow its purchasers to back up 
copy protected disks and sells copy pro- 
tection schemes to publishers that it 
claims cannot be copied with its own nib- 
ble copier. And if the publishers think 
that copy protection schemes are going 
to prevent large-scale duplication, they 
are awfully naive. They won't inhibit the 
large-scale pirate in the least, but only 
p'rei^ent the little guy, the average cus- 
tomer, from making a limited number of 
copies — presuming him to be a thief. 
Copy protection encourages thieving be- 
cause it is a challenge to outsmart the 
publisher who presumes you to be a thief 
and then to laugh at him when you are 
done. Most of the illicit copies are going 
to people who would not have bought the 
program in the first place, and therefore 
do not represent a lost sale to the pub- 
lisher. 

Come on, publishers, unlock your 
programs. Quit looking backward and 
worrying about all those illegal copies 
and, instead, look forward and concen- 
trate more on how to increase your sales 
by making programs more useful to the 
buying public.

A Round of Applause 

When we at Superior Software first 
introduced The Quest for the Holy Grail, 
we decided not to copy- protect our disks. 
We recognize and understand the argu- 
ments for protection, but we oppose un- 
copiable and, by their nature, unlistable 
and unmodifiable programs. One of the 
greatest pleasures of owning an Apple 
comes from learning, and one of the best 
ways to learn is to review and try to un- 
derstand what others have done pre- 
viously. Then you can customize pro- 
grams to suit your own specific needs or 
write your own with the knowledge 
gained. A great many commercial pro- 
grams would be more valuable to the 
user if modifications were possible, and 
locking the program in these instances 
may even reduce future sales. The risks

involved are outweighed by the value to 
the user and the basic fairness of provid- 
ing quality software that can be listed, 
understood, modified, and legitimately 
backed up. 

We are not condoning piracy. Dupli- 
cating copyrighted work and distrib- 
uting it (even for free) without permis- 
sion is, and should be, illegal. Pirates are 
thieves who should be punished. How- 
ever, we believe the vast majority of 
users are honest and will pay a fair 
price for goocf software. Apple's Mike 
Markkula stated recently that he would 
like to see the elimination of locked soft- 
ware altogether. Also, Mark Pelczarski 
of Penguin Software announced the de- 
cision to go unprotected with certain soft- 
ware. We applaud these efforts. It takes 
courage and trust in you, the user.

Mastering the Fine Art of Trade- Off 

Much has been said about copy protec- 
tion and related issues. Since a number of 
comments have referred, directly or in- 
directly, to DB Master, I'd like to ad- 
dress some of the technical and eco- 
nomic realities rather than hash over the 
same moral issues. While my remarks 
will refer specifically to my own soft- 
ware, I assume that authors of other 
business packages have similar con- 
cerns. 

DB Master's nonstandard DOS and 
file structure have nothing to do with 
copy protection. They were developed, at 
no small expense, for increased per- 
formance in program chaining, data re- 
trieval, and storage capacity. There is 
copy protection, but that was added 
much later. I should also point out that 
ours was one of the first major programs 
to offer a free backup diskette. For ex- 
ample, we can chain a 16K Basic pro- 
gram module in about four seconds. 
Standard Apple DOS 3.3 takes about five 
seconds from a hard disk, and with a 
standard floppy, it takes over sixteen sec- 
onds. Likewise, our data compaction, bi- 
nary number storage, and lack of track 
sector lists let us get more data on one 
data disk than, we believe, any of our 
competitors. You can also have more 
than one disk of data per file, a feature 
that few, if any, of the other Apple data- 
base programs are designed with. 

Of course, DB Master-generated data 
disks are copiable with any standard 
copy program. You can catalog them 
from normal DOS 3.3 to find out which 
file they belong to and how much data 
they contain. But even if the files were 
stored under regular DOS, as they were 
early in the program's development, 
most of the data would be unrecogniz- 
able without our "unpacking" routines. 
So it's a trade-off. In trying to squeeze as 
much performance as possible from 
what is really a fairly small computer, 
some compromises had to be made. Since 



our intended market was the business 
oriented nonprogrammer, we decided 
to sacrifice file compatibility in return 
for program performance. 

Why not just make all of our source 
code available to our customers, and let 
them make whatever modifications they 
want? There are many very good 
reasons for not allowing that. 

The folks at Stoneware, our pub- 
lisher, do a great job of customer support, 
but there's no way they could begin to 
support users trying to modify code that 
Stoneware didn't write. We've turned 
down a number of offers in the $10,000- 
$20,000 range for licenses to use our ISAM 
system because we aren't set up to sup- 
port a single, sophisticated user trying to 
work with a system that was never de- 
signed for use by others. If only 1 percent 
of the users of DB Master (which was de- 
signed for use by oth^s) decided to mod- 
ify the program or the operating system, 
we would be faced with hundreds of gen- 
erally less-sophisticated users trying to 
deal with, among other things, an operat- 
ing system that will let you save a pro- 
gram anywhere on a disk, including on 
top of other programs ! Let's says you al- 
low your users to modify your code. Now 
someone calls your hotline to report a 
problem in using the program. Is the 
problem in your code or in their modifi- 
cation? At what point does their custom- 
izing void your warranties? What is your 
responsibility and how much time can 
you afford to spend trying to trace whose 
code is doing what? 

It took about five man-years of pro- 
gramming time to bring DB Master to 
market. Since then, another five or more 
man-years have been put into improv- 
ing, refining (all right, debugging), and 
adding new features and utility pro- 
grams. Standard DB Master includes 
about 16K of machine code and over 120K 
of Basic in eighteen individual modules. 
It barely fits on one diskette (the hard 
disk version doesn't) , and the Basic code 
is about as crunched as can be. The oper- 
ating system is just as bad. A similar 
problem applies to users who want to run 
our software on nonstandard disk sys- 
tems. As for "simple" things like using 
hi-res graphics for a company logo (as 
was suggested by one writer) , you gotta 
be kidding! You see, there's this little 
problem: no RAM at the IN#0. (Sorry 
about that.) We weren't being nasty or 
lazy when we decided not to support 
RAM-based printer drivers. It's just that 
we've already broken several crowbars 
trying to wedge a few more features, or a 
little more file capacity, into the Apple, 
and folks, there just isn't any more room. 
On the other hand, we believe our built-in 
printer support is second to none. What 
about using extra RAM? In converting 
DB Master to run on hard disk systems, 
we modified it to make use of a 16K RAM 
card. This gave us additional room, but 
now we're back to trade-offs again. What 



AUGUST 1982 



should we give up (reducing the system 
for all users) to make room for those few 
who require RAM drivers to use some 
nonstandard piece of hardware? 

In regard to trade secrets, we've got 
a heck of a lot of time invested in this sys- 
tem, and we're simply not about to pub- 
lish commented source code for the 
world to plagiarize. There are those who 
feel that spending a couple of hundred 
dollars on a piece of software gives them 
(rather than the authors or publishers) 
the right to dictate how that software 
should be marketed and what rights they 
should have to it. Those who feel that way 
should reevaluate these feelings in light 
of their professed political and eco- 
nomic beliefs. 

Articles have appeared decrying the 
use of nonstandard operating systems, 
file structures, etc. I submit that too 
great an emphasis on standardization 
can only stifle the creativity, explor- 
ation, and willingness to take risks which 
has brought our industry so far in such a 
short period of time. Nonstandard sys- 
tems can cause problems, but they can 
also solve them. How can a software de- 
veloper know if they've made the right 
trade-offs? 

In a free enterprise economy, the 
market will tell.

The Threatening Approach 
In the May Open Discussion, you said 
most companies require six to eight 
weeks for delivery. They don't. They 
can't. It's against the law. Specifically, 
it's a violation of federal regulations un- 
der Section 205 of the Federal Trade 
Commission Improvement Act for a 
mail-order business to fail to deliver 
within thirty days (if no other time period 
was specified), unless the business noti- 
fies the customer that it cannot deliver 
and offers to refund the money. 

A friend and I each ordered a disk 
drive by mail. When it hadn't arrived af- 
ter well over a month, I sent a letter ask- 
ing what had happened and they ignored 
it. Then I sent a letter following the for- 
mat recommended by the book and that 
got their attention; they sent the drive 
the day they got my letter. Seeing my 
success, my friend sent them a similar 
letter, and got his drive equally prompt- 
ly. Soon after, I started seeing notes in 
newsletters about slow delivery from 
that company. Then they stopped adver- 
tising. I assume they went out of busi- 
ness. 

On the subject of copy protection, I 
have a TRS-80 at home and an Apple at 
work. (It should probably be the other 
way around.) Copy protection is more 
difficult to do on the TRS-80 than on the 
Apple. Perhaps that's why few pro- 
grams for the TRS-80 are protected, and 
most of those that are can be easily 
broken. I have rarely seen a serious pro- 



gram that I didn't want to (or have to) 
modify. 

We have DB Master at work (yes, it's 
a legitimate, purchased original). Sever- 
al people have told me it's a very good 
program. I wouldn't know; we don't use 
it. The application I had in mind for it re- 
quires that many people be able to use it 
to look up information, most of them un- 
familiar with computers. I can't risk 
leaving an original of DB Master out for 
them to use. And without modification, 
the information retrieval would be too 
slow. To top it all off, examination of the 
Basic portions of the code turned up a 
routine, poked in each time the menu pro- 
gram is run, that checks if you are run- 
ning a copy. If it decides you are, it zaps 
your memory and your data disk too. I 
would never entrust valuable data to 
such a program; what if it thought the 
original was a fake? So DB Master sits 
unused, while we use a public domain 
database program I got from the local 
Apple club and modified to fit our appli- 
cation. Breaking DB Master's copy pro- 
tection presents the sort of challenge that 
I'd probably enjoy at home, but really 
don't have time for at work. 
Everett B. Ogden, Delmar, NY

Omega Microware, supplied to us copies

phasizes the value of shopping at a local 
retailer when possible. 

Trusting No Longer 

I completely concur with C. Gordon 
Davison's letter (May, Open Discussion) 
on Howard's Tax Preparer. After not 
being able to complete our tax return on 
the revised version, and after reporting 
in detail the errors in computation of 
form 6251 and form 4625 by long dis- 
tance, at our expense, on four separate 
occasions, we finally had to finish our tax 
return by hand. We double checked all 
the other computations since we could no 
longer trust the program. We never got a 
reply from Howardsoft. It would certain- 
ly be in the best interest of all concerned 
if Howardsoft would withdraw the pro- 
gram from the market until these errors 
are worked out. If the program worked 
properly we would certainly classify it as 
the best tax program on the market to- 
day, but not the way it exists currently.

Counting on Your Experience 

I would greatly appreciate any infor-

attractive price for what seems to be a 
very complete business package.

AUGUST 1982 



Just Skewing Around 

Since my article, "The Speed Sector," 
appeared in the April 1982 issue of Sof- 
talk, it has come to my attention that 
there is a slight flaw in the 9 descending 
skew recommended hy Bag of Tricks and 
the article. To give credit where credit is 
due, in an article in Nibble (Vol. 3, No. 2) , 
"Faster DOS 3.3," which coincidentally 
also advocates the 9 descending skew, 
Craig Peterson pointed out that a bsave or 
save to an existing file takes significant- 
ly longer with 9 descending than with the 
standard DOS skew. This is due, for the 
most part, to the fact that DOS prereads 
each sector before writing to it. This 
practice allows random access in text- 
type files. Unfortunately, the preread 
fouls up the rotational delay which other- 
wise would have been minimized with the 
9 descending skew. If the file does not al- 
ready exist, there are no existing sectors 
to preread, and the rotational delay is 
minimal. I had noticed this phenomenon 
while doing timing tests for my article 
but had mistakenly chalked it up to var- 
iations in arm movement due to disk 
fragmentation. 

To avoid this problem, I have 
developed a relatively simple patch to 
DOS 3.3 which will automatically delete 
an already existing file (if one exists) 
each time a save or bsave command is 
given. Adding this patch brings the time 
required to do a save or bsave back into 
line with that of normal DOS with a stan- 



dard skew, making the 9 descending 
skew, overall, a clear winner! Given be- 
low are my timings for each case: 

BSAVE NEWFILE,L$7FFF 

(2 descend = 44.3; 9 descend = 40.5; 9 de- 
scend/patch = 41.9) 

BSAVE OLDFILE,L$7FFF 

(2 descend = 39.5; 9 descend = 58.8; 9 de- 
scend/patch = 42.3) 

One word of warning about the patch. 
First, with the patch applied, DOS will no 
longer give you a file type mismatch er- 
ror if you try to save over a binary file or 
bsave over an Applesoft file, etc. Person- 
ally, I find this a small price to pay. Also, 
the patch makes use of a (normally) un- 
used portion of RWTS ($BCDF through 
$BC71 in a 48K DOS) which an enterpris- 
ing Apple owner might have used for 
some other sort of DOS customization. To 
be sure that this is not the case, use the 
monitor to verify that there is a $88 at 
$BCDF — if so, it is safe to make the patch. 
The patch is applied via the Master 
Create program, allowing one to use it to 
create a DOS 3.3 master diskette. After 
updating the diskette with the procedure 
outlined below, it may be reskewed for 9 
descending using the init program in Bag 
of Tricks, or by other means (if this has 
not already been done).

creating a binary file (using bsave) , and 
then try to save a Basic program over it.

error, the patches are in and working.

Here's a question to Mr. Kersey about the 
results I've had with his recent hints 
(May Softalk). I've incorporated his 
(Beagle Bros) Key-Cat from Utility City 
into the Hello program on several disks. 
It works beautifully. But when I incorpo- 
rate changes to the Hello program, for 
example, from Disk Volume 254 to Disk 
15- Vol 254 (with the pokes as outlined on 
page 133) , the display comes up as usual 
for Key-Cat, but I can no longer make a 
selection other than "A" (where the Disk 
15- Vol 254 is displayed) , and with that se- 
lection, I get a syntax error. I would ap- 
preciate any suggestions.

Speedy Complements 

A brief comment on Assembly Lines for 
April: The two's complement of a num- 
ber is derived by performing a one's 
complement and adding one. This does 
not imply or require that the original 
number be positive. Since the two's com- 
plement of a negative number is gener- 
ated in the same manner as a positive 
number, the same subroutines can be 
used in the listed program. There is no 
need to test for positive or negative and 
then use inverse programs to get the 
two's complement. This will save mem- 
ory space and even increase speed of 
operation by a few microseconds. 
Terry Nimmer, Madison, WI 

A Couple of Mods 

In answer to Tim Klein (June, Open Dis- 
cussion), I know what mod (not a com- 
mand, but an operator) and the symbol 
"#" in Integer Basic mean, but why 
would you want to rewrite a program in 
the second fastest Basic, when it is now 
written in the fastest. Integer Basic? 
Transportability is no excuse now that 
RAM Integer interpreters and compilers 
exist. You must have Integer to list the 
program, so why not use Integer? 

Anyway, mod is short for modulo, a 
mathematical term meaning the re- 
mainder after integer division. It is most 
often used to poke the low-order byte of a 
two-byte number (x mod 256) with divi- 
sion for the high order byte {x/256) . The 
symbol "#" means "is not equal to," just 
like the symbol "<>" in Applesoft. The 
Integer Basic manual explains these 
things on pages 25 and 57, respectively. 
Steve Schonberger, Lincoln, NE 

One way to change mod to Applesoft is : 

MOD A(X) = INT({X/A-INT((X/A))*A + .05) 
*SGN(X/A) 

This returns x modulo a, that is, the re- 
mainder after division of a; by a, if a is not 
equal to zero.

Mediating Immediate Conflicts 

The apparent bug found by Bruce Zweig 
(April, Open Discussion) is not a bug in 
the get command or the gosub command 
and it is not related to the line number. 
The error is caused by using the get com- 
mand from immediate mode. 

Normally, trying to use get or input 
from immediate mode causes an illegal 
direct error. The reason these com- 
mands are not allowed is the fact that im- 
mediate commands are tokenized and 
stored in the keyboard buffer ($200) for 
execution. Since get and input also use 
the keyboard buffer, a conflict over 
memory allocation arises. Characters 
entered would overwrite the immediate 
commands. This is what causes the 
strange syntax errors. The false line 
numbers are the result of residue left in 
the keyboard buffer. 

When a gosub is executed from 
immediate mode, the return point will be 
the rest of the immediate commands con- 
tained in the keyboard buffer. Even 
though deferred mode is in operation 
when the get command is being exe- 
cuted, the return command will return 
back to immediate mode. But by now the 
keyboard buffer has been changed by the 
get command, which results in a syntax 
error when the immediate mode tries to 
resume executing. What has happened is 
that the interpreter has been tricked into 
doing an illegal operation: using get in 
immediate mode. 

The result of changing the keyboard 
buffer in the middle of an immediate 
command sequence is somewhat unpre- 
dictable. The fact that no syntax error re- 
sulted from using a line number of 50 was 
purely a coincidence. The immediate 
command sequence still does not ex- 
ecute properly as shown in listing num- 
ber one. There appears to be no error

when gosub 50 is executed, but adding a 
second command to the immediate se- 
quence will cause a syntax error. The 
gosub 60 : ? "test" command shows that 
returning to immediate mode doesn't 
cause a problem if the keyboard buffer is 
left intact. 

In fact, any manipulaton of the key- 
board buffer can result in syntax errors 
or strange results as shown in listing 
number two. The program pokes a list 
token into the sixth byte of the keyboard 
buffer. Using the immediate command 
gosub : : causes the program to list. Re- 
moving the colons from the immediate 
command will cause either a syntax

So the question is whether or not a 
real bug exists. Listing number three is a 
perfectly legal program. If you run it and 
then list it, you will discover that it has 
erased itself. There is no bug at work 
here. It is an error on the part of the pro- 
grammer that he chose to use the same

sides in. Errors caused by illegal oper- 
ations are not bugs. Gosub and get can- 
not both be used in immediate mode and

I think the trade-off is obvious. The Ap- 
plesoft manual is full of cautions and 
warnings concerning the use of Basic

the normal error checking apparently 



was not anticipated. Therefore, I con- 
clude that the problem is a result of inad- 
equate documentation.

On Track with the Intrepid Programmer 

Most of us can identify with Charles M. 
Larson (Case of the Heavy Manual 
Cover, Open Discussion, January 1982). 
Programmers are a talented breed, and 
we Apple programmers have the best 
traits. As scientist, mathematician, logi- 
cian, linguist, artist, and laborer we learn 
to create life with our computer. But, 
during development, we sometimes be- 
come tangled with our brainchild, feel- 
ing helplessly disoriented, and we may 
want to abort in fear of defects — for ex- 
ample, the can't-continue frustration of 
the word "never," inferring the absolute 
knowledge and power of eternity, as it 
appeared in the editorial statement, 
"You can never have two programs with 
precisely the same name on the same 
disk." 

If we discover thf truth of two related 
maxims — "Never say never," and "If all 
else fails, read the manual" — we will 
study The DOS Manual for enlighten- 
ment, insight, and inspiration about the 
disk operating system. After meditating 
on it day and night, we might experience 
a revelation that revives the for-next loop 
of our creativity. 

For this example, we turn to page 25 
and learn how to save programs by con- 
verting them to disk files. On page 152, 
we're warned about being reprimanded 
with file type mismatch if we use a name 
that belongs to an existing file of a differ- 
ent langtiage on the same disk, and DOS 
will issue no further warning if we purge, 
by saving the program in memory, all 
our existing files of the same identity 
(name) and language. On page 35, we 
find we will be flogged with a file locked 
message if we try to delete or rename a 
locked file, or save a file with the identity 
and language of a locked file. If the 
locked file has the same identity, but is of 
a different language, saving still incurs a 
file type mismatch. We're instructed to 
try again under a separate identity even 
if we have a twin on the opposite side of 
the tracks. On page 17, we receive verifi- 
cation that a program is a file convert 
with a file name. And, as on page 153, we 
are warned about using the DOS rename 
in vain, because DOS won't even look for 
our new name in the directory of exist- 
ing files. It repeatedly allows us to give 
every file on earth the same name; 
though they're not clones, they bear the 
same birth certificate. 

And DOS might look down from mem- 
ory in just indignation and declare a uni- 
versal redim'd array error.

THE BASIC 



AUGUST 1982 




David Durkee subs for Wm. V.R. Smith tWs montli. 



This month, we're going to look at a simple disk utility pro- 
gram designed to make life a little easier for programmers 
who are more prolific than organized. Do you have disks that 
require three full screens to catalog? Do your disks contain a 
plethora of files named "TEST," "TESTER," and "TEST- 
ER2," which you might have used twice last year to test out 
routines you were writing? Have you been putting off deleting 
these unnecessary files from your disks because it seems like 
so much busy work? Delay no longer: the Excess File Deleter 
Program is here! 

Despite the wordy sales pitch, this program is free, so have 
a seat in front of your favorite Apple and get set to tj^e. 

1 00 ONERR GOTO 220 

no D$ = CHR$ (13) + CHR$ (4) 

120 REM MAIN LOOP 

130 PRINT "DELETE: "; 

We will discuss the error handling routine when we get to it. 
The variable D$ in line 110 is for printing prior to DOS com- 
mands. The CHR$ (4) is, of course, control-D. CHR$ (13) is a 
return, which is necessary for the DOS command to work fol- 
lowing a GET statement, which is coming up. Line 130 gives 
the prompt for the following input routine. 

140 GET A$ 

150 IF A$ = CHR$ (27) THEN PRINT D$;"CATALOG": GOTO 130 
160 IF A$ = CHR$(3) THEN 370 
170 PRINT A$;: INPUT "";B$ 
180 A$ = A$ + B$ 

This is a neat little input routine that allows you to enter sin- 
gle-character strings with get or multicharacter strings with 
input without first having to tell the computer which you are 
going to do. It works like this. The only single-character com- 
mands that this particular program will accept at this point 
are escape (for catalog) or control-C (to quit). Lines 150 and 
160 handle these situations. If the character typed was neither 
of these, we assume that you are entering the name of a file 
you wish to delete. The character is printed to the screen and 
the computer executes an input (line 170). Then line 180 adds 
the first character to the string that was just input and the re- 
sult should be the name of a file on the disk. Be sure to put the 
empty quotes in line 170. They suppress the "?" input prompt. 

190 PRINT D$; "DELETE";A$ 
200 GOTO 130 

Line 190 does the actual deleting, and line 200 uncondition- 
ally loops back to the input routine. Remember, if you want to 
leave the program type control-C when you are given the de- 
lete prompt. 

The rest of the program is the error handler. Way back in 
line 100 a flag was set telling the Apple to go to this routine if it 
encountered an error. As you'll see, error routines can be use- 
ful in cases where you know what errors can be expected and 
you want to do something about them without exiting the pro- 
gram. A disadvantage to using these routines in programs that 
are printed in magazines and typed in by the readers is that 
they override the normal error messages. This makes errors 
that result from typing mistakes hard to debug. 

To minimize this problem, you should stop right here and 
test what you've typed so far. To do this, delete line 100 (just 
for now) and enter the line 370 end. Save the program (just to 
be safe), insert one of those overcrowded disks in the drive, 



and type run. To get a catalog, hit escape. To delete any file 
that is not locked, type in its name. When you're finished, input 
a control-C to get out. If it worked as advertised, replace line 
100 and go on to the error handler. If not, it's up to you to find 
out what went wrong. 

The error-handling routine was originally included for one 
reason: to allow you to delete locked files if you want to. How- 
ever, because it defeats the normal error messages that the 
Apple is kind enough to give you, a few other contingencies had 
to be considered first. 



210 REM ERROR HANDLER 

220 ER = PEEK (222) 

230 REM RECOVERABLE ERRORS 

240 IF ER = 6 THEN PRINT "FILE NOT FOUND":GOTO 130 
250- IF-£R = 10 THEN 310 

In line 220, peek (222) returns the code of the error detect- 
ed. If you are curious, you can read more about this on page 
136 of the Applesoft manual. All the error codes we use in this 
program are DOS errors, which are listed on pages 114 and 115 
of the bos manual. Line 240 is fairly self-explanatory. It pro- 
tects you from getting an error if you misspell a file name or 
attempt to delete a file that doesn't exist. Line 250 checks to see 
if a locked file caused the error. We'll see what happens if that 
was the case later on. 

260 REM FATAL ERRORS 

270 IF ER = 4 THEN PRINT "THIS DISK IS WRITE 

PROTECTED": GOTO 370 
280 IF ER = 8 THEN PRINT "I/O ERROR ENCOUNTERED": GOTO 370 
290 PRINT "FATAL ERROR ENCOUNTERED— ERR CODE ";ER: GOTO 370 

These lines are not too cryptic. Lines 270 and 280 cover the 
errors most likely to occur. line 290 covers all other possible 
errors. Note that I/O error and a write protected disk need not 
be treated as fatal errors. To make them recoverable, simply 
change 370 to 130 in lines 270 and 280. 

Now here's the sine qua non of the error handling routine : 

300 REM FILE LOCKED HANDLER 

310 PRINT "FILE IS LOCKED" 

320 PRINT " HIT Y TO UNLOCK AND DELETE" 

330 PRINT " HIT N TO ABORT"; 

340 GET C$: IF C$ <> "Y" AND 

C$ <> "N" THEN PRINT: PRINT: GOTO 310 
350 IF C$ = "Y" THEN PRINT D$; "UNLOCK";A$; PRINT : GOTO 190 
360 PRINT : GOTO 130 
370 END 

Lines 310 to 330 advise you of the situation and tell you your 
options. Line 340 asks for your decision in a single keypress and 
makes sure you gave a legal response. It's always a good idea 
to do this with get statements in case of an accidental key- 
press. If so ordered, line 350 unlocks the file and sends Apple 
back to line 190, where it will try to delete the file again. Other- 
wise, line 360 goes back to the input routine. 

As we pointed out before, an error-handling routine is a use- 
ful thing, but can make debugging difficult. Double check your 
program for accuracy when you key it in. If line 290 aborts the 
run with an unexpected error code, the message correspond- 
ing to that code can be found on either page 136 of the Apple- 
soft manual or pages 114 and 115 of the DOS manual. To get the 
number of the offending line, type print peek (218) + peek (219) 
* 256. Gtood luck! 31 



AUGUST 1982

It was a partnership that would ultimately lead to the 
formation of a new business and an exciting career for her son 
Robert as well as for Sirotek's sons Norman and Robert. 

"It all started with Resin Sands," Fred Sirotek recalls. 
"The sand is coated with five different chemicals during the 
manufacturing process. About two or three years ago, not a 
week would go by without suppliers changing raw material 
prices. It invariably took Mrs. Woodhead about two weeks to 
recalculate our cost and pricing. 

"Not knowing anything about computers at all, I said, 'We 
should have some kind of crummy computer that could do all 
this at the push of a button.' At that point I learned that Mrs. 
Woodhead's son was taking computer science at Cornell. So I 
said, 'Fine, next time he comes up for Christmas or whatever, 
let's talk to him.' The long and short of it is that about four days 
later, while Robert was still on his winter holiday, we had 
bought an Apple computer. And he proceeded to produce the 
programs for his mother at Resin Sands as well as for my 
spoon company." 

"I'm still using my son's programs at Resin Sands," Janice 
notes with a bit of parental pride. "His programs solved our 
costing problems, so we thought others might find the pro- 
grams useful. Fred began advising Robert on initial plans to 
market the programs." 

The first plan for Robert Woodhead's infant business called 
for him to attend a computer show in Trenton, New Jersey, but 
Fred Sirotek was afraid to send the computer as airline bag- 
gage. 

"So I asked Norman if he would drive Robert to the show," 
Sirotek explains. "I think Norman thought he would run over 
to Atlantic City for some fun while waiting to come home." 

An Even Trade. The Boardwalk was to be bereft of Nor- 
man Sirotek's presence that year. "Little did I know what I 
was getting into," he remembers. He was fascinated by the 
computers at the show and promptly suggested to Woo(iiead 
that they work together on the business. Woodhead agreed, 
and the two returned to Ogdensburg as business partners. 

Norman Sirotek, now Sir-tech's director of finance and ad- 
ministration, has an affinity for independent business activ- 
ity. "At the time of the Trenton trip, I had been in Clarkson Col- 
lege for two years in a management program and had just de- 
cided to switch into engineering." But Clarkson lacked ade- 
quate drafting courses. Sirotek left Clarkson and went to work 
in construction with his father in Canada, taking drafting 
courses on the side. Then came the Trenton trip. "For a year 
after that, I worked construction and went to school while do- 
ing Sir-tech ajs a weekend hobby. It was something fun." 

By the end of the year, the weekend hobby had become 
priority for Norman Sirotek. "I detested having someone tell 
me what to do and think. I quit school, stopped working con- 
struction, and put all my energies into the company, keeping 
Bob in touch with the business while he was finishing school." 

Ivy League Computing. Woodhead's initial familiarity with 
the industry began with a part-time job at the Computerland of 
Ithaca while he was attending Cornell. He weus able to work 
with most of the systems on the market, primarily program- 
ming business applications on North Star and Cromemco com- 
puters. That's when he set his sights on owning an Apple, ' 'the 
best personal computer I could expect to afford." 

"That was when they were 4K. I remember a customer who 
had 12K in his machine and we all thought he was nuts. He 
could actually run hi-res graphics. We looked at them and said, 
'Enh, so what, good grief, lo-res is much better; more colors.' 
We couldn't see what you could do with hi-res. We weren't 
ready for the potential of the machine. 

"Though I wanted an Apple, my first computer was a TRS- 
80 that I bought at a bargain basement price from the Ogdens- 
burg Radio Shack. I got a really great price because nobody 
here knew what to do with a computer. I went back to school 
and was fired from Computerland because my boss found out I 
owned a TRS-80. He said it was like a Chevy dealer driving a 
Ford." 



Computerland Ithaca's loss was the Cornell School of Hotel 
Administration's gain. Woodhead programmed a restaurant 
menu display graphics system still in use today. A year off 
from school followed, and Woodhead became involved in a 
veunety of programming ventures, including a budding part- 
nership with an acquaintance from school, Andrew Green- 
berg. 

Going with Your Big Guns. Sir-tech's initial product line in 
the spring of 1981 consisted of a database program, Info-Tree, 
and an arcade-type space game, Galactic Attack. Mail order 
sales were generated through magazine advertising. Weak- 
nesses in the database documentation and the gaming prefer- 
ence of magazine readers focused Sir-tech's early efforts on 
Galactic Attack. 

"It was a good start for the boys, learning from the ground 
up," Fred Sirotek observes. "Neither Robert Woodhead nor 
Norman had too much business experience. I guess they both 
had some credits from the university on the subject, but in 
terms of hands-on experience they didn't have any. So Nor- 
man would come to me for help — you know, 'What do I do with 
this. Dad?' I'd either produce a suggestion or direct him to 
what he needed. Although I am technically the president of Sir- 
tech, the boys have always run the company on a day-to-day 
basis. I'm there when they need me." 

"By not being involved in day-to-day activities, my father 
brings a clearer perspective to our broader planning efforts," 
elaborates Sir-tech marketing director Robert Sirotek. "We 
sometimes lose our objectivity down there in the trenches." 

To the Barricades. Robert Sirotek volunteered for trench 
duty after being disillusioned with career opportunities in a 
large minicomputer company. "I had completed a business de- 
gree at Clarkson College and was working as a programmer. I 
got tired of the bureaucracy, saw what was going on here, and 
quit the job. I wanted to throw my full efforts in with Robert 
and my brother. 

"Because Galactic Attack sales were picking up. Norm was 
steeped in administrative work. To market our products, I had 
to get to know them, including any under development." 

What was under development was Wizardry. 

"I had an idea for a Dungeons and Dragons type game," 
Woodhead explains, "and, just on an off chance, had an oppor- 
tunity to talk to Andrew about it at school. It turned out he was 
thinking of doing a similar game. He had much better ideas 
than I had about the actual internal structure of how the game 
would work. I had some ideas about how I wanted the game to 
look and interact with the player. So we got together and col- 
laborated on the development. 

"I did the majority of the programming on the game. 
Andrew concerned himself with the data structures, the design 
of the scenario, the very tricky criteria in terms of how things 
work inside the game. It was a situation where we each did 
what we were best at." 

Rob Sirotek played some early versions of it and thought it 
was fantastic. But Norman wasn't interested. 

"I guess I was guilty of some conventional thinking," 
Norman chuckles. "I remember late one evening telling Bob 
Woodhead to forget the new game and put his efforts into 
something worthwhile, like a business package. I said nobody 
wants or needs the game. Bob looked straight at me and said I 
was wrong and went back to work." 

Woodhead and Greenberg worked a total of two and one- 
half man-years over a sixteen-month period: about fifteen hun- 
dred lines of code a month, fifty lines a day, one line every 
nine minutes. They had the program actually running in No- 
vember 1980. showed it at a computer show, and got an order. 

"Two months after Wizardry came out, I was ready to eat 
my hat! I'm glad I wasn't more convincing with my argu- 
ment," Norman says. 

"The closer we got to release," adds Robert Sirotek, "the 
more excited we became. But my father wasn't yet con- 
vinced." 

"The boys thought that it was a great game," Sir-tech's top

advisor confirms. "But as far as I was concerned, computers 
were business machines. They weren't fun machines. You do 
things with them that you need. I certainly did not realize that 
there is such a relatively large segment of the population that 
has the computer only or mostly for pleasure. One of the ques- 
tions on the registration cards was, 'How many games do you 
own?" I started seeing 'fifty games,' 'one hundred games,' 'too 
many to count' on the replies. . . . It's convincing. Somebody 
with that many games isn't doing too much business work on 
the computer." 

"Though he didn't really understand computer gaming," 
Normem Sirotek says, "my father did make a valuable contri- 
bution to the product. He insisted that the program could not be 
released until the instruction manual was readable by people 
without computer backgrounds." 

Manual Labor. "Although we had made substantial im- 
provements on the manual," Robert Sirotek reflects, "we still 
weren't prepared for the volume of player questions. A few 
days after the release, the phone calls started coming in. Many 
were technical things that the manual addresses but some peo-

pie don't understand until they hear it. But an equally large 
amount of calls had to do with solving the game. You know, 'I 
am on the ninth level with my eleventh level characters and 
can't for the life of me find the entrance to the tenth level! 
Where is it?' " 

"At that time the company name was a pretty bad pun, 
Siro-tech," Robert Woodhead smiles. "After about the fourth 
phone call at the Sirotek home around four in the morning, we 
dropped the 'o' to become 'Sir-tech' and made sure the com- 
pany phone number was in prominent places on the manual 
and packaging." 

The volume of orders and the large number of phone calls 
caused significant changes in Sir-tech's operations, "making us 
work long hours every day of the week," Robert Sirotek adds. 

Once the orders built up, they just kept coming. That's 
when the company added Peter Bresett and Ljrnn Dupree in 
production and expanded a single machine to a multiple 
machine disk copjang system. The daily production went from 
less than one hundred disks a day to more than five hundred a 
day. 

By the end of its second month of distribution. Wizardry 
was threatening VisiCalc for the number one bestseller spot. 

Help from Above. They rarely lose production time due to 
machine failure. Bresett had lost his job as an air traffic con- 
troller during the strike ; he brought with him a strong ability 
to attend to details and cope with the stresses of production. 
And EHipree "seems to have a sixth sense about which of the 
machines is getting ready to act up. 

"Keeping the disk duplication system fine-tuned is critical 
to our production process," Woodhead says. "We have 128K 
RAM boards in each of the copy machines. This allows us to 
hold an entire disk side in memory for writing to the produc- 
tion disk. This full disk write must be done to both sides of the 
disk. Each disk is then encoded with a disk serial number in a 
separate operation. Then the disk must be fully booted to en- 
sure that the copy is good. If one of the machines isn't work- 
ing, it messes up the whole process." 

"And the duplication system has to double for customer 
service uses too," Norman adds. "Industry experts warn soft- 
ware publishers about the overhead involved in supporting 
business applications compared to game programs. They 
should visit here for a day. People take Wizardry very serious- 
ly. Every day we get letters with disks enclosed requesting 
that we raise favorite dead characters, find lost parties, you 
name it. We even had to include waivers of liability in case we 
aren't able to recover a character." 

Covering All the Bases. Having addressed the production 
and customer service needs, it was Robert Sirotek's job to im- 
prove the company's marketing efforts. Since Wizardry was 
essentially selling itself, he turned his attention to the distribu- 
tion channels. Up to the release of Wizardry, Sir-tech dealt pri- 
marily in direct mail order with a small list of retailers. But as 
the retail store sales caught on, a way had to be found to get the 
product out without having hundreds of small-volume orders. 

Robert Sirotek quickly sought out the best software distrib- 
utors. He had little trouble negotiating significant bulk pur- 
chases. "Selling such large volume orders is a difficult task for 
marketing people in other software houses who don't have the 
kind of buyer demand that Wizardry has," Sirotek says. 

"We still sell to a few retailers directly," he admits. "Un- 
less they specifically want to keep in contact with us directly, I 
explain that we rely heavily on distributors for ensuring rapid 
availability of the program. Most find that my referral gets 
them their order quickly. This improves my distributor's sales 
and everyone is happy. I believe Sir-tech has one of the strong- 
est distribution networks in the industry. Certainly our ad- 
vance distributor orders for Knight of Diamonds, the second 
Wizardry scenario, attest to that." 

Sequel Success. In what is traditionally the slowest period 
of sales in the software industry. Knight of Diamonds entered 
the July Softalk Top Thirty in the number two position, the 
highest rating earned by any Apple software publication in its 
first month of release. Such staggering sales growth has forced 



Proven tools for programmers. 
From Microsoft 



Old friends. Eight years ago, Microsoft put BASIC 
on the first microcomputer. Today, there are more 
than 1,000,000 copies of Microsoft 
languages in use. BASIC interpreter. 
BASIC compiler. FORTRAN, and 
COBOL. A proven set of program 
ming tools. All, fully supported 
by Microsoft. 

The best get better. Good 
tools work better if you keep ' 
them sharp. That's why we 
constantly improve the tools we 
offer. Enhancing them. Increasing 
their utility. Taking full advantage 
of the strengths of each language 
Supporting you, the user, with 
a full range of finely honed 
programming tools. 

Technical support. When you buy 
our tools, you get our number. If you 
have technical problems, call the Microsoft 
support staff for assistance. If we don't have the 
answers now, we'll find them and call you back. 

Compatible documentation. All Microsoft 
languages share a common approach to documen- 
tation. Starting with plain English. That means 
that even when you're learning a new language, 
you won't have to learn a new vocabulary. 

Linkable code. All Microsoft compilers share 
common utilities. A linker accompanies each 




compiler. That means you can write programs in 
two or more languages, taking advantage of 

the specific strengths of each, then, link and 
run them as a single program. 

Leadership in micros. Nobody 
gave us leadership. We earned it 
through innovation, enhanced 
programming tools and complete 
user support. Today Microsoft is the 
only software supplier to offer you 
a complete programming environ- 
ment. Including specialized languages 
that support you in a wide variety of 
programming situations. Tomorrow, you can 
look to Microsoft to make that environment 
even more productive. 

Better tools. Ask your Microsoft dealer 
about Microsoft's family of proven tools 
for programmers: BASIC interpreter, BASIC 
compiler, FORTRAN and COBOL. Each is 
a specialized tool for a special programming problem. 
Better tools. And better tools make better programs.

Sir-tech to continue its keep-it-simple approach to manage- 
ment organization. 

"With the first scenario under our belts," Norman Sirotek 
recalls, "we knew better what to expect when we learned that 
Andrew, Robert, and WARG were closing in on completion of 
the second scenario." 

WARG is the Wizardry Advanced Research Group, a bunch 
otD d D enthusiasts at Cornell, where Greenberg is finishing a 
doctorate in computer science. "They work out the details of 
the scenario and Andrew and I make it work," says Woodhead. 
"With Knight of Diamonds, we had much of the control pro- 
gram complete from the first scenario. We simply had to 
change parts of the code that handle the way new things and sit- 
uations work. Of course, those changes brought out thirty 
bugs; we'd fix those, and thirty new ones would show up. It 
was frustrating, but not as difficult as writing the first." 

"Since my brother was able to estimate closely the flow of 
initial orders for KOD," says Norman, "my administrative re- 
sponsibilities were clear-cut." Sir-tech hired Lisa Carpenter to 
help on the production end and bought a shrink-wrap machine 
that produces professional packaging totally in-house. 

The Importance of Being Earnest. "We like to think that 
everyone here works with us, not just for us, so keeping inter- 
personal relations good is very important," Norman Sirotek 
says. "I enjoy the people aspect of administration, which is 
probably one of the few management skills I brought from con- 
struction that's helping me out here." 

"Keeping everyone happy and working well together is be- 
coming increasingly important," Robert Sirotek adds. "Just 
as production personnel has expanded, we've added office per- 
sonnel to assist in the marketing and sales efforts. Jean Brom- 
ley handles secretarial and telephone reception duties. Our sis- 
ter, Linda, is working with us this summer to help out in the of- 
fice. Together, we are able to keep a healthy flow of orders into 
the production room." 

"With the Wizardry scenarios paving the way, it is clear 
that Sir -tech is becoming a powerful software marketing com-

pany," Robert Woodhead remarks. "I am our chief connec- 
tion with Andrew and the WARG gn^oup as far as developing 
new scenarios. We can sell them as fast as we can develop 
them, but there's a limit, so we have to look for other means of 
product development. 

"In this respect, I see my job developing away from actual 
programming toward managing programmers," Bob con- 
tinues. "For example, I'm working with a Canadian program- 
mer, Gordon Eastman, who has written Star Maze, our next 
release. He's a fantastic progframmer, but he needed a good 
idea. So I designed the game, and he programmed it. I like to 
work that way. I have loads of arcade game ideas but lack the 
patience to do the actual coding. I'm sort of a big-project per- 
son; I like the challenge of a program like Wizardry 

Business School — the Wizardry Way. All the staff has seen 
their jobs change since the release of Wizardry. The demands 
of the market required them to learn quickly. 

"That's why I love working in our own business," Norman 
Sirotek reflects. "I've learned six times what I would have if 
I'd stayed in school. Of course, I've had to work ten times 
harder. But the rewards are there. Like when we hear that a 
child psychiatrist, Dr. Ron Levy in New York, is using 
Wizardry in the diagnosis of emotionally disturbed children. 
That our game is being used to help kids is amazing to me. I 
have a much deeper appreciation for what Andrew and Rob- 
ert have accomplished." 

"There is even a course at the University of Pennsylvjuiia 
where Wizardry is used to teach decision making and system- 
atizing information," Robert Sirotek says. 

"My job is as big as I make it, not like at the minicomputer 
company where everything was spelled out. We have to keep 
learning and growing. It's what makes the 120 percent effort 
we put in here worthwhile." 

Fred Sirotek rejoins the conversation. "The boys are so 
right ; over the last year I have seen them go through substan- 
tial changes. It has been valuable experience because if any 
young man steps into an organization — ^to exaggerate, say 
General Motors — and gets a segment of the operation under 
his wing, then he learns that seg^nent inside and out. But there 
are ninety-nine thousand other segments he will never get to 
see in that organization. The kid just doesn't have a chance to 
see the full spectrum, from dealing with banks to working 
with suppliers, to handling credit, and so on. You just can't 
step into an organization and find out very quickly for yourself 
what's important. If you start up the business, it sort of g^rows 
on you and you grow and learn in the process. I don't think the 
boys realize how much they have learned." 

New Spells for Old Wizards. Packing a year of experience 
under their belts. Sir-tech management is looking toward the 
future. 

"We have realistic growth plans based mostly on the near 
future," Robert Sirotek says. "Over the next few months, we 
have our work cut out for us simply keeping up with the de- 
mand for the first and second Wizardry scenarios. Between 
production and customer service, we'll be extremely busy." 

Star Maze is Sir-tech's entry into strategy-oriented home- 
arcade gaming, the first of what is hoped will be more third- 
party programmed software for Sir-tech to market. They are 
also searching for good programmers to work directly with 
them in an internal development group. 

"I believe we will investigate the business application side 
of the market in the not-too-distant future," Norman adds, 
"although I'll never again suggest that we drop Wizardry 
for it." 

"And, of course, more Wizardry scenarios," Robert Siro- 
tek emphasizes. "You stick with a winner." 

"As long as the boys continue to build better mousetraps," 
concludes Fred, ' 'they'll be able to sell them. What lies ahead? 
We shall see ... we shall see." 

Judging by initial performance, building better mouse- 
traps is a native quality, inherent in the Sirotek-Woodhead al- 
liance. 

It's in the blood.

Peeking and Poking 

The Apple III 



BY )OHH lEPPSOtl 



Picture the Apple II programmer perusing an Apple III Ba- 
sic Manual. Much nodding and smiling. So powerful, so easy 
... so many new bullt-ins. 

But wait. Something's missing. Where are they? Try the 
contents. Not there. The index? Not in there either. How about 
the list of reserved words? Here we go: pdl, perform, pop, 
prefix$. Good grief! They've left out peek and pokel 

Doubtless you're in shock. The Apple Ill's creators left out 
peek and poke. They say you don't need them, that the Apple 
Ill's operating system takes care of all that. SOS they call it 
(pronounced "sauce"), the sophisticated operating system. 
Big Brother in binary. 

The weird part is, they're right. You don't really need peek 
and poke. The Apple II has a lot of little peeks and pokes that 
in the Apple III are done directly with Basic statements or by 
writing control codes to the device drivers. And the big pokes — 
well, if you're going to insert an assembly language routine, 
there's a proper way to go about it. You're supposed to fire up 
Pascal, use the assembler to encode your machine language 
program, and call up the resulting code as an invokable 
module from Basic. Is this really possible? Certainly. In fact 
we're going to do it right here and now. And what assembly 
language routine shall we write? Why peek and poke, of 
course. Ha! We'll fix 'em. 

What they say is : even if you had peek and poke, it wouldn't 
do you much good. SOS is constantly moving things around in- 
side. You never know where SOS is going to put something, so 
how can you peek at it? To a certain extent this objection is 
valid. SOS loads program segments and places variables wher- 
ever it finds room at the moment; only SOS knows where. And 
while most variables remain at the same address once allo- 
cated, some don't even do that. If you make a series of assign- 
ments to a Basic string: 

)Xstr$="abc": Xstr$ = "cclef": Xstr$ = "ghijk" 

each Xstr$ is stored in a new place. So how do you know where 
to peek? the argument runs. 

Peeking Toms. Of course, you may not want to peek just at 
your own programs. Perhaps what you really want to do is to 
look at the operating system. Sizable chunks of the operating 
system do have reasonably predictable addresses that might 
somehow be exploited. But that is just what those friendly folks 




at Apple want you not to do. They have provided a great va- 
riety of "legal" ways to use the operating system, such as pow- 
erful language packages, standard drivers that include very 
fast graphics, and assembly language modules that may in- 
clude some thirty-six different SOS calls. But they don't want 
you messing around in the operating system directly. This 
policy is not merely to protect trade secrets. While it's true that 
SOS. Kernel, the central part of SOS, is considered proprie- 
tary information, Apple Computer has few worries about that. 
You won't soon unravel the complexity of SOS.Kemel unless 
you're so bright that you're wasting a national treasure by 
spending brain time on the task. 

There's a more important reason for keeping peek and poke 
out of applications programs. The Apple in is not intended to be 
a static, finished product. Rather, it is an evolving computer 
system. Improvements are expected; indeed, they have 
already begun. And these improvements will be made to your 
existing machine by simply booting another disk that incor- 
porates the changes. Apple wants your programs to run 
properly on the advanced Apple Ills of the future. And they 
will, if you simply conform to the rules and stick to the tools 
provided. If your program uses "carnal knowledge" of the op- 
erating system and takes shortcuts by poking some magical 
spot, well, that spot probably won't be there after the next up- 
grade. And you'll be back to square one. 

So why write peek and poke? It's not that we harbor an 
overwhelming compulsion to pollute the system with "illegal" 
programs. We'd just like to know what's going on in there. 

Congratulations, It's a Chip. Like the Apple n, the Apple m 
uses the 6502 microprocessor chip. But the 6502 cpu has only a 
two-bjrte program counter. That is, it handles memory ad- 
dresses that are only two bytes, or sixteen bits, long. Now it's 
an inescapable fact that there are just 64K (2A16 = 65,536) dif- 
ferent combinations of sixteen binary bits, so it would appear 
that the 6502 limits a computer to 64K bytes of memory. How 
does the Apple III handle four times that much? It turns out 
there are two distinctly different ways to do this : bank switch- 
ing and extended addressing . The Apple III uses both. 

Think of the computer as a black box. Imagine that inside 
the box there is a smaller box. We'll call it a "switch box." In- 
side that switch box is the 6502. The function of the switch box 
is to shield the 6502 from the hard realities of life ; to delude it 
into thinking that it lives in a nice, simple 64K machine. In 
other words, all the 6502 ever sees— all it knows about — is a 64K 



AUGUST 1982 



39 




stretch of memory. This keeps it very happy. What the 6502 
doesn't know is that the 64K bytes of memory it's using are a 
bit slippery. They aren't the same bytes from one micro- 
second to the next. The switch box watches the 6502 and when 
the 6502 isn't looking swaps chunks of the real 128K (or 256K) 
memory in and out of the active 64K that the 6502 is using. The 
6502 just goes on about its business, oblivious to the changing 
universe around it. 

Fetch, 6502. Fetch! When the 6502 wants a bit of data, it per- 
forms a memory fetch. What happens is that the desired ad- 
dress, one of the 64K memory locations, appears on the six- 
teen address lines of the 6502 chip. That is, each of the sixteen 
address pins on the chip is given either high voltage or low volt- 
age to represent 0 or 1 in the corresponding address bit. Be- 
cause the chip has only sixteen such pins, the addressable 
memory is only 64K bytes. To address more memory you'd 
need extra pins. With seventeen address lines you could ac- 
cess 128K, with eighteen lines you'd get 256K, and so on. In the 
Apple III, the extra address lines are supplied by the switch 
box. The 6502 doesn't know it, but the memory chips actually 
get a twenty-bit address that's sixteen bits from the cpu and 
four bits from the switch box. The switch box (really some ex- 
tra circuitry watching the 6502) gets those extra bits from one 
of the memory registers— hexadecimal location $FFEF, the 
bank register. 

Not all 64K bytes that the 6502 uses are swapped. Locations 
$0000 to $1FFF and locations $A000 to $FFFF, a total of 32K 
bytes, comprise the system bank and are always on line. The 
other 32K, locations $2000 to $9FFF, constitute one of several 
different 32K user banks that can be switched in. The bank 
chosen is indicated by the value of register $FFEF. Thus, if 
$FFEF contains 2, the 6502 will be dealing with 64K locations 
made up of: 

$0000..$! FFF + $2000..$9FFF -I- $AOOO..$FFFF = 64K 
Bank S Bank 2 Bank S 

The low nibble (bits 0,1,2,3) of $FFEF can contain sixteen dif- 
ferent numbers, 0 through 15, or hexadecimal, $0 through $F. 
One of these numbers, $F, is reserved for a special purpose, 
but each of the remaining fifteen numbers ($0 through $E or 0 
through 14) represents a bank of 32K memory bytes that might 
be switched in. So this scheme can handle 15 x 32K (480K) plus 
the 32K S-Bank, or 512K bytes of addressable memory. The 




present hardware maximum is 256K bjiies, but the scheme has 
room for more in the future. 

Don't Bank on It. Bank switching is great if you don't have 
to do it very often. You can run along in one bank for a while, 
then switch and run in another. But if you're running in one 
bank and want to fetch some data from a table in another 
bank, it's cumbersome. And slow. Several operations are re- 
quired: you must store a new value in the bank register, fetch 
the data, and then switch back again by restoring the original 
contents of the bank register. All for one byte of datai'F'urther- 
more, the program code that actually does the switching must 
be located somewhere in the system bank (the part that's not 
switched) . K the program were running in the switched-in bank 
at the moment it decided to change the bank register, it would 
instantly dematerialize itself, a form of suicide reminiscent of 
killing your own ancestor in a time warp. Suddenly, you never 
were. "The 6502, of course, goes blithely on and fetches the next 
instruction from the corresponding spot of the newly switched- 
in bank. The results are generally strange. 

Fortunately it is possible in the Apple III to access any byte 
of memory, in any bank, directly, and with a single operation. 
This technique is called extended addressing and works with 
any of the 6502 instruction codes that use the zero-page indi- 
rect indexed addressing mode. For example, the instruction 
LDA ($2B), Y tells the 6502 to load into the accumulator the 
contents of that memory bj^e whose address is found by add- 
ing the contents of the Y-register to the address stored in zero- 
page locations $002B and $002C. That "indirectly" obtained ad- 
dress is the one placed on the sixteen address lines of the 6502 
chip. 

Take Me to the $1600 Page, and Step on It! But, to access 
more than 64K memory locations, you need more than sixteen 
address lines. Once again, the switch box does the trick. When- 
ever the switch box sees that the 6502 is performing one of 
those indirect indexed instructions, it quickly adds in the extra 
address bits. Tn this case the extra bits are obtained from a 
memory register called the Kbyte. Each zero-page location 
($0000 to $OOFF) has "associated" with it another memory lo- 
cation at the corresponding spot in the $1600 page ($1600 to 
$16FF). Thus, if an address is stored as the contents of loca- 
tions $002B and $002C (a total of sixteen bits), the Xbyte (the 
extra bits for the extended address) will be the contents of lo- 
cation $162C. So when your program performs a zero-page in- 
direct indexed instruction, the address actually used is twenty

bits wide. And twenty bits is more than enough to get all the 
memory in the computer. 

To the more technically minded reader, a question imme- 
diately arises. How is the value that is stored in the Xbyte 
memory location actually delivered to the circuitry of the 
switch box? Does the 6502 have to perform extra load and store 
operations, or what? It sounds like it might be very slow, but it 
isn't. The mechanism is peculiar, even bizarre. In fact, you 
should probably skip the next several paragraphs completely. 
No? Well, the story starts back with the Apple II. 

The Apple II, hke all respectable computers, transfers in- 
formation to the video screen by direct memory ac- 
cess (DMA) . The screen display must be refreshed and rewrit- 
ten about sixty times every second, and the information used 
comes from a pattern of bytes stored in a specified stretch of 
memory. In the Apple II, the text currently on screen occupies 
memory locations $0400 to $07FF, a total of four pages, each 
consisting of 256 bytes (1,024 bj^es of memory). So a lot of 
memory has to be accessed every second just so you can read 
the screen. Collectively this region of memory is known as 
Text Page 1. (We'll capitaUze Text Page to distinguish it from 
a page of memory, which is a sequence of 256 bytes whose ad- 
dresses all have the same high-byte.) The Apple II video Text 
Page is actually four pages of memory. 

A Helpful Vulture. Information is not transferred to the 
screen by the 6502 cpu chip. That would be very slow and would 
tie up the cpu with a task unworthy of its time. Instead, there's 
additional circuitry in the video output section that watches the 
cpu. Periodically the cpu gets busy churning away inside itself 
and the address lines fall idle. TTie video DMA circuits then 
seize the address lines and make a quick data fetch of their 
own. Because DMA uses the address lines only when the cpu 
doesn't need them, the 6502 buzzes right along and doesn't even 
realize what's happened. 

The Apple n also sets aside another 1,024 bytes of memory 



as an alternate source of video information. This is Text Page 
2, which occupies the adjacent region of memory, locations 
$0800 to $OBFF. These two regions are identical, so any partic- 
ular spot on the video screen is mapped from corresponding 
memory locations in each of the two regions. The correspond- 
ing spots will always be $0400 memory bytes apart. Thus, 
$04A3 and $08A3 represent the same screen location as stored 
in the two Text Pages, respectively. Now it just so happens 
that in the binary number system the Boolean statements $U X- 
OR $0C=$8 and $8 X-OR $OC=$U are both true. (X-OR is the 
Boolean operator exclusive OR. ) This means that it's easy for 
the computer to move from a spot in one Text Page to the cor- 
responding spot in the other. It's just the page number (the 
high-byte of address) X-OR'd with $C. And just why this is rel- 
evant to Apple ni will emerge forthwith. 

When it came time to design the Apple III, it was deemed 
desirable to incorporate an Apple n emulation mode. So, at 
least in emulation mode these two regions of memory con- 
tinue to be used for video. Thus the Text Pages were kept 
around. It was also deemed necessary that the Apple in, in its 
native mode, have an eighty-column text screen instead of the 
forty columns of the Apple II. 

Double Vision. The change to eighty columns presented a 
problem. Exactly twice as much data must be moved from 
memory to screen with every video refresh. DMA must ac- 
cess twice as many memory locations in the Apple in as it did 
in the Apple II — and it really can't take twice as long to do it. 
What to do? Well, there are those two separate text screens. 
Why not use them both simultaneously? So in the Apple III the 
memory access path was made sixteen bits wide. 

Every time a "fetch" is sent out over the address lines, the 
fetch returns not one, but two bytes of memory: the bjrte re- 
quested and a corresponding byte from the memory location 
with page number X-OR $C. For DMA, this is great. It re- 
trieves both text pages simultaneously and they are inter-

woven on the screen; a byte from one, a byte from the other. 
You end up with forty-column screens superimposed, with the 
second display shifted one-half column sideways. And there's 
your eighty columns. Of course that extra byte is also re- 
turned in an ordinary memory fetch by the 6502. But in that 
case it is simply ignored. 

At this point some absolute genius at Apple, whose name we 
don't know, figured out that the extra byte returned by an or- 
dinary memory fetch could be exploited. This extra byte could 
provide the extra bits of information needed to extend the ad- 
dress space of the 6502 beyond the 64K (sixteen-bit) limitation. 
When the 6502 performs a zero-page indirect indexed opera- 
tion, it must go out to memory to the designated spot on zero- 
page and get the address it will use for the data fetch. Since the 
address will be sixteen bits, or two, bytes long, it must go to 
zero-page twice. First it gets the low-byte of the address, then 
the high-byte. But the switch box has been watching the 6502 
for signs of just this type of operation. 

The Prodigal Byte Returns. When the high-byte of the ad- 
dress is returned, the switch box grabs the extra byte that is re- 
turned with the address but normally neglected. That is the 
Xbjde. The information from the Xbyte is quickly placed on 
the "extra" address lines, and there's the 6502 addressing a full 
512K bytes of memory. So the Apple III gets extended address- 
ing more or less for free, as a by-product of the DMA video ap- 
paratus. Furthermore, it's very quick, adding a maximum of 
one clock cycle to the five-clock-cycle memory operation. That 
Apple engineer, whoever he is, really earned his pay the day he 
thought that up. 

"Aha," you say, "hold on just a minute. That extra memo- 
ry byte from the DMA business is supposed to come from the 
location at page number X-OR $C. But when you go after the 
address you are accessing zero-page, and $0 X-OR $C is not 
$16. You said the Xbyte was located on page $16. What gives?" 
(Aren't you sorry you didn't skip all this? You were warned.) 

Actually we have another little deception. Zero-page is not 
really zero-page. It is actually page $1A, and $1A X-OR $C is in- 
deed $16. So the Xbyte is coming from the right place. What's 
happening is that the poor innocent 6502 thinks it's getting zero- 
page but it's really being fed something else. It's that switch 
box again. Every time (really, every time ! ) the 6502 tries to 
access any location on zero-page, the switch box yanks the 
zero-page reference off the address lines and substitutes an- 
other "zero-page." In this case it is the page whose number is 
stored in location $FFDO, the zero-page register. So in the Ap- 
ple III there are a bunch of zero- pages. Languages and user 
programs are assigned zero-page $1A (locations $1A00 to 
$1AFF) , SOS uses zero-page $18, and interrupt-handling rou- 
tines use the true zero-page $0000 to $00FF. It's actually possi- 
ble to designate any page as the zero-page, but the Xbyte ex- 
tended addressing mechanism works only for zero-pages in the 
range $18 to $1F. 

If you aren't already dazed, you will be overjoyed to learn 
that the 6502 stack^age is also switched when the zero-page is 
svidtched. Normally the 6502 considers the stack to reside per- 
manently on page $01, that is, locations $0100 to $01FF. But 
page $01 can also be thought of as zero-page ($00) X-OR $1. In 
the Apple III, any instruction that uses the stack (PLA, PHA, 
and so on) actually uses the current zero-page X-OR $1. So If 
the zero-page is $1A, then the stack is on $1B. But in this case 
the reassignment process can be independently disabled by 
changing one of the bits in yet another special register, 
($FFDF) the environment register. (Maybe next time.) 

A Word from Mad Ave. To clear your mind, try contem- 
plating one of the mysteries of the advertising world. The Ap- 
ple III, as you may know, does not have the field completely to 
itself. There's a tiny company in New York, with a little-known 
three-letter name, that has recently moved into the "small" 
computer business. You've probably never heard of it. Any- 
way, the machine they make has a sixteen-bit cpu. A veritable 
revolution according to the ads. But its memory is only nine 
bits wide — eight data bits and a parity bit. So every time that 
machine performs a memory fetch it gets just eight bits of 



data. Nevertheless, because of its cpu it calls itself a sixteen-bit 
machine. The Apple III, on the other hand, returns sixteen bits 
of data with each memory fetch. Does that make It a sixteen- 
bit machine too? It's hard to say. Maybe it depends on who 
writes the advertising copy. 

Extended addressing is really much easier to use than it Is 
to explain. The key to success is to fix firmly in your mind that 
the 6502 must, at all times, have 64K bytes of memory to work 
with. No more, no less. All the complicated swapping around 
must conform to that principle. Most of the time the cpu sees 
the upper and lower sections of system bank with one of the 
user banks switched into the middle : 

$0000..$! FFF -I- $2000..$9FFF -I- $AOOO..$FFFF = 64K 
S-bank user bank S-bank 

We'll call this ordinary addressing. Each user bank is 32K 
bytes long, which is $8000 in hexadecimal. We can talk about a 
particular byte in a particular bank by using a number in the 
range $0000 to $7FFF (which is the size of the bank) . Location 
bank 2/byte $43DE is a spot a little above the middle of bank 2. 
Now the switch box is going to take this whole bank and place it 
somewhere in the field of 64K bytes that the 6502 is looking at. 
In "ordinary addressing" as we have just defined it, that bank 
will start at what the 6502 is now calling $2000. So far as the 6502 
is concerned, that location just discussed will be found at 
$63DE ($43DE + $2000). 

In the lower section of the system bank ($0000 to $1FFF) , 
one page will appear twice. If the 6502 looks at page $1A ($1A00 
to $1AFF) , it does indeed get page $1A. But if it looks at zero- 
page ($0000 to $00FF), it also gets page $1A, assuming, of 
course, that the value of the zero-page register ($FFDO) Is 
$1A — as you will normally find it to be. And yes, the stack-page 
is also, usually, "duplicated," depending on that bit in the en- 
vironment register ($FFDF). 

Cpu, Meet a New Array. Extended addressing presents the 
cpu with an entirely different 64K byte array. This occurs only 
during the data fetch portion of a zero-page indirect indexed 
operation. The 6502 has already got the address and is now go- 
ing after the actual data. The Xbyte determines just which 
chunks of memory are presented to the 6502. For extended ad- 
dressing, the Xbyte must read $8n where n can be any hexa- 
decimal digit. If the Xbyte reads $0n, you'll just get ordinary 
addressing as defined above. 

In extended addressing the cpu sees a pair of user banks, 
banks n and n-l-1. For example, if the Xbyte is $80, then the 6502 
is looking at: 

$0000..$7FFF -I- $8000..$FFFF = 64K 
bank 0 bank 1 

Alternatively, if the Xbyte is $81, then the 6502 sees: 

$0000..$7FFF -I- $8000..$FFFF = 64K 
bank 1 bank 2 

Notice that a location in bank 1, say $13AB, can be found either 
as $13 AB of bank pair 1,2 (Xbyte = $81) or as $93 AB of bank 
pair 0,1 (Xbyte = $80). It's the same memory byte, but it can 
have more than one address depending on where it is placed in 
the 6502's field of vision. 

Pascal and Basic each leave a chunk of zero-page for you to 
use for extended addressing in your own assembly language 
routines. In Pascal you are given $0OEO through $00EF, and in 
Basic you get $00E8 through $00F7. These regions overlap, so 
if you are careful you can use the same assembly language 
routine with both langiaages. Suppose you want to load the ac- 
cumulator with the contents of byte $341D of bank 1. We'll use 
Xbyte = $81, which looks at bank pair 1,2. The zero-page loca- 
tion where we will store the address (pointer) is $00E8 and 
$00E9. First, store the desired address pointer on zero-page : 

IDA #$1D ;low byte at lower location 

ST A $0E8 

LDA #$34 ;high byte at higher location 

STA $0E9

For Cooling 



As soon as you move to 64K RAM or 
80 columns you need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral cards 
generate more heat. In addition, the cards 
block any natural air flow through the Apple 
II creating high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the cards and 
the computer itself. 

SYSTEM SAVER provides correct 
cooling. An efficient, quiet fan draws fresh 
air across the mother board, over the power 
supply and out the side ventilation slots. 




For Line Surge 
Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides essential 
protection to hardware and data from 
dangerous, power surges and spikes. 

By connecting the Apple II power 
input through the SYSTEM SAVER, power 
is controlled in two ways: 1) Dangerous 
voltage spikes are clipped off at a safe 130 
volt RMS level. 2) High frequency noise is 
smoothed out before reaching the Apple II. 





For Operating 
Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two switched 
power outlets. As shown in the diagram, 
the SYSTEM SAVER efficiently organizes 
your system so that one convenient, front 
mounted power switch controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple II, monitor and printer The 
heavy duty switch has a pilot light to alert 
when system is on. You'll never use the 
Apple power switch again!

Then store the Xbyte at the corresponding spot in the Xpage : 

LDA #$B\ 
STA $16E9 

After setting the appropriate value in Y-reglster ($0 In this 
case), we fetch the data with: 

LDA @$0E8,Y name as "LDA ($0E8),Y" 

Note the alternative Apple III indirect notation using @ and 
omitting all parentheses. The assembler will also accept stan- 
dard 6502 notation. By simply incrementing the Y register you 
may step through a whole page of memory without chan^ng 
the zero-page pointers at all. 

There is one problem. Remember that a reference to zero- 
page always results in a swap for the current zero-page whose 
number is stored in $FFDO. If you want to look at the lowest 
page of bank 1, say, $0023/bank 1, yoii can't get there by ask- 
ing for $0023 of bank pair 1,2 (Xbyte = $81). You will just be 
given $1A23 from the system bank because you've made a 
zero-page reference. Instead you must ask for location $8023 of 
bank pair 0,1 (Xbyte = $80). It's the same place, but you have 
avoided the zero-page reference problem. 

Lower than Low. "Ah," you say, "but what do you do about 
the bottom page of bank 0? There is no bank number lower 
than 0, so you can't perform the same trick." That's a good 
question, especially since bank 0 is where the Apple III puts its 
graphics, and you may want to meddle with the graphics 
screen from assembly language. Several areas of the screen 
are in that lowest page of bank 0. In this case there is a special 
technique, $8F addressing. Use extended addressing with 
Xbyte = $8F. This produces a 64K block that looks like ordina- 
ry addressing with bank 0 switched in. The desired page will 
now be found as $2000 through $20FF. 

$8F addressing has another handy feature. In all other 
forms of addressing, the area $FFD0 to $FFEF is very spe- 
cial. These locations are not actually in RAM at all. They are 
on the two VIAs (versatile interface adapters) that the Apple 
Ili uses for all sorts of goodies including part of the "switch 
box" mechanism responsible for the fancy footwork. All the 
special registers are in this area, and it is always on line. The 
corresponding locations in RAM are normally not available, 
but $8F addressing is all RAM, including the thirty-two bytes of 
RAM "under" the VIAs. And what is squirreled away there? 
Why, the system clock, of course. That's why the clock is pro- 
tected when the Apple III is rebooted. 

The environment register really deserves a separate article 
of its own. Table 1 lists the function of its bits without discuss- 
ing them. 

Down to Business. The accompanying assembly language 
program contains the function peek and the procedure poke. It 
depends primarily on extended addressing but, regrettably, 
uses less legal methods as well. After assembly, the resulting

code can either be linked to a Pascal program or invoked from 
Basic as an invokable module. It works the same way in both 
languages. 

Peek is a function and returns an integer value, the con- 
tents of the memory location at which you've peeked. The func- 
tion requires two parameters. You must supply the address 
(as viewed by the 6502) and the Xbyte. Both are passed as in- 
tegers. In Pascal you declare peek an external function: 

function peek (addr, xbyte : integer) : integer; 
external; 

You may then make an assignment statement to an integer 
variable : 

int := peek (addr, xbyte); 

In Basic the process looks like this: 

10 INVOKE "peek.poke.code": REM the pathname of the codefile. 
100 int = EXFN%.peek(%addr,%xbyte) 

Poke is similar, but since it doesn't return anything (ex- 
cept, occasionally, disaster), it is a procedure. It has a third 
parameter, the value to be poked. Value must also be an in- 
teger. 
In Pascal: 

procedure poke (addr, xbyte, value : integer); 
external; 

then one can use : 

value := 128; 

poke (addr, xbyte, value); 

In Basic: 

10 INVOKE "peek.poke.code" 
100 value = 128 

110 PERFORM poke(%addr,%xbyte,%value) 

Don't forget that the variables are all decimal integers. You 
may want to enter them and display them aa hexadecimal 
strings, but you will have to convert. Basic has handy bullt-ins: 
HEX$ (integer) and TEN(hexstring). In Pascal you will have 
to write your own. 

The address can be any legal, ordinary integer. Value and 
Xbyte must be integers in the range 0 to 255. If they iaire 
greater, the integer MOD 256 is used. Only certain Xbyte 
values have meaning; all the rest are treated as 0. Table 2 has 
some useful Xbytes and some comments. There are a couple of 
peculiarities that you should know about: 

1. Nothing terrible happens if you give the Xbyte of a bank 
pair that doesn't exist (yet)— for example, ($8C = 140). Peek 
will either return $FF, signifying nothing, or some value from 
one of the existing banks — also of little use. 

2. The artificial Xbyte $FF (decimal 255) isn't actually 
used as an Xb3^e. It is merely a signal to the function to do all 
sorts of illegal things to the environment register, zero-page reg- 
ister, and interrupts in order to get at areas normally inac- 
cessible. With this "Xbyte" you get a block that looks like or- 
dinary (system) addressing but with "true" zero-page and 
"true" ($01) stack-page. Also, the area $C000 to $CFFF is "I/O 
space," and $F000 to $FFFF is the read-only memory used in 
the "boot process.

Note : There are locations on $C100 page of I/O space that 
will cause the computer to "hang" just by reading them. It 
really isn't dangerous, but you'll have to reboot. 

A Program by Any Other Name. Boot up Pascal, enter the 
editor, and type in the program. Capital letters are not re- 
quired. Neither are the comments, but it would be a shame if 
you left out all of them. You can save a lot of typing by just typ- 
ing in peek and duplicating it with the copy buffer. Then go 
through and make the necessary changes to convert one of 
them to poke. Save the program on disk. Use a path name of 
ten characters or less and permit the editor to add the suffix 
.TEXT to your path name (for example, peek.poke.text). 

Next, enter the assembler and assemble the program. The 
assembler will want to add the suffix .code. Let it. Otherwise 
the resulting file will not be type named code file and will not 
invoke properly. Later you can change the name (for exam- 
ple, peek.poke.inv) and the type name won't be affected. 

The output of the assembler is the invokable module. Move 
it to your Basic disk and invoke it by its path name. You can 
then use either peek or poke at will in your program. Details of 
the required Basic program syntax may be found starting on 
page 160 of the Apple III Basic Manual. 

Pascal is even simpler. You just declare peek and poke as 
external and use the linker to add them to your program.

VENTURES WITH 
VISICALC 



BY )OE SHELTOH 



This month we'll take a look at VisiCalc templates and how 
to convert them from one version of VisiCalc to another. We'll 
see how the Apple Writer family of word processors can be ef- 
fective in manipulating VisiCalc files. We'll also look at the 
darker side of the program and your computer. What if you've 
done everything right and your answer is wrong? How would 
you know? This is a side of VisiCalc and your Apple — or any 
other computer — that you should be aware of. 

VisiCalc Templates. Applications templates are Prefor- 
matted VisiCalc models. Many templates are commercially 
available and more are under development. What do you do if 
you see a template that was not developed for your version of 
VisiCalc? Convert it. 

But conversion isn't all that simple. There are basically two 
versions of VisiCalc running on the Apple. The original thir- 
teen-sector Apple II version and the original Apple III version 
have many of the same features and functions. The sixteen- 
sector Apple n version shares essentially the same functions

HM, APPI£, TRS-eO, and VISICAU; are tra<feiiBi*s respsctively of International 
Business ^techines Cbrp, Afple Qjtiputer Inc. Tandy Cbrp, and VisiCbrp 



as the new 1.1 version of VisiCalc III. 

There is no problem converting templates designed for the 
simpler version of VisiCalc to the more advanced version, and, 
with the possible exception of memory requirements, having 
them run. But if the template you wish to convert uses func- 
tions that aren't in your version of VisiCalc, you will have to 
forego that model, or find a way to program the capability pro- 
vided by the missing functions. In any event, the first thing is to 
determine the version of VisiCalc the template was written for. 

Niffuming. If you desire to convert a template developed 
for the sixteen-sector Apple or for VisiCalc III to run in a thir- 
teen-sector environment — ^in essence, mioffining backward — 
you'll need an outside commercial program to convert six- 
teen-sector data to thirteen sectors. There are several conver- 
sion utilities available and some user groups have similar pro- 
grams in their public-domain libraries. 

Muffining. Any template developed for thlrteen-sector Visi- 
Calc can be converted to sixteen-sector format by using the 
Muffin program on the DOS 3.3 master disk. The converted file 
will run with sixteen-sector VisiCalc. 

DOS to SOS. There are two methods of converting DOS files 
to SOS files. All Apple III dealers have been provided with a 
text file converter program that is simple to use and self-docu- 
menting. Screen prompts direct the user through the conver- 
sion process. It's best to rename all files to conform to SOS file- 
name conventions before starting the conversion. SOS allows 
ten-character names with no spaces. Most users find it con- 
venient to use a period in place of a space. 

A second method of converting DOS files also allows the re- 
versal of the process — a handy capability if you have an Apple 
ni at work and an Apple n at home. The Apple Writer III pack- 
age contains a utilities disk that converts Apple Writer II text 
files to Apple Writer III text files. It will perform the same task 
for your VisiCalc files. In addition, this utility will reverse the 
conversion. 

SOS to DOS. Use the Apple Writer III utilities disk to con- 
vert to Apple n sixteen-sector format. If you're converting to 
thirteen sectors, you'll have to niffum as well. 

After converting your templates, you may hear a series of 
beeps the first time you load your new VisiCalc template. After 
you have completely loaded the file, save it again and you 
shouldn't hear the beeps the next time you load the file. 

VisiCalc and Apple Writer. Apple Writer II and Apple 
Writer III are easy-to-use word processors that can be used for 
writing reports or documents describing the information in 
your VisiCalc files. 

Say you have completed a VisiCalc model and want to com- 
municate the information to others. One way to accomplish 
this would be to include a copy of the printout of your VisiCalc 
model with the report. The reader could refer to it when neces-

by the left £ind right margins used in printing your document. 

Instructions for inserting part of a VisiCalc model into an 
Apple Writer file are simple. After you complete your VisiCalc 
model, save it to disk. Then, use the print command to print the 
file to disk. The method of printing to disk is similar to printing 
on a printer. Place the cursor at the top left of the section you 
want to include in your document. Enter: /PF 
FILENAME<RETURN> (lower right coordinates) . 

Use a different file name to print the file to disk than you 
used to save it. Printing to disk only prints the information vis- 
ible on the worksheet and not the underlj^ng formulas. A print- 
to-disk file can't be reloaded into VisiCalc, but it can be loaded 
into Apple Writer. 

To insert the VisiCalc excerpt into your Apple Writer docu- 
ment, place the cursor in your document where you want your 
VisiCalc table and load the file. Your table is now included in 
the file and ready to print. If the table is too wide for your 
printed page, edit out some of the spaces between characters. 

More Synergy. Apple Writer can also help you develop or 
change VisiCalc files. Apple Writer will load a VisiCalc file as 
if it were a normal text file. In the edit mode, the file looks like 
a list of the commands used to make the template, which, in 
fact, it is. When VisiCalc loads the file, the program reads 
these commands as if they were being entered manually. 

H you edit this data, you are changing the commands that 
the program executes when loading. How can this help you? 
Suppose you have built a complex template with many indi- 
vidual cells referencing a single cell. Now you want to change 
the position of that master cell. Unless the model is designed to 
use the replicate function to recopy all the cells, you would 
have to go to each individual cell and change the cell reference. 

A simpler way is to load the file in Apple Writer and then 
change the references. The procedure goes like this: 

Enter control-B to move the cursor to the beginning of the 
file. Use the find and replace command to locate references to 
the old cell and change it to the new cell coordinate. For exam- 
ple, you would enter controUF /B12/A12/A. The file should now 



have every cell referencing B12 changed to reference A12. 
Even the value or formula in cell B12 will now be in A12. 

All commands in the file are arranged alphajjumerically in 
sequential order by the parent cell coordinates. In order to 
have everything look more appropriate — and possibly save 
problems later — you should move the command referencing 
A12 to the correct numerical position. Save the file to disk un- 
der a different file name, load it in VisiCalc, and see the re- 
sults. You have just made your life easier and saved time. 

There is another way to use Apple Writer that makes life 
easier. Three months ago we discussed how you might want to 
develop a model with an algorithm for solving a problem 
spread through a number of cells to ease development and 
trouble-shooting problems. After you have completed the 
model, you may want to consolidate these cells. You can go 
back and edit the final cell, but you will have had to write down 
each formula first and then make certain that you enter them 
correctly — you won't be able to look at the formulas in other 
cells once you have begun editing a cell. 

A better way is first to note the cell coordinates of the af- 
fected cells and then load the file into Apple Writer. It is now 
easy to edit the formulas into a single formula, save the file un- 
der a different name, and load the file into VisiCalc to see the 
results. 

Does VisiCalc lie? As you build more complex models, you 
may find that your results are not always what you expect. Or 
worse, you may not realize that sometimes VisiCalc lies! This 
is the dark side of VisiCalc and the Apple. They don't really lie, 
they just aren't always accurate (sounds like a politician). 

Every computer or calculator that does numerical calcula- 
tions has areas where the answers are not completely accu- 
rate. This anomaly has to do with the method that the com- 
puter or calculator uses for rounding off fractions or decimals. 
A program like VisiCalc or a computer with its own numerics 
can only carry a decimal value to a specific number of charac- 
ters or decimal places.

VisiCalc, it's completely accurate. But, in order to ensure that 
you don't run into a problem, it helps to understand the ts^es of 
things that can cause errors. 

The most likely area of concern is in dealing with extreme- 
ly small numbers — although in some programs or computers 
extremely large numbers can also be a problem. Boot Visi- 
Calc and let's take a look at an example. 

In cell Al enter 1. 

In cell A2 enter 1+Al and replicate that formula from cell 
A3 to cell A20 using relative reference. You should have 1 
through 20 in column A. 

In cell Cl enter -1-^4^7 and replicate it from C2 through C20 
using relative reference. 

In column C we have a simple series of values showing how 
many times seven goes into the corresponding value in column 
A. Cell Cl shows that seven goes into one approximately 
.1428571 times. Cell C8 shows that seven goes into eight once 
and approximately .142857 times more. Remembering that 
VisiCalc can be accurate beyond what the cell displays, the 
value in cell Cl should equal the decimal part of the value in 
cell C8. That should be true for cells C2 and C9, C3 and CIO, and 
so forth. 

Leftovers. If that doesn't make sense, remember that once 
we have determined that seven goes into eight once, we are de- 
termining how many times seven goes into eight minus seven. 
In other words, we are again determining how many times 
seven goes into one. 

Now, the big question is: Are they equal? VisiCalc can help 
us evaluate whether these decimal values are equal using the 
@INT function and logical operators. 

If you have an Apple II, set the column width to 6 
(/GC6RETURN) so you can see columns A through F. In 
column E we will enter an expression that will compare the 
value in cell Cl and the value in Al divided by seven minus the 
integer portion of the value in Al divided by seven. To put it an- 
other way, we are going to compare the value in cell Cl with 
the decimal value of Al divided by seven. 



Logical operators permit comparisons for equality, greater 
or less than, or inequality. If the comparison is true — for ex- 
ample, 4 = 4— then the cell will display true. If the compari- 
son is not true, the cell displays /aise. 

In cell El enter: +Cl = ((Al/7)-@INT(Al/7)). 

We have now compared the value in Cl (Al/7) to Al/7 minus 
the integer of Al/7. Because there is no integer value, we have 
compared one-seventh with one-seventh and found them to be 
equal. That shouldn't be a surprise. 

Now let's try our original question: Is the value of Al/7 
equal to the decimal value of If the decimal value in Cl 

equals the decimal value in C8, we should see true displayed. 
Mathematically, that is what we expect. But you are probably 
miles ahead of us by now. 

In cell Fl enter +C1 = (C8-@INT(C8)). 

The false indication tells us that VisiCalc has evaluated the 
values as unequal. 

Let's take it a step further. Replicate the formula in cell EH 
into E2 through E6, again using relative reference, and look at 
the results. You see that they are still all equal. 

Now replicate E6 into E7 through E20, using relative refer- 
ence. The values are unequal in cell E7 and every cell there- 
after. As a point of interest, cell E7 is the first cell where we 
are comparing values that actually involve an integer value. 
Have we found the problem? Let's evaluate it some more. 

Replicate Fl into F2 through F13 using relative reference 
again. There is no reason to replicate beyond F13 because the 
second cell referenced in each statement is beyond cell C20 — 
the last cell in column C in which there is information. 

All these cells indicate that the comparisons are unequal. 
And all of these are statements that include the actual sub- 
traction of an integer value. It looks like the @INT function is 
the cause of our problems. 

Where's the Problem? To begin with, the @INT function 
isn't the culprit. The culprit is the rounding algorithm in Visi- 
Calc. The important thing to remember is that when you begin 
using very small values, your results are suspect. Move to cell 
Dl and enter +Cl! and observe the value. In D8 enter ■\-C8.'-l. 
If you enter /GC12 (return) , you can graphically see evidence 
of the difference in the values that VisiCalc compares. 

There are different methods that computers use to under- 
stand numbers. The primary one is the binary system, which 
is the computer's native language. That is the series of ones 
and zeros that a computer uses to understand what it's sup- 
posed to do. For a computer designer, this is the easiest form 
of numerics to implement. It is also the least accurate for our 
use because we use decimal numerics. There lies the problem. 

We understand decimal numerics and we are used to 
working with them, but the computer doesn't like them as well. 
It takes quite a bit of programming to make the computer 
completely accurate in decimal numerics. That is usually be- 
yond the scope of an application like VisiCalc. So VisiCalc uses 
a decimal system that, as we have demonstrated, isn't always 
accurate. 

What Can You Do? There are two criteria that pretty much 
guarantee accuracy if your calculated value meets them. 
The first is to ensure that your value is a terminating decimal. 
In people terms that means a value that realizes a finite num- 
ber of decimal places. The value one-third is not a terminating 
decimal value because it is never resolved. The value is 
.333333 ... to infinity. But one-fourth is a terminating deci- 
mal. It's .25, with no further decimal places. 

The second criterion is that the value be shorter than the 
decimals carried by the program or computer. If a program is 
accurate to ten decimal places, the values should terminate in 
less than ten decimal places. If your value terminates at the 
eleventh decimal place, then the value will not be carried ac- 
curately by the program. 

The Good News. The good news is that VisiCalc is as accu- 
rate for most computations as you will probably need. If you 
are working with values that are too small to ensure accu- 
racy, there is a section in the VisiCalc manual that talks about 
making the VisiCalc program less precise. It

IT'S EASY. 



It seems to 
happen before you 
know it. The 
business is growing 
and, naturally, so are your files. 
But the more room you need for 
files the less there seems to be. 
You've added more people, more 
equipment, more capacity. The trouble is, you're trying 
to add more file space, when what you really need is 
more work space. Those filing cabinets full of folders are 
costing you too much— in time, in space, in money. 

That's where DB MASTER comes in. It provides 
plenty of expansion capability to meet the needs of most 
normal growing businesses that use an Apple II Plus. 
The floppy diskette version, for example, can be ex- 
panded to contain up to 387,000 individual files. Need 
more? The DB MASTER Special Edition For Hard Disk 
Version can be expanded to contain up to 7 million in- 
dividual records. 

Of course, the extent of actual records you may store 
in your particular business depends on several 
variables— like the number of characters on each record 
and the kind of information storage you require. Ask 
your dealer to spell out for you just how much 
DB MASTER can help your operation. 

We designed DB MASTER to make your life easier. 
Sure, there are other data base systems for your 



TM 

Apple II. But if 
you're not using 
DB MASTER, 
you're simply not 
getting all you could from your 
data base management program. 

And there are three powerful 
accessory programs available to 
complement DB MASTER'S capabilities. UTILITY PAK 
#1, for example, allows you to access other standard 
Apple files (including VisiCalc), and even recover dam- 
aged files. UTILITY PAK #2 gives you the capability of 
printing mailing labels. And STAT PAK performs 
statistical analyses on data in your DB MASTER files. 
Of course, there's considerably more capability in each of 
our accessory paks than we have room to talk about 
here. Ask your dealer for the full details. 

Stoneware backs up DB MASTER with a support staff 
second to none. Just give us a call. We can help solve 
your problems. After all, that's what Stoneware and 
DB MASTER is all about.

Exploring Business Basic, Part 11 



We dug down deep in the "SOS 
mines" last month to find a number of 
useful things in the console driver that 
can make interesting applications a lot 
easier and more efficient to develop. At 
the end of that article, which you should 
read before this one if possible, we gave a 
parting challenge in the form of a pro- 
gram listing without documentation or 
explanation. This time we'll explore that 
program.

Digging Out. The mysterious pro- 
gram at the end of last month's column 
was designed to allow you to perform 
four-way scrolling through text files by 
using a number of console features, espe- 
cially windowing and horizontal scroll- 
ing. Rather than describe that previous 
program, however, here's a new version 
with even better features (and some sim- 
plification) . 

1 DIM a${500),rightscroll$(l), 

leftscroll$(l) 

5 INPUT"File name to scroll fhrough:";a$ 

10 IF a$ = "" THEN 200 

15 OPEN#l,a$ 

20 maxlength = 0 

22 INPUT"How many units to fast scroll by? ";zlp 

The program starts with some ini- 
tialization lines. The string array a$ is 
used to hold the contents of the text file. 
Using the disk directly is possible, but 
presents some difficulties that would ob- 
scure the program's real intent. Right- 
scroll^ and leftscrolU are string arrays 
that contain two versions of the scrolling 
commands for horizontal scrolling. One 
version will do a column at a time, and 
the other will do multiple columns, de- 
termined by the variable "zip." 

25 ON EOF#l GOTO 35 
30 FOR i = 0 TO 500:INPUT#l;a$(i):IF 
LEN(a$(i))>maxlength THEN 
maxlength=LEN(a$(i)):NEXT:ELSE:NEXT 
35 lastrecord = i 

The lines above read in the contents of 
the file into a$ and set the values of max- 
length (used to set the rightmost limit) 
and lastrecord (used to set the bottom 
limit) . 

37 sync$ = CHR$(22) 

40 leftscroll$(0) = SYNCS +CHR$(23)-I- 
CHR$(256~zip)+CHR$(26) + CHR$(80-zip) 
+ CHR$(0)+CHR$(2)+CHR${26)+ 
CHR$(zip- 1)+CHR$(24)+CHR$(3)+ 
CHR$(21)-l-"5"+CHR$(12) 

41 leftscroll$(l)=SYNC$+CHR$(23)-l- 
CHR$(255)-I-CHR$(26)+CHR$(79)-I- 



CHR$(0)-I-CHR$(2)+CHR$(26)-I-CHR$(0)-I- 
CHR$(23)-l-CHR$(3)-l-CHR$(21)+"5" 
+ CHR$(12) 

45 rightscroll$(0) = SYNC$ + CHR$(23)-l- 
CHR${zip)+CHR$(26)-l-CHR$(0)+CHR$(0) + 
CHR$(2)+CHR$(26)-l-CHR$(zip- 1) + 
CHR$(23)-fCHR$(3)+CHR$(21)-l-"5" 
+CHR$(12) 

46 rightscroll$(l )=SYNC$-I-CHR$(23) + 
CHR$(l)-fCHR$(26)-l-CHR$(0)+CHR$(0) + 
CHR$(2)+CHR$(26)-I-CHR${0)-I-CHR$(23)+ 
CHR$(3)-l-CHR$(21)+"5"+CHR$(12) 

50 scrollup$=CHR$(16)-l-CHR${3)+CHR$(26) + 
CHR$(0) + CHR$(23)-fCHR$(10)+CHR$(21)+ 
"5" +SYNC$ 

55 scrolldown$ = CHR$(16)+CHR$(3)-l- 
CHR$(12)+CHR$(11)-I-SYNC$ 

The lines above set up the scrolling 
commands to be issued to the console 
driver. It would be useful to follow along 
in your Standard Device Drivers manual 
in the section on the console driver, but 
here is one example that will help you 
through it: 

Line 41 defines the character codes 
necessary to set up scrolling horizontally 
to the left, one character position at a 
time. Here's how the character se- 
quence works. First comes the sync char- 
acter (decimal 22) , which is used to start 
the action in step with the screen re- 
fresh. This helps to eliminate flicker. 
Next, character 23 is the command to 
horizontally shift the screen. The follow- 
ing character, 255, determines that the 
shift is one character position to the left. 
This action leaves the rightmost column 
on the screen blank ; it will later be filled 
by information previously off the screen. 

Opening the Window. To create a 
place to put this data, the next two sets of 
commands create a window one column 
wide and twenty-four lines high in which 
to write. Character sequence 26,79,0 ad- 
dresses the cursor to column 79, line 0; 
and character 2 establishes this position 
as the upper right corner of the window. 
Since cursor addressing is done relative 
to the window, the next command se- 
quence (characters 26,0,23) puts the cur- 
sor at the bottom of this one-column win- 
dow. Printing a character 3 there estab- 



AUGUST 1982 



57 



lishes the position as the lower right cor- 
ner of the window. From now on, this will 
be the only console area which can be 
written to. 

The next two characters (decimal 21 
and the literal "5") set up cursor move- 
ment options that will allow us to write 
data into this window very rapidly (the 
"5" option has the effect of turning off 
scrolling and new- line, while leaving 
"wrap" and cursor advance intact). This 
means that if a single string is written in- 
to this window, the characters will spill 
down the screen, one per line. One twen- 
ty-character string could fill the entire 
window, written with one print state- 
ment. This is much, much faster than in- 
dividually positioning the cursor and then 
printing the characters one at a time. 

The last character in the string in line 
41 (the form-feed character, decimal 12) 
serves to home the cursor to the top left 
of the window (in this case column 79, 
line 0) preparing us to print the missing 
string which will fill the blank space cre- 
ated by the horizontal shift. Notice also 
that line 40 is nearly identical, except that 
the position of the top left and bottom 
right of the window are determined by 
the value of "zip." 

Right scrolling is handled in the same 
way, by setting up characters in right- 
scroll. Check through those characters to 
make sure you understand what's hap- 
pening. 

60 HOME:PRINT CHR$(21);"5"; 

65 FOR i=0 TO 23:IF LEN(a$(i))>80 THEN 

PRINT MID$(a$(i),l,80);: 

NEXT:ELSE PRINT a$(i):NEXT 

These two hnes disable vertical scroll- 
ing and put the first twenty-four lines of 
the text file on the screen. Note that care 
is taken to put only the first eighty char- 
acters of each line on the screen — and 
that by disabling scroll it is possible to 
write the screen completely full. 

(Make sure there are twenty-four 
spaces between quote marks in line 72.) 

70 hi=1:vl=24:TEXT 

72 blank24$=" 

73 bnk$="" 

75 FOR i=l TO zip:bnk$=bnk$+blank24$:NEXT 

These lines do further initialization. 
The variables hi and vi stand for hori- 
zontal and vertical indexes, which tell the 
program where the lower lefthand cor- 
ner of the screen is in the text file. 
Blank2U$ and bnk$ are areas to store data 
that's to be written rapidly to the 
screen — for single column scroll and 
multiple column scroll, respectively. 

80 GET a$:cursor=ASC(a$) 
85 move = (cursor=8)-l-2*(cursor=21)-l- 
3*(cursor=10)+4*(cursor=l 1) + 
5*(cursor= 136)-l-6*(cursor=149) 
88 b$ = blank24$:t=1 

90 ON move+1 GOSUB 130,100,105,110,120, 

135,140 
95 TEXT:GOTO 80 

The section above represents the ma- 



jor loop of the program. Here the cursor 
commands are accepted in line 80, and 
decoded into a command number in line 
85. Be sure you understand how line 85 
creates values using the logical expres- 
sions. This is really handy (Pascal users 
have something similar in the case state- 
ment) . Once the move variable is calcu- 
lated, then an on .. . gosub statement is 
used to go to the appropriate subroutine. 
Note that values 1,2,3,4 of move corre- 
spond with left, right, down, and up on 
the cursor keys. Values 5 and 6 represent 
the left and right arrow keys with the 
open- Apple key pressed. Remember that 
open- Apple adds 128 to the ASCII value of 
the key. This trick is going to be used to 
implement the "zip" mode we defined 
above. Just watch! 

100 IF hi>t THEN lndex = vi-25:hiindex 

= hi-t:FOR i=l TO 24;SUB$(b$,t*j-t+ 
l,t)=MID$(a$(index-l-j),hiindex,t): 
NEXT:hi=hi-t:PRINT rlghtscroll$((t=l)) 
;b$; 

102 RETURN 

105 IF hi-l-80<=maxlength THEN index=vi-25: 
hiindex=80-l-hi:FOR j=l TO 24:SUB$ 
(b$,t*i-t-f- 1 ,t)=MID$(a$(index-|-j), 
hiindex,t):NEXT:hi = hi-l-t:PRINT 
leftscroll$((t=l));b$; 

107 RETURN 

Here's where things get a bit sticky. 
Remember that we said that the tech- 
nique for scrolling was to use the console 
horizontal shift and then fill in the empty 
space with the appropriate characters 
from the file. Here then are the routines 



AT LAST. 



that perform the horizontal shift. One 
100 implements the left-arrow function by 
first checking to see if the horizontal in- 
dex (hi) is greater than the left shift (t) 
required. If everything is okay, then iw- 
dex is set to the top of the twenty-four 
lines of text to be scrolled, and the new 
left edge is calculated and assigned to hi- 
index. Then a loop in this same line fills 
b$ with the appropriate contents of a$, 
the array containing the file contents. 
The SUB$ function is used to increase the 
performance of this loop, by directly sub- 
stituting characters in an existing string. 
With this completed, the horizontal in- 
dex is adjusted by the width of the scroll; 
then a print statement directs the special 
characters required to do the horizontal 
shift. 

Note that another logical expression 
(t=l) is used to pick the appropriate 
string from the two just defined. Imme- 
diately after the scroll string is printed, 
the b$ string is printed, which spills down 
the vertical window the characters pre- 
viously extracted from the text array. By 
using this technique, it is possible to 
scroll so fast that it looks like you're not 
even writing characters on the screen. 
The only slow part of this routine, in fact, 
is in the loop that creates the string b$ to 
be written. 

The scroll routine in line 105 is simi- 
lar, except for the fact that it must first 
check to be sure that scrolling doesn't oc- 
cur past the end of the longest line (pre- 
viously calculated as maxlength) .

These routines may not become clear 
without pencil, paper, and some dia- 
grams. Apologies are offered for the ob- 
scure way that many statements are 
crammed into one line; but breaking 
everything out neatly would consider- 
ably worsen performance. Besides, after 
all these articles you can probably make 
sense out of anything. 

no IF vi<lastrecord THEN PRINT 

scrollup$;MID$(a$(vi),hi,80);:vi = vi-|-l 
115 RETURN 

120 IF vi>24 THEN PRINT scrolldown$; 

MID$(a$(vi-25),hi,80);:vi = vi-l 
125 RETURN 

Lines 110 and 120 are vertical scroll- 
ing, and therefore considerably easier. 
After checking to be sure that scrolling is 
allowed, the scroll characters are print- 
ed and the appropriate substring is print- 
ed to the screen. Note that the MID$ func- 
tion makes selecting eighty characters 
from the string very easy. 

130 IF cursor=27 THEN POP:GOTO 200 
132 RETURN 

135 IF hi>zip THEN t=zlp:b$ = bnk$ 

137 GOSUB 100:RETURN 

140 IF hH-79+zip<=maxlength 

THEN t=zlp:b$ = bnk$ 
142 GOSUB 105:RETURN 

line 130 handles the case of stray 
characters, and uses the escape key 
(Ascii 27) as the way out of the routine. 
Lanes 135 and 140 handle the case of the 



open-apple cursor keys. Note that if the 
full "zip" increment on cursor move- 
ment is not possible, the routine reverts 
to the initial conditions: a horizontal shift 
of one, set in line 88. After setting the ap- 
propriate value, a gosub is executed to 
the main scroll subroutine. 

200 TEXT:PRINT CHR$(26);CHR$(0);CHR$(23); 
210 CLOSE 
220 END 

Last but not least is the wrap-up and 
conclusion, positioning the cursor to the 
bottom of the screen and terminating the 
program. 

File Frolic. Well, here's hoping that 
you have lots of fun playing with this pro- 
gram and the various text files you have 
lying around. One note of caution, how- 
ever. Because of the limit in Basic of 255 
characters in a string, this program will 
not work with all text files. Among 
these are many Apple Writer III files be- 
cause it is easy to create enormous 
amounts of text without benefit of inter- 
vening carriage return characters. If you 
want to test the program with Apple 
Writer or similar text files, you'll want to 
print them out to disk first (instead of 
simply saving them) and then load them 
into the scroll program. This works 
equally well with VisiCalc print files — as 
long as the width is not more than 255 
characters. 

If you really want a text file to fool 



with, check back to last month's issue 
where we described a gibberish-generat- 
ing program that's guaranteed to pro- 
duce interesting things to scroll through. 
Some people have claimed that it can be 
used to create this column as well, but 
lining up that infinite number of mon- 
keys at an infinite number of Apple Ills 
has some bugs still to be worked out. Oh, 
well . . . 

Last Challenge. Last article we 
covered a lot of esoteric goodies in the 
console driver. One of the least under- 
stood, but most powerful capabilities is 
the "two byte read," where you can pro- 
grammatically get a second byte that, 
among other things, can indicate wheth- 
er enter or return has been pressed. Nor- 
mally these two keys return the same 
ASCII code, but the data entry routines 
above cry out for that distinction, which 
we provided in this article by using tab 
and open-apple, return. It's not easy to 
figure this one out, and some substantial 
rewriting of the field routines may be re- 
quired, but we'll offer a copy of Quickfile 
III to the earliest postmarked solution. 
Send a listing to Softalk marked "The 
Third Basic Solution," and the winning 
routine will be published as soon as pos- 
sible in these pages. 

Next month we'll go even further into 
the uses of the console features in con- 
structing business oriented applications 
programs. Until then, keep koding with 
the kool konsole. A

HAVEN'T YOU HEARD 
OF THUNDERCLOCK PLUS ? 




If you want to put 
your Apple® to work — around the 
clock — Thunderclock Plus is the solution. Just plug it 
in and your programs can read the month, date, day of 
week and time — down to the second — in any of Apple's 
languages. So your Apple can do any number of tasks 
for you automatically. In the office, the lab or at home. 

Most good software packages for business, data base 
management, communications and time management 
are made to read Thunderclock Plus. (It's compatible 
with DB Master,* Micro- Courier** and VisiDex^, to 
name a few). So no matter how you use your Apple now, 
Thunderclock Plus can make it a more versatile

For example, with business or communi- 
cations software, your Apple can auto- 
matically access a data base or send elec- 
tronic mail when the rates are lowest. 

In addition, Thunderclock Plus can 
organize your disk files. Our optional 
DOS-DATER™ software upgrades the 
regular DOS on your disks. So every 
time a program is saved or a file is modi- 
fied, the time and date, to the minute, 
are stored in the CATALOG with the file 
name. Now you can instantly know 
exactly when your files were last updated. 



r^/"^^ Thunderclock Plus 

^ can even give you a sense of 

security. Or just make your life a little easier. With our 
X-10 interface option and a BSR X-10* Home Control 
System, your Apple can turn on your lights, water your 
lawn . . .whatever you desire, according to schedules you 
create. It comes with our menu-driven SCHEDULER 
software. So it's easy to design and modify schedules 
that can run in the "background" while you have 
"hands-on" use of your Apple. 

Thunderclock Plus comes with a one-year warranty. 
Powered by on-board batteries, it runs accurately for up 
to four years without battery replacement. 

So now that you've heard of Thunderclock Plus, isn't

When last we left off, we had a program that would create 
Applesoft shapes and had clues to the real meaning of anima- 
tion. By plotting a shape, updating the coordinates, erasing it, 
and then replotting, all in a loop, we could create the illusion (if 
not the actuality) of movement. "Now," the Chief Inspector 
asked, "can that illusion be created using a joystick, or key- 
board, or some predetermined function or path?" Probably so. 
The evidence supports the possibility. 

Exhibit A shows the beginning of a program that will load 
and initialize a shape made with last month's Maker. If you 
don't have last month's column, refer to Exhibit B, which has 
the beginning of a program that creates a shape in the form of 
a little tiny circle and does the same initialization. Either one 
of the two exhibits must be used in conjunction with the other 
exhibits in this investigation. 

Exhibit C provides overwhelming evidence that a shape

can indeed be controlled with a joystick. You may notice some 
similarities to the third example posed last month, but it has 
been proven in court at least once that if the fig^ures are 
changed, a program is entirely different. Notice that line 50 
simply sets the starting point for the animation. The anima- 
tion loop runs from lines 60 through 100. Line 60 does the draw, 
line 70 saves the old coordinates, line 80 does the update, and 
line 90 erases. The key is line 80, where the update occurs. 

The variable S in lines 55 and 80 controls the sensitivity of 
the joystick, and its value can range from 1 to 127. The lower 
the value, the less sensitive the joystick will be to your move- 
ments. The function in line 80 takes the joystick values, which 
range from 0 to 255, and maps them to a range of -1 to 1 (when 
the sensitivity is increased, the range of values will eventually 
increase also) . This way, based on the setting of the joystick, X 
and Y will either increase or decrease by 1. 

Testing the Waters. Also in line 80 is a gosub (go to 
subroutine) to line 200, which is the beginning of a sequence of 
if-then statements that test the values of X and Y. If either is 
out of the proper range (0-279 for X; 0-191 for Y), the subroutine 
assigns the value for the edge of the screen. Each of the pro- 
grams — er, exhibits— contains a similar subroutine that pre- 
vents an out of range error. 

Exhibit D contains essentially the same program, with a 
few lines added that allow your animation to leave a trail (an- 
swering the trick question, ' 'Can you draw with it?") . Lines 45, 
85, 86, and 95 have been added and eillow you to turn hplot on 
and off with the two button inputs. Line 95 does the hplot (when 
P=l, the routine does the hplot; when P=0, it skips the plot). 
Lines 85 and 86 read the buttons, and if either is pushed, change 
the value of P accordingly. You may want to try changing the 
value of S (sensitivity, remember?) in line 55 to a value of 100 
or so, just to see the difference in the handling of the joystick.

But suppose you don't have a joystick. Never fear, much 
the same can be done through the keyboard! Enter Exhibit E. 
The changes from the joystick example have all been made be- 
tween lines 70 and 90. Instead of updating the position using 
joystick reads, line 72 checks to see if a key has been pressed. 
K one hasn't, the program skips down to line 84 and uses what- 
ever increments were in effect before (XI and YI) . If a key has 
been pressed, however, line 74 gets the value of the key, and a 
sequence of if statements determines what is to be done based 
on the key that's been pressed. If the letter I has been pressed,

for example, the X increment is set to zero and the Y incre- 
ment to negative one, causing the next movement to be up- 
ward. M causes a downward move, and J and K move left and 
right, respectively. A space sets both increments to zero, 
which stops movement, and, to keep your imagination going, W 
moves several units at a time down and right. Also, the Z and X 
keys are set up to turn plotting on and off, as the last example 
(piece of evidence?) reveals. 

Suppose you want to get the computer to control your ani- 
mated shape in some fashion. You have several ways to do 
this. One is by using some type of formula to determine the 
new coordinates. Another is by predefining a path for the 
shape. A third is to let the computer generate a random path. 

The first method, using a formula, is probably the most dif- 
ficult because it requires some use of (ugh) mathematics. Ex- 
hibit F shows how it's used, but this is not the place to get into 
heavy discussion of the sociological value of sines, cosines, and 
absolute values. This particular part will be short and sweet. 

Aren't We Qever. Another subroutine has been added at 
line 150. It evaluates a function — being very creative, we tried 
using sin(X) — and returns an X,Y coordinate scaled to fit the 
screen. How? Okay, first, the initial values of X and Y are com- 
puted and plotted at line 50, using the subroutine, of course. XC 
and YC will be the aptual coordinates used in the functions. X 
and Y will be the values that later fit the screen. The anima- 
tion loop has a for-next counter that changes XC from .1 to 28 in 
increments of .1. Those were chosen because sin was used for a 
function (it cycles through four circles, using radian meas- 
ure) , and it was easy to adjust to the screen. Within the loop, 
the updating is done by calling the subroutine at line 150. 

In the subroutine, YC is first calculated as a function of XC. 
The next two lines scale X and Y appropriately. Since XC goes 
from 0 to 28 and we want X to go from 0 to 279 (the screen coor- 
dinates), we can multiply whatever XC is by 10 so it fits the 
screen exactly. Y is a little more tricky; see line 170. Since we

know that sin gives results from -1 to 1, we want to multiply 
that by something to get more than a two unit vertical move- 
ment. If we were graphing the exact function, 10 would be ap- 
propriate, since that's what we multiplied X by. To make it a 
little more dramatic, though, we used 20. That makes the low 
end -1*20 or -20, and the high end 1*20 or 20. 

Since the actual screen values for Y are all positive (from 0 
to 191) , we then added 95 to center the results vertically on the 
screen (-20-1-95=75, 20-1-95=115). The last step, if we are wor- 
rying about an accurate result, is to subtract all of the above 
from 191. That's because on the hi-res screen the Y values all 
appear reversed from the way your experience with normal 
graphing would lead you to expect. Of course, if we are just us- 
ing a function for effect and not for accurate plotting, this last 
step can be left out. Note in the program that line 55 sets P so 
that the trail will be plotted. 

If none of that made sense, or if it wasn't very interesting, 
here's another approach that has some more immediate re- 
sults. See Exhibit G. Similar in a way to what we did with key- 
strokes, this program sets a path in advance that determines

how the shape will move. First, line 55 optionally sets P so that 
the trail will be plotted and sets N, the number of moves in the 
path, to 20 ; but you can choose whatever you want. Lines 60-100 
compose the animation loop again. This time a for-next loop 
counts from 1 to N, and each time through the next move, M is 
read from a data statement (line 150) . Line 74 is called a "com- 
puted goto" statement. Program control goes to the line num- 
ber in the list that corresponds to the value of M. If M=3, for 
example, it will use the third line number, 77. Each of the eight 
lines sets the X and Y increments so that moves correspond- 
ing to 1 through 8 give the directions shown in figure 1. 

Looping the Loop. Note that the data statement at line 150 
contains numbers that, when read by the program, will corre- 
spond to these directions. After the animation loop completes 
N moves (finishing the list of numbers in the data statement) , 
the restore in line 110 starts the data at the beginning of the list 
again and causes the path to be repeated. 

Note also that in the subroutine that begins at line 200, the 
values have been changed slightly. Now, if a shape gets to the 
edge of the screen, instead of stopping it there, the program 
puts it at the opposite edge so it can continue. Something simi- 
lar was done in line 210 of Exhibit F, where we put a formula 
that, instead of using X, uses the remainder after dividing by 
279. In that example, try changing the number 28 in line 60 to 
something like 56. 

The last exhibit in this case for animation is Exhibit H, in

there be a clue there? Maybe not. . . .

Twenty-Six Miles Across the Sea 

BV niCUAEL FERRIS 



Zane Grey, the great western novelist, did some of his writ- 
ing twenty-six miles off the coast of California. A hotel there 
bears his name. 

In the early days of Hollywood, a motion picture company 
went to the same eight-by-twenty-one-mile dot of paradise to 
shoot a western. They left a few buffalo behind; now hundreds 
roam the island. 

Cool in the summer, warm in winter, the fabled isle of 
Santa Catalina was once owned by chewing gum king William 
Wrigley. In 1929, Wrigley built a casino on the tip of Avalon 
Bay. A round, Arabian fantasy with fluted sides, the casino is 
the island's most famous landmark. 

Today, a new kind of landmark — an Apple that invites visi- 
tors to leave fingerprints all over its monitor's face — sits on the 
edge of the Pleasure Pier. In the window of the Avalon Cham- 
ber of Commerce, right over the water, a video screen wel- 
comes people to the island with an invitation: "Please touch." 
When you press a purple dot next to an item on the menu, you 
get a visuaJ sampling of some of the shops and services of 
Catalina, a scrolling screen of sponsors who claim to have the 
best places in town to eat, sleep, and play. 

This innovative, interactive advertising is the brainchild of 
Island Services and the handiwork of Mark Wauben, who pro- 
grammed the graphics on the forty-eight-item display. Wau- 
ben and his partner, Kent Haggerty, distribute the Touch 



Screen device that fits over a standard CRT screen and runs on 
an Apple. 

Heart of Glass. The Touch Screen is a special touch-sensi- 
tive plate of glass that carries a light charge. When you touch 
the surface, it breaks the current at a given set of coordinates. 
The computer then goes into the program and lifts the correct 
information from the disk. 

According to Wauben, the touch-style information service is 
far more fun than conventional information services. "It has 
the same appeal as a video game. People like to participate 
in it." 

And sure enough, when Wauben and Haggerty demon- 
strate the Touch Screen, people approach it eagerly and grin 
as they make it work — an effect most advertisers can't lay 
claim to. 

"All our lives we are told not to touch things, then we come 
along with a television screen you have to touch to make work. 
People are a little reluctant at first, so we employ a little hu- 
mor to encourage them to use it," Wauben explains. 

Surveys conducted by Touch Technology, the Touch Screen 
manufacturers in Annapolis, Maryland, show that the video 
screen captures the attention of 60 percent of an audience— 20 
percent of them repeat users. 

"I think the information reaches more people more effec- 
tively because it is information they have sought out them-

selves," Wauben says. 

The general state of public telephones prompted Island Serv- 
ices to create their scrolling Yellow Pages for Catalina. "Kent 
and I were walking down a pier past a bank of phone booths 
with their phone books hanging down and pages ripped out," 
Wauben explains. "It seemed that anyone who wanted local in- 
formation just went to the phone book and tore it out." 

Fantasy Island. ' 'We also had a theory about Catalina. Ava- 
lon is a tiny town with a lot of mom and pop shops and busi- 
nesses. It's a lot like Disneyland; you can walk anywhere. It's 
the only town on the island, surrounded by farmland and con- 



! MSERVATIOHS: 599" 10 H 



servancy. We thought it would be an ideal testing place; and we 
had a system that could really promote the island." 

Island's first program was placed on the boat that ferries 
passengers from Newport to Catalina every day. The reliabili- 
ty of the Apple n was clearly demonstrated. 

"The system was running twenty-four hours a day from 
April to November — six months," Wauben says. "During that 
whole time we only had one technical problem." The system 
was down for three hours in the third month for a disk change. 
A glitch had developed. 

"The boat was anchored off the harbor. I had to go out in a 



68

dinghy to change the disk, having missed the scheduled 
docking. 

"You know, some disks are only guaranteed for forty hours. 
We had two in continuous use for three months each. And the 
run to Catalina is not the smoothest . . . the salt air, the motion 
of the boat, all the banging around when it's docking. That's 
quite a testimonial." 

The program on the ferry was a primitive version with the 
same advertising that it has now, but the screen just scrolled 
continuously and didn't give the viewer a chance to interact. 
"It was so boring, I don't know why the people just didn't throw 
it overboard," Wauben jokes. 

The Touch Screen was added when the system found a 
home on the Chamber's green pier. The program has been up-

dated since, with public service information interspersed with 
the ads. When Wauben created the program, he had flexibility 
for his advertisers in mind: rate, price, and date changes can 
be incorporated easily. 

As soon as more than the present forty-eight advertisers 
subscribe to the service, Wauben says he is going to start hunt- 
ing for a good two-megabyte hard disk to hold the program. 

Silent Partner. Although Island Services has its main of- 
fice in Avalon, Wauben does his programming in a little stuc- 
co house in Long Beach, California. Once a clamoring, oil-rich 
boomtown. Long Beach today is a contrast of futuristic re- 
fineries and palmy neighborhoods spotted with oil pumps, like 
lonely carnival rides, soundlessly churning up the last crude 
legacy of the dinosaurs. 

Island shares a corner lot with a pump named Berry Num- 
ber Five. 

In the silent seesawing shadow of the metal rig, Wauben 
adapts the computer-generated images of Island's program 
author, Spencer Pettit. He uses an Apple n, a graphics tablet, 
and E-Z Draw. On a deadline, he is chasing glitches through a 
Touch Screen presentation for a museum trade show. In this 
imaginary tour g^ide for the Philadelphia Museum, one touch 
gives you several screenfuls of information about a non- 
existent can opener exhibit; another touch brings you to a por- 
trait of Ben Franklin telling you where to dine in Philadelphia. 

"Museums are getting more involved with hands-on tech- 
nology these days," Wauben explains while he wrestles with a 
submenu, a new feature of the Touch Screen presentations. 
What is now a scroll of eateries will be a choice between, say, 
restaurants and nightclubs. 



"Museums and theme parks are an area we're heading in- 
to; less advertising and more pure information. It's informa- 
tion on demand; a lot more interactive, not just passively 
scrolling across the screen at a prechosen speed." 

As a computer graphics artist, Wauben keeps up on the 
latest developments in his field. PresTel, a system operating 
throughout France, England, and in some cities in Gtermany, 
impresses him. "Lots of color and nice graphics for computer 
banking, electronic mail, and databases with news, weather, 
and sports. 

"In Los Angeles, the Times Mirror company is testing a Ca- 
nadian-based news broadcast system called Telidon." This is 
basically a text service similar to the Source, and Wauben 
says Apple software is being used extensively for the graphics. 

Cousinly Kudos. "People's minds work in pictures," Wau- 
ben points out. "That's the challenge here, to make the picture 
tell the story and not get too involved with the words. Touch 
Screen displays are like international road signs. No matter 
what language is used, the graphics do most of the talking. 

"We had a visit recently from a cousin of mine who has an 
Apple dealership in Dusseldorf, Germany. He speaks just 
enough English and reads even less, but he had no trouble 
working and understanding the Catalina menu. 'Wunderbar! 
Wunderbar!' was all he could say. 

"I saw a Bell and Howell system at a trade show a while 
back. It had an Apple hooked up to a carousel slide projector; a 
real Rube Goldberg device. It was like having a mule pulling a 
tractor. Touch Screen displays eliminate this sort of hardware 
overkill." 

Island Services is actually one of a network of three com- 
panies working on touch television applications. An advertis- 
ing agency in Cleveland, Ohio, is working on industrial ver- 
sions that can replace traditional slide show demonstrations. 

High-Priced Lookers. "Some companies still pay up to $200 
each for super high-resolution slides. You can create about ten 
charts and graphs per hour on the Apple, and you have the 
ability to go back in and make quick changes on them," Wau- 
ben says. 

A programmer and an artist in Orlando, Florida, create 
touch television displays for hotels and malls. 

All three companies share the same origin. 

Wauben started working with computers in 1980 when he 
was a staff artist on the Orlando Sentinel. The Sentinel was cre- 
ating some programming on a $30,000 computer; the news- 
paper also had a couple of Apples. 

"We were working on an at-home television newspaper 
using Apple graphics software. I noticed the resolution was 
identical on both computer systems; then I compared the 
prices: $30,000 versus $3,100. It was clear how a small en- 
trepreneurship could grow out of all this. 

"Then I moved to California to develop a graphics branch 
for Island Services — ^then an accounting firm." Around the 
same time, some of Wauben's co-workers from the Sentinel be- 
gan setting up shop in Cleveland and Orlando. 

The Apple-touch television connection was being made. The 
future of interactive computering was in capable, creative 
hands. 

Spending his days punching out Liberty Bells, seagulls, 
boats, and can openers has fueled a dream of Wauben's: to 
open a computer graphics clip art service. ' 'A lot of people are 
going to have a need for this kind of graphics," he says, as the 
Philadelphia program gets a fuial run through, screen by 
screen. "This kind, and a lot of other art just like it." 

To do what you do best and earn a living doing it — the com- 
mercial artist's dream. For Wauben and company, interac- 
tive computering is turning out to be everjrthing it promised 
to be.

No matter how you slice it, the only way you're 
going to know if a data handling program is 
right for you is by running it on your computer, 
solving your problems, your way. 

And the only database management sys- 
tem (DBMS) that lets you do that is dBASE II™ 

A DBMS like the mainframers have. 

Conceptually, dBASE II is a relational 
database management system, like the system 
IBM introduced on their mainframes last year. 

Practically, dBASE II is the most powerful 
DBMS made for a micro. It handles multiple 
databases on a single drive and simplifies every- 
thing from accounting to project management 
to monitoring rainfall on the Upper Volta. 

With a word or two, you CREATE data- 
bases, APPEND new data instantly, UPDATE, 
MODIFY and REPLACE fields, records and 
entire databases. Organize months worth of data 
in minutes with the built-in REPORT. Do sub- 
field and multi-field searches, then DISPLAY 
some or all of the data for any conditions you 
want to apply. 

And you've just begun to tap the power 
of dBASE II. 

Easy to look at, easy to use. 

Input screens and output forms couldn't 
be easier— just "paint" your format on the CRT 
and what you see is what you'll get. 

You can do automatic calculations on 
fields, records and databases, accurate to 10 digits. 




And you can use dBASE II interactively 
for instant answers. Or save your instructions 
and automate your data handling with two words: 
DO Finances, DO Rainfall, DO whatever has 
to be done. 

Use dBASE II to help make your choice: 

Instead of asking you to pore over a 
manual, we'll let you try dBASE II free for 30 days. 

Send us $400 and we'll send you a copy 
of dBASE II that you can run on a 48k Apple with 



database system 
ting skinned 




CP/M ($700 for expanded hard-disk version). 
Put it through its paces. Then after 30 days, 
send it back and we'll return your money, no 
questions asked. 

But we don't get many back, because 
dBASE II is the one database management system 
that can really cut it.

Down on the Farm 

With i^ples 



DAVID mwm 



And the Lord smelled a sweet savour; and the Lord 
said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any 
more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart 
is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any 
more every thing living, as I have done. 

While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and 
cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and 
night shall not cease. 

—Genesis 8:21-22 

About ten thousand years ago, our Neolithic ancestors dis- 
covered agriculture. Before, for untold millenia, our species 
survived by hunting and gathering wild foodstuffs. How and 
when the shift occurred, from a hunter-gatherer society to an 
agricultiiral society, remains shrouded in the mists of ancient 
prehistory. 

A more significant shift in himian destiny has never oc- 
curred. Agriculture made it possible to support a much larger 
population than a hunter-gatherer society could. The world's 
population wouldn't have exceeded thirty million people had 
hvimans never progressed beyond the hunting and food-gath- 
ering stage; the earth's natural resources, unaided, can't sus- 
tain more. Qvilization with all its goods and evils emerged 
only when humanity had time to think and create. 

Despite floods, the ill wind of plagues, the destructive force 
of wars, and the words of prophets and poets, agriculture re- 
mains the most important force in every human's life. We all 
must eat, and the infrastructure that makes this possible 
permeates all societies and binds all the peoples of the world 
into one big hungry family. 

After the Seventh Day. Computer technology has contrib- 
uted greatly to the science of modem agfriculture — in genetic 
engineering, in weather forecasting, in mechanical engineer- 
ing, in analyzing production techniques, and in numerous other 
tasks lumped together under the title "farm management." 
Only a small fraction of the two million-plus farmers in the 
United States actually own computers, although many more 
are used to benefiting from this technology through universi- 
ties, co-ops, and government agencies. 

Farmers tend to be victimized by an outdated image of 
rural vacuousness, of superstition, of conservatism, yet they 
consistently disprove it. Arlene Martin is one of the modem 
breed, adapting to computer technology, displaying the inno- 
vative mettle farmers are rightfully famous for: if there's a 
better way to do a job, then you leam that new way. 

Arlene and Marion Martin own and operate a 380-acre farm 
in Webster Qty, Iowa. Despite fourteen inches of rain in the 
month of May, high interest rates, and the rising cost of feed, 
business is going smoothly as usual. 

Marion Martin and one part-time hired hand physically 
manage more than four hundred head of beef cattle and thirty- 
two sows. They grow corn and soybeans. Arlene Martin keeps 
the books, does the accounting, and files taxes for the farm. 
Their thirteen-year-old son helps on the farm part-time when 
he's not in school. 

A little more than a year ago, the Martins visited Beacon's 
Electronics in Ames, Iowa, in search of an Apple computer. 





Arlene Martin decided to become the "computer person" on 
the farm. 

"The reason we chose an Apple is because Iowa State Uni- 
versity in Ames highly recommended the brand," she 
explains. 

Updating farm operations in the past has meant buying the 
newest tractor or combine harvester, adapting the latest milk- 
ing techniques or seeding plans, and employing scientifically 
formulated space-age fertilizer. The Apple may be the newest 
implement that farmers cannot do without. "The potential is 
there, but several problems portend a slower adaptation than 
that to more familiar kinds of tools. Computers will arrive like 
the seasonal forces of nature, at a speed farmers are familiar 
with. 

The first problem is time. Farmers work hard all year, sev- 
en days a week, from before dawn to after sunset. The time re- 
quired for learning to use an Apple with packaged software 
may prove too costly. Many farmers would just as soon leave 
computers to the experts — universities and agricultural 
agencies. 

Cow's Eye Apple. Ken and Myraa Hertneky manage a herd 
of seventy dairy cows on a nineteen-hundred acre farm in Ra- 
mah, Colorado, about fifty miles east of Colorado Springs. In 



AUGUST 1982 



73 




the past they sent their individual cow and herd reports to the 
Dairy Herd Improvement association. 

"The reports would take two to three weeks to come back," 
explains Myrna Hertneky. "Farmers need that information 
right away." 

The Hertnekys bought their Apple almost a year ago, and in 
December they picked up Farmplan's dairy herd software 
package. With an Apple n and that one package, which in- 
cludes several programs, they can generate information al- 
most immediately. If a cow has fallen off in milk production, 
they don't have to wait two weeks to identify the culprit. 

Harvesting Software. This brings us to the second prob- 
lem — a scarcity of agricultural software. Until recently there 
was very little software available for the Apple to help the 
farmer, beyond accounting and database programs. Now that 
is changing; more than a dozen outlets, from universities to 
private companies, are marketing agricultural packages. 

Roy Hatt has been investigating feed supplement tech- 
niques for the National Research Foundation. Operating out of 
Taft, California, a hundred miles north of Los Angeles, in the 
guise of RLH Consulting, Hatt has found that some farmers — 
those who have had the time — are doing their own 
programming. 



"The TI programmable calculators were a good first gen- 
eration, but I think many fourth-generation programs on mi- 
cros are out there," Hatt says. 

Wisconsin Microware, AG-COM, Farmplan, Sigma Micro- 
computer Systems, Mcintosh Software, Harvester Computer 
Systems, and Oklahoma State University are just some of the 
current sources of agricultural software for the Apple. 

Mike Hoybook studied math and computer science at West 
Texas State before joining his father on the family farm in Sul- 
phur Springs, Texas. Hoybook worked with his father for two 
years managing a herd of one hundred dairy cows, then ac- 
quired his own farm where he now milks about forty out of a 
herd of sixty. He has authored a dairy management system 
and is currently marketing it through his company, Sigma Mi- 
crocomputer Systems. 

"I don't agree that time is going to keep farmers from 
learning to use computers. Sure they are awful busy. It's the 
same with anybody who has their own business. If you're inde- 
pendent, you find time," he explains. 

"When farmers find out what it is and what it can do, the 
computer will take hold." 

Above the Fruited Plain. Another problem, beyond the time 
factor and the perceived lack of software, is the current state 



74

of the national economy. The dairy industry, in particular, is in 
rough times. There is much talk of eliminating or greatly re- 
ducing government price supports. 

"The dairy industry is in trouble," Hoybook says. "Prices 
are going down. Most farmers are afraid to spend money right 
now. They would rather wait, let the other guy try a personal 
computer, and see if it catches on." 

Hoybook beheves that soon we may see a nationwide pro- 
duction base for the dairy industry. Farmers may suffer penal- 
ties for overproduction. There also may be more exporting of 
dairy products, and the world price for milk is much less than 
the price in the United States. 

"I believe milk has seen its highest price for a long time. 
Now more than ever, dairymen are going to have to cut 
comers," Hoybook explains. "Microcomputers help identify 
nonproducing cows faster. We see problems developing before 
they get too bad." 





forged ahead at a remarkable speed. The fantastical bovine 
creatures treated like gods in old Irish epics have almost come 
into being. Geneticists and breeders striving for years to cre- 
ate the perfect milking cow have made considerable headway. 

But along with the fabuloiis scientific progress has come 
the end of an era. The family farm may never completely dis- 
appear, but it's rapidly becoming an endangered species. 

Micro Milking in the Midwest. Dr. Art Stiennon learned 
computing and farming at the same time. His was not the way 
of son taking over from father, who had taken over from his 
father. Stiennon bought his first farm in southwestern Wiscon- 
sin in 1966. He bought his first computer in 1968. 

Today Stiennon operates a network of twenty-three farms 
totaling forty-five hundred acres in Dane County, Wisconsin.

— From the Irish epic Tain Bo Cuailnge 

There is no bigger business than agriculture. Its assets 
number in the hundreds of billions of dollars and gross re- 
ceipts dwarf even those of the oil industry. In this country 
alone, there are more than two million farms. Our founding fa- 
thers were farmers and considered agriculture a preeminent 
concern of the young United States. Since then, there has been 
no bigger force influencing agricultural development in this 
country than the government. 

In the last century and a half, agricultural sciences have 



one to take over, the farmer sells out and retires," Stiennon 
explains. 

"In the old days you could make a living off thirty cows; 
now it takes at least seventy cows. Most of the farms I've ac- 
quired are small, from one hundred to three hundred acres." 

Stiennon, with a strong mathematical background, taught 
himself to program on a PDP-8/L and eventually produced 
dozens of farm management programs. By 1980 he had more 
than two hundred fifty programs and realized he had some- 
thing worth marketing. Stiennon hired a programmer to con- 
vert his programs to the Apple and formed Wisconsin Micro- 
ware. The initial product from Stiennon 's company is The 
Agricultural Software Package, or Ag-Pac. 

The going price for Ag-Pac is rather steep. Nonetheless, the 
package, which is broken into four main sections, is quite com- 
plete for the diversified farmer. The financial management 
section includes programs for determining amortization costs, 
internal rate of returns, refinancing mortgages, and mort- 
gage balances. The crop enterprises portion of the package fo- 
cuses on cash grain production, profit matrix, pricing grain, 
crop sharing, blending wet and dry grain, trucking grain, 
hedging, and soybean spreads. 

Ag-Pac's livestock enterprises section features programs 
for feeder pig production, pasturing stockers, cow-calf opera- 
tions, breeding-herd taxes, dairy replacement heifer produc- 
tion, balanced least cost rations for dairy cows, and balanced 
least cost rations for beef cattle. The final fourth of the pack- 
age is called land investment, including Lee's land formula (a 
capital budgeting model for evaluating farm land acquisi- 
tions), population pressure, and population map. 

"Even a small dairy farm is big business. If you have sixty

cows at $1,500 each, more than $75,000 in milking and farming 
equipment, and $150,000 in land, that's already more than 
$300,000 needed in working capital," Stiennon says. "In such a 
substantial enterprise the cost for a computer and software is 
not great. Four large tractor wheels cost about $7,500." 

The Early Bird. In any farming community there are lead- 
ers. These brave individuals are the first to try a new tech- 
nique or technology, while the rest of the community watches 
to see what happens. Stiennon believes that computers are the 
focus of this phenomenon now. 

"One of the nice things about human beings is our natural 
tendency to be constantly optimizing," he says. 

The Hertnekys are community leaders. In the past when a 
new hay baler or swather came on the market, they were al- 
ways the first to try it. Lately, the Hertnekys' neighbors are 
wondering about Ken and Myma's Apple n. 

"Yes, it can help, if farmers learn how to utilize the com- 
puter properly," Myma Hertneky suggests. "Farmplan's pro- 
gram has been very easy to use. We've increased our milk pro- 
duction per cow from fifty pounds a day to between fifty-seven 
and fifty-eight pounds a day." 

Unlike the Martins of Webster Qty, Iowa, MjTTia is not the 
only computer person on the farm. "Ken has really taken an 
interest. He knows more about business than ever before," 
she says. 

The Hertnekys have worked their farm now for about twen- 
ty-eight years. Their daughter works part-time on the farm, 
along with Ken's parents. Their son is in college. 

"The price of milk is dropping. Hay has gone up. The price 
of grain is steady, if not down a little. Freight rates have 
stayed the same," Myrna explains. "The interest rate is 
what's really holding people down." 

The Land of Plenty. Across a mountain range, a few 
deserts, and some of the richest farm land in the world, is a 



new company with a product and a message. 

"Agriculture has traditionally been pampered, maybe too 
much, but, of course, that's been helpful to farmers." The 
speaker is Milo Tenney, president of Farmplan in Sunnyvale, 
CaUfomia. "Price supports and subsidies will continue to be 
cut. Agriculture has to stand more on its own feet." 

Tenney grew up on a dairy farm in Chandler, Arizona. He 
graduated from UtaJi State with a major in agricultural eco- 
nomics and a minor in computer science. Last June he filled 
the top spot at Farmplan, by virtue of his dual background. 

Working with a couple of programmers, Tenney developed 
a series of farm management products to market nationwide. 
In what is called the Farmplan Agent Program, district agents 
handle sales for areas of two or three states and local centers 
provide after-sale service. Tenney believes that personal com- 
puters are very definitely destined for a place on most Ameri- 
can farms. 

"In the relatively near future everybody is going to have 
one, like every serious farmer has a tractor. Farm computers 
will go the same route," Tenney predicts. "Better and better 
software is going to give farmers information in terms they 
can understand, even if they don't have any real computer 
expertise." 

Farmplan's Dairy Herd Management package basically 
keeps records and manipulates information. It is a decision 
aid, but not a decision maker. Tenney believes eventually 
there will be software programs that come close to reproduc- 
ing the sixth sense farmers spend generations acquiring. 

In the here and now, Tenney believes that some farmers 
are expecting too much from the computer. ' 'No. This is not a 
farm manager, but it could help a farmer make a little more 
profit. 

"Marketing decisions are very important. Market analysis 
and one good decision could pay for the computer overnight."

The adveyit of farming for profit instead of survival, 
destined as it was in the long run to lift many families out 
of lifetimes of drudgery and to cause many more yet to 
leave farming altogether, also ended neighborly interde- 
pendence, and set farmer against farmer in competition 
for each other's choice land. It also changed attitudes. 
For the first time, an entire class of farmers went to their 
bams each morning asking themselves, "How can I 
make more money out of this operation?" 

— Mark Kramer, from Three Farms 

Iowa Cornfed Microcomputing. The fine line dividing profit 
and survival gets thinner every day. Both motives are behind 
the efforts of Arlene Martin to learn programming. With her 
Apple in, Apple 11, Paper Tiger 560, and several existing pro- 
grams acquired from Successful Farming Magazine, this fifty- 
two-year-old woman finds the world of microcomputing 
fascinating. 

She has attended Iowa Central Community College for 
courses in programming and plans to get a degree. While her 



how many farmers will actually buy computers and use them. 
"It's more efficient to hire somebody else to do that kind of 
work. 

"All the expertise needed can't be in software. Farmers 
can't duplicate on their own the expertise practiced by local 
fertilizer dealers, for instance." 

Ralph Butterfield is an instructor for adult agriculture 
courses at Madison Public School, a small rural high school in 
central Minnesota. He's been teaching agriculture for twenty- 
five years and knows a lot about farmers. 

"I find that farmers are not really interested in learning 
data processing. They're vitally interested in that information 
but their time is worth more," Butterfield explains. "Farmers 
would rather turn it over to someone who knows that 
business." 

Still, Butterfield finds the implications of data processing 
coming to the farm staggering. The younger generation, he 
finds, is more appreciative of computer technology and is in a 
good position to acquire the proper training and skills. 

"Farmers will always depend indirectly on the skills of 






husband is busy running the farm and improvements are 
being made on the farmhouse, Arlene is busy learning Visi- 
Calc III. 

Traditional Yankee farmers in New England are charac- 
terized by a competitive yet neighborly demeanor. Next door 
neighbors fight the same weather, toil on the same ground, and 
compete in the same market. Iowa is no different from New 
England. Neighbors help each other when more than two peo- 
ple are needed for a task, like raising a bam, but when push 
comes to shove, it's every farm for itself. 

Just about everybody who received one of the early Apple 
His had problems, and Arlene was no exception. "Last sum- 
mer I wouldn't have given you a nickel for it. I got frustrated 
and nervous. Left it alone for a while." 

Fortunately, Arlene did not get too discouraged. When Ap- 
ple replaced the old HI with the new one that runs properly, 
things got better in a hurry. 

Benny Lane is a programmer with the Oklahoma State Uni- 
versity Division of Agriculture, which has released several 
programs for the Apple originally produced for the TRS-80 and 
IBM 370. Lane grew up in a farm community, enjoying the ex- 
periences of any farm kid. 

"Mess up once with computers and that sets you back a 
long way," he explains. "You'll get laughed out of the market. 
Someday micros may actually drive a tractor, but that tech- 
nology is two or three years away and about ten years away 
from being fully accepted. For the moment computers will 
only do tasks on the farm that farmers trust them to do." 

Least Cost Computer Rations. A farm management spe- 
cialist at Oklahoma State University, Ted R. Nelson wonders 



others, like accountants and lawyers," Butterfield explains. 
"But now sons are coming back from college with knowledge 
of computers and who knows what will happen next. Apples 
are a major catalyst that will help data processing on farms 
come about. In the long run, farmers will go wherever they can 
get help." 

Sowing the Seeds of the Future. The majority of living 
Americans know little about where their food comes from and 
have no part in its production. We take it for granted that there 
will always be eggs, bread, fresh vegetables, and mashed po- 
tatoes when we get hungry. In other parts of the world it's a dif- 
ferent story. 

Ten thousand years ago humans first planted seeds and 
harvested crops. They made sacrifices to gods and deities at 
seedtime and harvest time. We, in the most technically ad- 
vanced country in the world, still celebrate the rising of Jesus 
Christ from the dead around the time of spring planting. 

Ten thousand years from now, our descendants may look 
back and praise us for bringing computers to the farm. We will 
have helped forge their society, for better or worse. ^1

j^real need for a ^nide to the hnndrod.s of proj^rams that com|>etc 
for thi' A))ple owners dollars. W'Hh the introduction of the 280

thcrefiire. we dedicate tliis bot)k to yoti. the ccmsumer. We hope 
son w ill use it for a liuidc and as a reference to a-ssisi you in mak- 
ing intcili^ienl and infunncd decfsitms when purchasing software. 

(."nrrentK. tlic Apjilr Clomputcr owner is presented with a 
hcwildcrin^ selection nf softv^ arc from which to choose. On the 
otic hand, this shonid pk-a.se yuu in that, as the owner of probabh 
the most po|Hilar niicro-eompnlcr in the world, ytni have a wide 
and rapidly ^rnw in^ selection of softw are from w hich to choose. 
( )n the other hand, tliis wide and grow ing seieelion presents some 
problems. The \ ast majority of retail computer store staff people 
siniply jnst do not have the time to ade(iuatcly review each new 
piece of software that cfimes in their store. The problem is com- 
ponnded if the new program i.s an extensive or complicated one, 
such as an accounting package or a word processing system, or a 
comprehensive data base management program. This docs not 
nu'an that store persimnel do not w ant to give you the best service 
possible; it's just that it is an almast impossible task. If you pur- 
chase software through the mail, the risks that you assume, 
without a reliable guide to as.s)sl you should be apparent. 

Other pitfalls aw ait the uninformed buyer. For instance, in too 
man\ cases \ ou cannot by the appearance of the package whether 
the program re<iuires Integer Basic or Applesoft Basic or whether 
it needs 16. 32 or 48K of BAM. U Ls also often difficult to tell 
when you purcha.se a |irc>gram on tape whether it can be trans- 
ferred to disk or, if a disk program is purchased, whether it can 
he copied or not. 

Another area that can present problems to the buyel" is the 
similarity of software. A weU-stocked computer store may 
possibly offer five different word processing package, four 
assemblers, ten different adventure type games and/or several 
mail list programs, (the choices seem endless): all of which have 
olw ions advantages and disad\ antages as well as different prices. 

The goal of "The Book" is to eliminate as many of these poten- 
tial problem areas for the software buyer as possible. 

W e welcome any comments or criticisms from readers that wilt 
help us in reaching this goal.

The Schoolhouse Apple 

" bvJeanVarven 




On the opening day of Applefest in Boston this past May, 
the sign on the booth read simply: The Phoenix School. While 
the booth did generate some interest, the school's founders 
couldn't help feeling disappointed. Not nearly as many par- 
ents and kids as the organizers of the Phoenix School were ex- 
pecting stopped by that first day to get acquainted with what 
the school had to offer. 

Some Apple-owning residents of the Boston/Cambridge 
area did take the time to visit the booth to express regret that 
the school was so far away. Situated midway between Har- 
vard and MIT, the school is not named for its location. Rather, 
explains director and cofounder Larry Davidson, "The name is 
meant to suggest the idea of something new springing from the 
old." 

By the time the second day rolled around, says Davidson, a 
second line — an all-important clarifier — had been added to the 
sign. The addition read: Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

The Phoenix School is an independent coeducational school 
for students ages five to eighteen. One of the things that sets 
the school apart is its emphasis on integrating the computer in- 
to the education and lives of its students. 

The idea for this innovative school was bom in December of 
1980 out of dissatisfaction and frustration. At that time, David- 
son and two colleagues, Alison Birch and Brian Harvey, were 
teaching at Lincoln Sudbury regional high school. All tlu"ee felt 
unhappy about limitations the public school system imposes on 
learning and teaching and wished they could do something to 
create the kind of environment they felt would benefit stu- 
dents most. 

The learning environment Davidson, Birch, and Harvey en- 
visioned more than a year and a half ago had four primary at- 
tributes: small classes, attention to the individual needs of stu- 
dents, quality instruction, and the opportunity for students to 
be involved in the community. Computers, mostly Apple lis, 
came later, a natural outgrowth of the collective experiences 
the new faculty members brought with them, and a powerful 
means of establishing learning and teaching situations that 
were responsive to students' needs and interests. 

Double Screening. Before a student is accepted to attend the 
Phoenix School, parents and child take part in an interview 
with two members of the staff. Applicants are chosen based on 
an assessment of their academic and social readiness for the 
Phoenix School environment. The interview provides the op- 
portunity for the school's representatives to answer any ques- 
tions the family may have about the school and to review the 
applicant's educational history. Parents and child get a pic- 
ture of what the school offers, what a typical day might be like, 
and so on. 

Midway through the meeting, one teacher stays with the 
parents while the other accompanies the child to the computer 
center. While the parents learn more about the school through 
further conversation with a teacher, the child learns more by 
doing — by exploring the environment and the computer. Dav- 
idson remarks that, once students get started, it's usually hard 
to tear them away from the Apple when it's time to go home. 

But kids aren't the only ones who become intrigued by the 
computer. Parents are also eager to expand their world by 
learning to make the computer do their bidding. This past 
spring and summer. Phoenix School staff members conducted 
a variety of workshops especially intended to give individual 
attention to adults and children in the community who wanted 



to learn more about computers. 

Newcomers to computing were invited to experience a 
"gentle introduction to what computers are all about" in the 
form of a one-day workshop entitled "Demystifying Comput- 
ers." Through a combination of discussion, demonstration, 
and hands-on experience, participants discovered that they 
could indeed control the computer. Other offerings included in- 
tensive two-week workshops on Logo, Pascal, Lisp, and word 
processing on the Apple. 

Davidson reports that several parent/child teams attended 
the summer workshops. And although the school will not hold 
as many open workshops during the regular school year, the 
schedule does call for several workshops that will help parents 
keep up with what their kids are learning. 

Tight and Together. When school opens for the fall term on 
September 16, Davidson anticipates having about forty-five stu- 
dents enrolled. As planned, class size will be small — from eight 
to ten kids per class — making it possible for teachers to work 
closely with each student. And if things go as Davidson hopes 
they will, the ratio of students to computers will be 2 : 1. Since 50 
percent of students' work won't involve the use of computers, 
this ratio means that a computer should be available when- 
ever a student wishes to use one. 

Students in the lower grades will attend class from nine in 
the morning until two in the afternoon. They will be in differ-

ent groups for different subjects, depending on what is being 
taught. They will have regularly scheduled individual comput- 
er time in addition to using the computer in conjunction with 
their math work. In addition, the classroom experiences of 
these students will be supplemented by field trips that help 
bring the subjects they've learned about in school to life. 

A typical day for a high school student at the Phoenix 
School will be somewhat the reverse of the schedule for young- 
er students. High schoolers will spend their mornings outside 
the classroom, gathering experience and information they 
wouldn't be able to get within the school setting. Library work, 
field trips, and community internships are some of the ways 
these students will spend the first part of the day. According to 
Davidson, not all the internship opportunities have been ex- 
plored as yet, but possibilities include work in a hospital, at a 
local computer company, and at the children's museum; in- 
terning at WMBR (MIT's radio station) , with a political group, 
or with a member of the state legislature ; and helping to teach 
younger students at the Phoenix School. 

Formal classes for high school students will take place 
from 12: 30 to 5: 15. Rather than taking five or six classes at a 
time over a quarter or semester, high school students will 
study fewer subjects over shorter periods of time. This ar- 
rangement is meant to give them the chance to become really 
involved, to concentrate intently rather than having to spread 
their energies and attentiveness too thin. 

The large room that serves as the computer center will 
house twelve machines. The remaining computers will be scat- 
tered among the other classrooms. But, Davidson hastens to 
mention, no room will have just one computer. The standard is 
two or more in some classrooms, none at all in others. 

The reasoning that underlies this particular arrangement is 
simple but significant. Davidson and other educators see real 
value in the interaction that happens between students who are 
working side by side on computers. Whether they are learning 
about the same subject or not, kids working next to each other 
tend to show each other what they're doing, even to show off a 
little. And in the process of sharing their excitement and their 
frustrations, their knowledge and their questions, kids become 
more confident in themselves and their abilities to solve prob- 
lems using the computer. 

Little Big Job. Setting out to establish a small school, espe- 
cially one that will challenge and meet the needs of a broad 
range of students, is an ambitious undertaking. Davidson, 
Birch, and Harvey knew that one of their first and most im- 
portant tasks would be finding the right faculty members. 
They needed people whose experience and interests qualified 
them to teach more than one subject very well and to take on a 
variety of roles. The five full-time faculty members who will 
greet students this fall certainly seem to fill the bill. 

Alison Birch majored in math in college. Her experience in- 
cludes teaching math, computers, physics, and astronomy to 
high school students. Ellen Davidson, Larry's sister, is a for- 
mer education major; she has taught in elementary schools for 
two years in Appalachia and for nine years in New York. Dav- 
idson studied social science and has experience in helping peo- 
ple learn to work together cooperatively. 

In a departure from strict academics, the two women also 
plan to teach weaving, folk dancing, and the art of making 
stained glass. These opportunities to learn and enjoy the arts 
and pleasures of earlier times will help provide the students a 
balance to the computer-intensive curriculum. 

Anne Kramer's field of study was social science. Her pri- 
mary responsibility will be teaching elementary school stu- 
dents, and she is qualified to teach art and music to students in 
the upper grades. Rowland Russell studied math in college and 
has taught social studies and science, including biology and 
oceanography. In addition, Russell writes poetry and plays the 
dulcimer and will teach interested students to do both. 

Davidson's credentials include a bachelor's degree and the 
master's degree in linguistics, both from Harvard. He was 
chairman of the math department at lincoln-Sudbury regional 
high school and has taught English and math to high school 



A Programming Course For Beginners 



What is the best way to learn 
how to use an APPLE® com- 
puter? 

You could enroll in a class — 
arranged at someone else's con- 
venience, given by a technician 
who may not be a very good 
teacher. Or you could read a 
book — written by a program- 
mer who may not be a very 
good writer. Or you could learn 
in your own home, on your own 
APPLE®, at your own conven- 
ience, using the course that has 
become a standard ot the indus- 
try. 

Introducing 

THE NEW STEP BY STEP, 

a programming course for 

beginners 

In 1978, PDI introduced the 
original Step by Step. The stu- 
dent learned by interacting 
with his or her computer. Thou- 
sands of students learned how 
to use an APPLE® computer 
and the Applesoft® language 
with Step by Step. Now, using 
feedback from students, 
teachers and learning special- 
ists, we are introducing The 
New Step by Step. 

The New Step by Step, in 
addition to sound and effective 
teaching, includes computer 
graphics, animation, sound 
effects and a voice track. 

How does 

THE NEW STEP BY STEP s, 
woric? 

The computer program 
shows screen displays |s 




practice the material covered in 
the lesson. After the practice as- 
signment has been completed, 
the student takes a quiz. 

A final exam is included. 

What does 

THE NEW STEP BY STEP teach? 

There are about twenty hours 
of instruction. Topics covered 
include: 

• PRINT instruction 

• Writing simple programs 



INPUT 
Loops GOTO 
IF-THEN 

Program counters 

Library functions such as 
INT and RND 

Screen formatting, including 
TAB, VTAB and HTAB 

Subroutines 

READ-DATA statements 
FOR-NEXT loops 
One-dimensional arrays 
Nested loops 
Low-resolution graphics 
Multiple-statement lines 
Program logic 
Floating point notation 



or sample program 
outputs, while the 
audio cassette explains 
to the student what is 
being shown. After each 
instructional segment, 
the student is asked a 
question or asked to solve 
a problem. The computer 
checks the student's work. 

When a lesson has been com- 
pleted, the student turns off the 
cassette and goes to the Step by 
Step Workbook to review and 




How can 

THE NEW STEP BY STEP 
be used? 

Schools can use Step by Step for 
individualized instruction in 
programming in BASIC and in 
computer literacy programs. 

Families can use Step by Step to 
ensure that all family members 
can use the family computer. 

Businesses can use Step by Step 
to train their personnel. 

APPLE® dealers can use Step by 
Step to introduce prospective 
customers to the APPLE® 
computer.

students. Since September of 1980, he has worked at Logo-Com- 
puter Systems; he wrote the manual for the company's ver- 
sion of Logo. Come fall, Davidson will devote full time to the 
school. 

Writing Right. Students at all grade levels will be doing a lot 
of writing in all subjects, using the Apple and a word processing 
program. In keeping with the experiences other teachers have 
reported, Davidson finds that word processing makes a real 
difference — children, and people in general, develop signifi- 
cantly better writing skills when they're not bogged down by 
the mechanics of doing their assignments in longhand. 

The computer as a tool interests Davidson, as does the 
study of computer languages as languages. He has drawn on 
his lingtiistics background to work with students, computers, 
Logo, and Lisp in the study of English grammar. 

Studying grammar and lingtiistics on the computer in- 
volves formalizing one's knowledge of grammar. When you're 
attempting to generate sentences and translations on the com- 
puter, you must make things explicit in order to get the results 
you want. Davidson has found that using the computer in the 
study of grammar is one way of involving students whose pri- 
mary areas of interest have been math, science, and comput- 
ers rather than English. Approaching grammar from a differ- 
ent perspective — putting it in a different context — seems to 
make all the difference. 

A small private school offers special benefits to staff and 
students, along with new challenges. Students who have been 
accustomed to other kinds of school settings may have some 
adjustments to make. For this reason, the primary focus dur- 
ing the first two weeks at the Phoenix School will not be aca- 
demics. Instead, these days will be used for an intensive orien- 
tation period, a time when students get to know the school, the 
surrounding area, and one another. 

In a situation where students and staff work closely with 



one another every day, it's especially important that there be 
effective ways of working out whatever problems may arise. 
During the orientation period and throughout the year, stu- 
dents and staff will learn how to interrelate. Each student will 
have a faculty advisor who will remain the same throughout 
the student's tenure at the school, unless the student insists on 
a change. Advisors will be available to help students plan their 
coursework and to encourage their growth, academically and 
otherwise. 

Thrust and Query. In the process of teaching young people 
and adults about computers, Davidson has noticed some rath- 
er telling differences between the two groups of learners. 
While adults learning about computers tend to have more 
knowledge of the subject, they also tend to ask many more 
questions ahead of time than do their younger counterparts. 
Kids are generally much less hesitant, more willing to plunge 
ahead without worrying overmuch about breaking something 
or making a mistake. 

It would seem that the Phoenix School, with its emphasis on 
the computer as a problem solving tool and its attentiveness to 
individual needs, is one place where learners of all ages will be 
free to explore and to flourish. 

With Reference to Educational Computing. If you're trying 
to sort out who does what in education and where you should be 
when during the coming year, you may want to obtain a copy 
of the Classroom Computer News 1983 Directory of Education- 
al Computing Resources. This new book, published by Inten- 
tional Educations, becomes available in August. The direc- 
tory includes information about educational computing re- 
sources, periodicals, and professional associations, and a cal- 
endar of national and regional educational computing events.

Businessmen 

Q. Do you have difficulty operating your printer when 
connected to a time-sharing computer? Are files 
you're trying to download too large for your system 
buffer? Does your host computer lose data when you 
send files to it? 

A. "The Professionals" incorporate printer ring buffers 
which allow slower printers to accept data at their 
own rates. Very large files are easily received by 
periodically saving the buffer to disk. Unlike some 
software which can lose data during disk saves, 
"The Professionals" not only direct the host to stop, 
but actually wait for it to respond before performing 
the save. After a successful save, the host is 
automatically directed to continue. This process 
may be repeated indefinitely. Lost data during send 
is virtually eliminated by the widest variety of send 
options available in any communications software. 
"The Professionals" ensure fast, reliable data trans- 
fer of any valuable business information. 



Authors 



Does your line of work involve sending written 
material to others? Are you a program author who 
would like to send work in progress to a partner or 
client and know that it arrived intact? What would 
the ability to instantly send material or programs to 
anyone at any time be worth to you? 

"The Professionals" provide the ideal way to send 
your articles, manuscripts, reports, programs and 
technical documents to another computer with 
phone line access. Now you can work WHEREVER 
you want, and be assured that your data is sent to its 
destination quickly and error-free. In fact, compared 
to the fastest mail services, "The Professionals" of- 
fer immediate delivery and will save you the pur- 
chase price in just a few uses. 



Students 



Q. Are you bothered by limited access to your school's 
existing terminals? Would you like to be able to do 
your school assignments at home at your own con- 
venience? 

A. "The Professionals" allow you to access virtually 
any dial-up school or college computer system over 
standard telephone lines. This means no more 
waiting in line for an available terminal or hassles 
with malfunctioning school equipment. You can 
even prepare term papers or reports while off-line 
and send the completed work to the school com- 
puter for final printing. Best of all, you can work from 
home at the times most convenient for you. 



Time Share Users 

Q. Are you tired of wasting time and money sending or 
receiving files with inadequate, poorly designed 
software? Do you find yourself manually performing 
the same lengthy log-in procedures over and over 
again? Would you like to automate these procedures 
for yourself and others? 

A. "The Professionals" allow you to send files which 
have been prepared in advance. They may then be 
transferred at any time, as quickly as possible — 
even to several different systems. No time is 
wasted reviewing information while on line; data may 
be captured by your computer or printer (or both) to 
be evaluated later at your convenience. These fea- 
tures assure minimum on-line time and therefore 
minimum on-line cost. 

"The Professionals" introduce macros that are more 
sophisticated than anything previously seen in com- 
munications software. These "hand-shaking" mac- 
ros allow you to perform complete multi-stage log-on 
sequences automatically; all you do is specify the 
system to be called. This eliminates sign-on errors 
and greatly simplifies operation of the entire system, 
not only for you, but for other less skilled operators. 

Bulletin Boards 

Q. Would you like to be able to take advantage of the in- 
formation featured on local bulletin boards and infor- 
mation services such as The Source, CompuServe, 
Dow Jones, and others? 

A. "The Professionals" open the world of modem com- 
munication networks to you. There are already 
thousands of these systems and networks in use na- 
tionwide. "The Professionals" provide an ideal way 
of accessing these systems. All 80 column boards, 
external terminals (even the 40 column screen), and 
currently available communications devices are fully 
supported, including the Hayes Micromodem II and 
Novation Apple CAT. All standard baud rates — 110, 
300, 1200 and others — are fully supported; BAUDOT 
too, if your computer is equipped with the Apple CAT 
modem. 



Clubs 



Q. Are there other Apple owners with whom you would 
like to exchange programs or files, but have been 
unable to do so because of limitations imposed by 
the software you now use? 

A. Any two Apples equipped with "The Professionals" 
can transfer ANY type or size file with complete error 
checking and correction. All of "The Professional" 
packages are fully conversant with each other and 
operate almost identically. For the first time ever, 
you can transfer compatible files to an operating 
system different from yours — error free!

Now you know the bad news. The good news is that Roger Wagner's Assembly Lines: The Book is 
hotter than a photon torpedo. 

Wagner takes your Apple's 6502 on a mission of fourteen chapters and five appendixes. You and 
your computer will boldly go into a universe of loops, counters, branches, addressing modes, and 
sound generation routines. 

"With time and practice you will develop your own skills at creating efficient machine language 

routines, but that process con be assisted by examining the techniques that others have de- 
veloped in previous programming efforts," writes Wagner. 

"I have tried in this book to provide a reasonable mix of programming techniques, along with the 
usual ration of new commands." 

$19.95 gets you more than 270 pages of graphs, listings, and exercises. Written in a style 

Wagner had fifteen months to polish in the pages of Softalk, Assembly Lines: The Book is a must 
for anyone serious about trekking through the universe of machine language programming on

TASC The Applesoft Compiler. 
It turns your Apple into 
a power tool. 



Step up to speed. TASC, the Applesoft Compiler, 
converts a standard Applesoft BASIC program 
into super-fast machine code. By 
increasing program execution speed 
up to 20 times, Microsoft gives 
you a power tool for Applesoft 
BASIC programming. 
Highest capacity available. 
TASC will compile and run 
larger programs than any 
other Applesoft Compiler As a 
disk-based system, it doesn't 
require the simultaneous pres- 
ence of compiler and program 
in memory. The memory you save 
allows you to compile significantly 
bigger programs. 

Power without bulk. Code expansion of up to 100% 
severely restricts other compilers. TASC's special 
code compression schemes typically limit code 
expansion to only 25%. You'll really appreciate that 
with complex programs or programs that utilize 
Apple's hi-res graphic pages. 
More BASIC power. TASC's powerful new 
commands increase Applesoft BASIC programming 
capability. Chain with COMMON allows compiled 
programs to share variables, so a main menu 

'Applesoft IS a trademark of Apple Computer, Inc. 




supports several programs in a 
single runtime environment. 
^ TASC's True Integer Arithmetic 
and Integer FOR... NEXT 
capabilities maximize the execu- 
tion speed of compiled programs. 
TASC's near total compatibility 

with Applesoft speeds compil- 
ation of existing programs 
with little or no modification. 
What about mistakes? You 
perfect your programs inter- 
actively with Applesoft. If some- 
thing does slip by TASC recovers 
from errors discovered in compilation 
and traps all runtime errors. It even permits 
graceful interruptions during compilation. 
See for yourself. Ask for a demonstration of

SCREEN WRITER II is, frankly, the kind of word processor you would have 
developed for yourself if you were a programmer: strictly professional in its features, 
yet simple enough for even a beginner. And that's where we started. 

Sure, SCREEN WRITER gives you boldface, underiine, global search/replace and form letter capabilities. Of course, it 
lets you eliminate the boredom of retyping redundant text. Certainly, it lets you generate up to four indices, has complete 
formatting capability as well as full editing of any DOS 3.3 text or binary (including APPLESOFT programs) . . . and many 
other wanted features. 

That's enough to make SCREEN WRITER a very good value in word processors. But, we wanted to make it the best 
value. And we did . . . by eliminating the need for you to spend hundreds of dollars extra for supportive hardware! SCREEN 
WRITER is the onty word processor to offer tme software based lower case, a 70 column screen and printer spooling* which 
allows you to edit while printing, for more efficiency. 

With these extra, money-saving features at no extra charge, we think you'll agree, SCREEN WRITER is the best value in 
word processors today. And it's yours at $ 1 29.95. WAIT! It becomes an even better value if you buy our SCREEN WRITER 
PROFESSIONAL package. Then you get the SCREEN WRITER and our $99.95 DIC TIO NARY (described on the opposite 
page) for just $199.95! 

*Printer spooling feature only available for the following printer interface cards: APPLE parallel, SSM AlO parallel or serial, EPSON APL, Centronics parallel 
and the Grappler. SCREEN WRITER II runs on any 48K APPLE II/II Plus with DOS 3.3, and is available now at your local computer store, or directly ft'om . . .

Saves you from creative speling 



No matter how good your 
Apple's word processor, the 
user is human. So, the odds are 
that spelling mistakes will 
occur in almost every letter, 
document, or proposal. Many 
errors will be caused by those 
who never won a spelling-bee 
and are addicted to 'creative' 
spelling. . .while others will be 
due to keystroke 'typos'. Either 
way, spelling errors can be em- 
barrassing to you — to your 
image — to your business. 

DIC-TIO-NARY 
solves the spelling 
problem for you, 
and does it at com- 
puter speed, easily 
and almost effort- 
lessly. How easily, 
how effortlessly? 
Well, with DIC- 
TIO-NARY you 
have the option to 
correct a word 
immediately . . . 

right at the time you're doing the spelling check. No 
waiting necessary. And if, by chance, you don't know 
the correct spelling of the word, you can go into the 
wordbook right then and there and have it displayed for 
you! (Ask for these features on competitive programs, 
no matter their price, and see how fast they change the 
subject.) We think you'll find that for helpfulness our 
DIC-TIO-NARY is on par with having your favorite 
English teacher or even Mr. Webster at your elbow! 

words, words, words 

The DIC-TIO-NARY starts you off with more words 
than you'll probably ever need: 25,000 of the words used 
most often. Plus it lets you add 3000 words of your own 
choosing, so you can customize it to your specific 
needs. (By making back-up "wordbooks" you could 
have many additional lists of 3000 words!) 

how it works 

In simplest form, the DIC-TIO-NARY races through 
your document at a 2+ page-per-minute speed. It looks 
at every word in your text. At the same time it compares 
each word with those in its 28,000 wordbook . . . checking 
for any misspelling. When it catches a goof, you get to 
see the word as it was used in your text, on the screen. 
The DIC-TIO-NARY then asks how you want that par- 
ticular word handled. 



choices, choices 

The DIC-TIO-NARY will dis- 
play for you any word not listed 
in its wordbook and any mis- 
spelled word. It then offers you 
a choice of word-editing op- 
tions. For example: You may 
decide to ignore the word. You 
may have it marked in your text 
and /or on the printout, for later 
identification, correction or 
replacement. You may have the 
word automatically added to 
your wordbook. Or, you may 
immediately correct the spell- 
ing (using the 
wordbook for ver- 
ification, if de- 
sired) . . . and all 
occurrences of 
that word will 
automatically be 
corrected through- 
out your text, keep- 
ing the original 
capitalizations or 
lower case letters! 



extras, extras 

For ease of use, for efficiency and true proofreading 
effectiveness the DIC-TIO-NARY provides you with 
many other useful goodies. You may add or delete in- 
dividual words from the wordbook. . .or do the same 
with an entire list of words. You may have any portion 
of the wordbook listed, and may search it even while 
processing documents. When you add it up, you'll find 
you can't get our total combination of features in any 
other spelling program at any price. 

All in all our DIC-TIO-NARY may well be the most 
valuable and useful program since the little red school- 
house disappeared. Yet, you can enjoy all its benefits 
for only $99.95. If you buy our special Screen Writer 
Professional, you get the $129.95 SCREEN WRITER II 
word processor described on the left, plus The DIC-TIO- 
NARY, at the package price of $199.95. Be creative! Save 
$29.95! 

DIC-TIO-NARY works with Screen Writer II, Super- 
Scribe II, Apple Pie and Apple Writer. Requires 48K

Summertime Apples: one more time. This month's software 
festival continues in the glorious tradition of last month, with 
more programs than you could possibly use in a single season, 
all presented for your consideration and evaluated for your 
computing pleasure — before you have to go back to school and 
back to work, and we go back to normal. 

DataFax. By Curt A. Bianchi and Rudi Diezmann. DataFax is 
a very interesting and powerful concept in database program- 
ming. The program is written in Pascal and designed to be a 
freeform, relational filing system that can keep track of un- 
structured information. The program requires two disk drives 
and a language or RAM card to function, but you need not have 
the Pascal system itself, as all the files needed are on the Data- 
Fax program disk. 

The program can use any printer interface and eighty-col- 
umn card normally compatible with Pascal. Because of its de- 
sign, the program can be up and running as fast as you can get 
the disk into the drive. There is no setup required before you 
can begin. With most databases, the time involved in design- 
ing the storage format is itself a deterrent to using the pro- 
gram. It may also be necessary to redesign the format and in- 
put scheme for each new project you undertake, making an ed- 
ucated guess as to how many spaces should be allowed to 
handle each item of information and then designing a screen 
format to accommodate it. The titles and the information that 
your file contains are then set and not easily changed. 

Problems also arise if you forget something in your origi- 
nal layout or find you need to define larger spaces to hold your 
information. This usually means starting over and in many 
cases transferring information from the old configuration to 
the new — a job that could mean putting the whole thing off to 
another day. 

Now if you're wondering how they automated all of this, they 
didn't! They threw out the formatting altogether so that you 
only type in the information itself. When a disk fills you go to 
the next one; the system can expand onto a hard disk at any 
time and can do anything an office filing system can do except 
lose things. The method of finding things is a system of keys 
that you define. While entering the data you can choose any 
word or group of words to be the keys. There may be as many 
keys to a file as you want. You might choose a person's name, 
an address, a city or anything that has meaning to you. It is not 
necessary for the key to be part of the record. You can also set 
auto keys which are added to each folder you begin or edit 
while they are in force. 

The editing-data entry mode has a comprehensive set of 
cursor move commands utilizing the control key that give you 
a very complete screen-based text editor. If any of the com- 
mands conflict with your system commands, it is a simple 
matter to assign the command to another key. 

When it comes time to print your information, there are 
nine print options that control the format of the folders you 
print. You can also choose to print a folder or group of folders 
to a disk file, and in that way move a sorted selection of infor- 
mation into another database. 

The retrieval of information is as straightforward as the in- 
put. You tell the program the keys you want to find, and it 
shows you a list of all the folders that were saved using that 
key. There is also the ability to do a search using more than 
one key at a time. When using multiple keys you simply insert 
the words and or or between them, and the program makes the 
appropriate search. The and command brings forth folders 



containing both keys, and the or command will bring you the 
folders containing any one of the keys. 

If you are a form junkie and just have to have one, the 
means exist — but after using the program for a while your 
craving should abate. 

You can also extract information from your database and 
place it onto a text disk. From there it can be merged into an- 
other database or edited with a word processor. It is also pos- 
sible to transfer files to another system by using DataLink , a 
Pascal-based terminal program. In short, your information is 
not locked into this program but can be moved about and used 
as you like. 

Invariably, the most appreciated feature of this program is 
its ability to make a new idea become a functioning database 
in a very few minutes. 

Error handling is very straightforward. If you attempt to 
give it a command that is not applicable, it beeps and prints 
out a definitive error message at the screen bottom. A nice 
touch is that the message stays there until you hit the space 
bar so that you have time to read the message and decide what 
steps need be taken. The manual has a complete glossary of all 
the error messages and instructions on how to deal with 
each one. 

The manual included in the current package is a tempo- 
rary version; the final manual and an updated program disk 
will be sent at no charge to all registered owners.

GraForth. By Paul Lutus. This is a strange and wonderful 
mixture of contradictions — an instrument of awesome power 
and irritating quirks. It's a "graphics language" — a language 
that makes your Apple think in pictures instead of words. 

Any computer language is a set of rules and rituals for 
manipulating data for some particular purpose : the purpose of 
Basic is to be like human language, the purpose of Pascal is to 
be fast and orderly, and so on. The purpose of GraForth is, 
literally, to think in pictures; that is, to organize data in ways 
that correspond to the mechanics of human visual perception, 
manipulating the dots on the display screen to represent a va- 
riety of images rather than a standard set of characters in the 
form of letters and numbers. This makes it possible to do 
image manipulations of a speed and complexity that you 
wouldn't normally expect from an eight-bit, one megahertz mi- 
croprocessor. 

You still have letters and numbers, of course, even though 
the system "thinks" of them as visual images. What's the dif- 
ference? The characters are sent to the text screen memory 
area in the usual way, but that area is not displayed. Instead, 
using that area as a template, GraForth re-creates the in- 
formation on one of the hi-res screens, using character images 
from its own library. Then the hi-res screen is displayed. 

From the user's viewpoint, there may be no difference at 
all (except for an odd rippling effect when the display scrolls) 
if all the default values are in effect. But you can, if you wish, 
have a display in mixed upper and lower case or in a different 
typeface (four special fonts come with the system, including 
Slant and Gothic; you can also design your own). Headlines 
are in double-sized characters (or larger) — and all of this is on 
one screen, in several colors. 

And you haven't even come to the pictures yet.

GmForth offers four different drawing modes: simple 
line graphics, turtle graphics, character animation (not Don- 
ald and Mickey; characters like A, B, C and 1, 2, 3) , and the big 
one — three-dimensional image manipulation. 

Simple line drawing is done with a set of commands that 
operate the familiar Apple hi-res drawing routines. But the 
GraForth commands are image-oriented, a noticeable im- 
provement over the machine-oriented Apple routines. In Gra- 
Forth, you can plot or unplot (erase) any point on the screen; 
draw or erase a line between any two points ; or create or erase 
a solid rectangle by specifying two opposite comers. All of this 
can be done in any of the four hi-res colors, called orange, blue, 
green, and violet. 

In turtle graphics you draw by directing an imaginary tur- 
tle who draws a Une as it moves. Thus you can specify start- 
ing point, direction, length, and color of the line. Directions can 
be specified relative to the screen's X and Y axes or relative to 
the turtle's current orientation. To draw a square fifty pixels 
on a side, you simply say 50 move 90 turn in a four-time loop. 

Character animation makes use of the system's ability to 
create special character sets. You can design an image and 
then have the system break it down into character-sized 
chunks and store them as elements of a special character set. 
Then whenever you want to display that image you switch to 
the special character set and display that block of characters. 
Because the system can juggle characters very fast, you can 
get animation effects by switching rapidly between blocks of 
characters. This ought to be useful to game designers. 

And so we come to the main attraction: animated 3-D 
graphics. You can control up to sixteen different three-dimen- 
sional images at one time, each moving in a different pattern 
at different speeds. An image can move about on the screen, 
rotate on one or more of its axes, expand or contract (or both 
simultaneously, getting taller and thinner or shorter and 
wider), shift its apparent perspective, and more. 

The essence of the idea is that the system maintains a table

Apple IS a registered 



of parameters for each image. It alternates between the hi-res 
screens, displaying one while it redraws the images on the 
other, using parameters from the tables. Then it updates the 
table for each object according to the movement pattern you 
specify, and finally it switches screens and repeats the proc- 
ess — all in a fraction of a second. 

The results have to be seen to be believed. 

And one more thing: the system also makes music. You se- 
lect one of nine voices (actually duty cycles of the audio signal, 
from 0 to 50 percent) and then specify pitch and duration for 
each note. The speaker in your Apple is not very "musical"; 
but if you connect the output through your stereo system (see 
the Apple II Reference Manual), you will have a primitive 
music synthesizer. 

GraForth includes the word note, but not the word rest, 
so there's a one-tenth second delay you can use. It's called dsec 
(for decisecond), defined as: DSEC 0 DO 1026 0 DO LOOP 
LOOP ; and used in the form N dsec where N is in tenths of sec- 
onds. 

So, GraForth can draw pictures in several different ways 
and even make music. For fast, complex graphics work on an 
Apple, it is quite possibly the best instrument available. 

It is not Intended to be a general-purpose programming lan- 
guage. GraForth is a hybrid of Standard Forth and Applesoft. 
It uses Apple DOS (slightly modified) and many Applesoft 
commands (such as peek, vtab, left$) , but usually with Forth 
logic and syntax. It also has a few quirks of its very own. This 
makes it difficult to learn, since the new stuff keeps getting 
confused with what you already know — some of which applies 
and some of which doesn't. 

GraForth has other shortcomings, too: string handling is 
awkward, and arrays are not even mentioned in the manual, 
though you can get around most of that. This language, like 
Standard Forth, is extensible: you can modify it by adding 
your own commands. 

In short, GraForth is not the language for a program to 
decode cryptograms or balance your checkbook. But if you 
want to write programs that mix upper and lower case with- 
out special hardware, simulate the view from an observation 
ship out near Satiun, or create an anatomy text that lets the 
user change viewpoint around Inside a model of a living 
body, or if you want to write a game — this is the language of 
choice. IR

Galactic Gladiators. By Tom Reamy. 

Ed: Amazing! Just amazing! Why, I bet that this game 
combines the good parts of absolutely every other computer 
war game, all the simulations, and all the role-playing games 
available on the Apple market! 

Johnny: Not so, silicon breath! In Galactic Gladiators there 
are no hi-res cows. 

That, in all fairness to our poor eternal straightman, is 
about all that Galactic Gladiators lacks. One of SSI's Rapid 
Fire series, it borrows from the fantasy role-playing genre, the 
adventure genre, and the strategic war game genre and com- 
bines them with a surprising speed of execution. This quality 
apparently inspired a comparison to arcade games in the 
minds of their ad agency, but don't let that fool you. This is not 
a fast reflex game in any way. The most common failing of 
most complex strategic games is the waiting involved, es- 
pecially when you are playing against the computer. This is 
where the speed comes in; though it may be more challenging 
to play ag'ainst another hirnian (and possibly more fun, if you 
like to exchange martial epithets such as "Die, you mutant 
pig"), even the computer player is capable of making quick 
and reasonably intelligent moves. 

So many scenarios and game options are available that it is 
hard to know where to begin. The prospective player, how- 
ever, should begin with the manual. It is well-written and often 
amusing. Read the first five pages once and you should have a 
good grasp of how to play the game. Then set it aside to use as 
a reference and play the "Brawl at Cosmic Mike's Place" see-

nario. This is a good one for beginners because it is played on a 
close range field with only three warriors on a side. 

Each warrior has four characteristics that determine his 
order of movement and attack and his chances of hitting and 
being hit: strength, dexterity, endurance, and speed. In addi- 
tion, there are experience and weapon skills, which change 
with time and determine surprise and hit probability. It is use- 
ful to take advantage of the game's team saving feature, which 
allows these last characteristics to be maintained and built up 
from game to game. 

In any game there are two teams. One is played by a 
human and the other by the computer or another human. A 
really beautiful feature is that a person can leave or join a 
game in the middle, because you can change between two- 
player and player-computer mode at any time. Anyway, these 
teams can be set up evenly or with an advantage for one play- 
er, depending on the players' experience. 

A variety of weapons are available. Each warrior carries 
two to start with. Some of these, like the gemstone, a guided 
missile weapon, can only be used once. Some have to be re- 
loaded each time they are used, such as the phasors. The hand 
weapons can be used every turn, but cannot cover distances. If 
you change weapons or reload, you can't do anything else in 
that turn, so don't get caught with your pants down. 

You can choose an elimination game, or a game with one 
player defending against the other, or one with certEiin definite 
goals, depending on the scenario. Battlefields can be random- 
ly created or totally self-designed, wide open or filled with ob- 
stacles, indoors with rooms, outdoors with rocks and trees, or 
mazeUke — and in any of three sizes. Don't underestimate the 
effect of battlefield variables on the game strategy; a smaller 
field or one heavily packed with obstacles can give advantage 
to warriors with hand weapons ; a more open one can throw the 
battle in favor of those with phasors. 

In addition to eleven imaginative and varied scenarios that 
come with the game, the manual suggests setting up quests, 
which are defined as a series of battles on different battle- 



fields pitting one team against different enemy teams. The se- 
ries is held together by a quest description and a set of battle 
descriptions which give a raison d'etre to the carnage and ex- 
tend Galactic Gladiators deeper into the realm of the fantasy 
role-playing game. Three sample quests are supplied in the 
documentation, but they encourage you to develop your own. If 
you come up with a really good one, you can send it to SSI and 
they may publish it on a Galactic Gladiators data disk planned 
for release later this year. 

Galactic Gladiators is, simply, a masterpiece. With all its 
complexity, it isn't at all overwhelming (except in the good 
sense) , and it will continue to be interesting when your other 
game disks are gathering dust on the shelf. DD

VislTran. By Bruce Wallace. If you are writing, or are con- 
sidering writing, a program that will generate values or num- 
bers that you would like to analyze in a VisiCalc file, your cur- 
rent options are to enter these values manually into VisiCalc or 
to write your own conversation program to change your values 
to VisiCalc format. VisiTran might be an answer to your 
problem. 

It is important to note that this is really a program to be 
used by Applesoft Basic programmers. The operation is fairly 
easy. You load your file into VisiCalc and enter special Visi- 
Tran variable indicators (labels preceded by ®) in the cells in 
which you want your information entered, and save the file. 
You then run the VisiTran program, specif jdng VisiCalc file 
name, XFER (transfer) file name, Basic exec file name, and 
beginning subroutine line number. 

VisiTran then creates a Basic exec file that contains the 
subroutine that you will use in your Applesoft program to 
transfer data from your program to VisiCalc. When your pro- 
gram executes this subroutine, it opens the XFER file you 
specified and enters the variables to be transferred. To com- 
plete the transfer, you boot VisiCalc, load your original file, 
and then load the XFER file. The information from your pro- 
gram is now included in the VisiCalc file. 

This program allows transfer of integer, string, real vari- 
ables, and one and two-dimensional arrays. If you aren't an 
Applesoft programmer, this program may not be for you. But 
if you are learning or already programming in Applesoft, Visi- 
Tran could save you hours of time and trouble. 

The program disk comes with an eight-page manual that 
explains the operation of VisiTran. IS

Forth-79. By Anita Anderson, Martin Tracy, and Philip Was- 
son. Forth is fascinating! It's difficult to get into at first be- 
cause you have to learn some strange thinking habits ; but once 
you get over that threshold, you're hooked! It gives you such 
power, and such elegance of logic, that you will have trouble 
turning off the Apple and descending into reality again. 

Forth is a computer language — in the broadest sense ; a set 
of rules and rituals for operating a computer. But it can also be 
a "logic language," a means of expressing logical thought in 
symbolic form. That is what makes it so powerful: you can 
write your program as a series of logical structures and the 
computer will execute that logic directly. 

You can do that with Basic, you say? Not quite. With Basic 
you have to take the logical structure of your program, break it 
down into Basic instructions, and then enter those instruc- 
tions. This is often the most tiresome part of programming 
in Basic. 

Forth avoids this problem in two ways. First, the logic lan- 
guage in which you define your program is the same as the 
computer language with which you input it to the Apple — no 
translation is needed. Second, that language includes rules for 
extending itself by adding new definitions ; so if you need a log- 
ical operator that isn't already included, you can add it your- 
self. It will immediately become a part of the language and 
will be available for your use from then on. 

In Forth, a program (they call it an application) is imple-

mented in a hierarchy of subroutines. The simplest subrou- 
tines — they're called words — are things like, "Take the top 
word off the stack and print it." Then you write more complex 
words, building their definitions out of the simple words, and 
finally you have all the words you need to define a sort of ulti- 
mate word that is the complete application. When you execute 
that word, it calls its definitions, they call their definitions, and 
the program is running! 

Charles Moore, the inventor of Forth, designed clever ways 
to link these subroutines together. Without going into details 
here, the end result is faster run-time speed and better mem- 
ory economy than anything north of assembly language! 

Forth-79 is based on International Standard Forth (1980) , 
but not limited to it. Using the natural extensibility of the lan- 
guage, MicroMotion has added several extras: a complete 
string-handling package, a set of thirteen/sixteen-sector rou- 
tines (either way) , and a bunch of other handy utilities. They 
also provide a screen-oriented editing program of great 
power — it supports twenty-seven different commands, none of 
them trivial; and in case you're used to a different system, 
they give you a Forth word that will relabel all the editor com- 
mands to your taste. 

A second disk, available at extra cost, contains a complete 
add-on package of floating-point arithmetic (thirty-two-bit) . It 
also includes trig functions (including hyperbolic), exponen- 
tial notation, natural logarithms, and more. And as if that 
weren't enough, the disk also has a high-speed turtle graphics 
package. These routines operate on the hi-res image in memo- 
ry, at speeds comparable to an assembly language memory 
move — faster, in many cases, than the human eye can follow. 

Best of all, you can include any or all or none of this stuff in 
your own programs. If your application requires any of these 
features, just load the proper screens from the disk and those 
features will become part of the dictionary for your particular 
application. When you save the dictionary, those features will 
be saved as part of it. 

There is one small problem amidst all this power and ele- 



gance: the documentation is less than perfect. The system 
comes with a 200-page tutorial and reference manual, which is 
packed with useful information, but it's not as well organized 
as one could wish, and it lacks an index. All the necessary in- 
formation is there, but you sometimes have to hunt for it. 

Some of the features described in the book are part of the 
boot-up dictionary, and so are always available. But others, 
like the string handling routines, have to be loaded separately 
after booting, and the book doesn't always make clear which is 
which. 

MicroMotion is working on a revised edition of the manual, 
which should solve most of the problems. 

Warning: Forth is not for beginners. You need to have some 
of the thinking habits of a programmer before you start or 
Forth will drive you up the wall. But if you can work nested 
loops in Basic without getting your tongue tangled and find 
your way around in a two-dimensional array — and if you en- 
joy solving puzzles — you shouldn't have any real trouble 
with it. 

So if you're bored with Basic, and if assembly language 
seems like more trouble than it's worth — go Forth! ID

the end of a dark passage. A bone-thin wolf pulls himself to at-

give it a shot, is unique to this series. This, and the loyalty of

you. are the delights that make the Swordthrust adventures 
imperative for any benevolent adventurer's library. 

But making friends is not the only delight this unique series 
has to offer. The locales, the plots, the puzzles, and even the 
form of play are enjoyable. 

The Swoi-dtht-usts are adventures. The Swordthrusts are 
role-playing fantasies. No mistake, they're both. At the start, 
it's as if you're entering a great castle courtyard; you sign a 
register, and, if you've not been there before, you must create 
your character. 

After you identify your character by name and sex (yes, 
womert" are welcomed and possess a unique configuration of 
qualities) , you're given a set of characteristics that you may 
accept or reject; if you accept them, you still have the option 
to modify them, trading some for others. 

Then your character proceeds to the Main Hall where 
there's a weapons and armor store, a bank, a bar, an exami- 
nation room for evaluating your character's attributes in de- 
tail, an instructor for fighting skills, and a greedy old wizard 
waiting to fleece you when you buy his spells. Many of these 
things affect your character's make-up. AJl this is typical of a 
role-playing fantasy. 

When you enter the adventure, you communicate with the 
computer in two or three word phrases. Verbs, or com- 
mands, are no problem; you can call up a comprehensive list 
of those available at any time. You must come up with the ob- 
jects of the commands and determine when to say and do 
what. This is definitely the adventure genre. 

The flavor and settings of the scenarios vary greatly, and 
the inhabitants of each do too. In at least one scenario, you'll 
meet humans you may recognize ; don't assume they're friend- 
ly. And don't assume you're what you think you are either — 
characters may react to changes in you that you are 
unaware of. 

Settings range from mountain caves and dungeons to Ara- 
bian harems, from Bavarian castles to deserted Victorian 
mansions. The puzzles are clever and logical; you can safely 



map and finish an adventure without solving it, however. Well 
seasoned adventurers will find the series fairly easy going but 
still hard enough to be fun. The novice will find them difficult 
but solvable. 

In the end of each chapter, if you have been successful, you 
return to the Main Hall with gold and treasure with which you 
can buy new skills and learn new spells. This is also where you 
rearm and reoutfit, look in the mirror, and have a drink — per- 
haps eliciting a hint — at the local tavern. 

All subsequent adventures in the Swordthrust series re- 
quire your having created a character on the master disk; if 
you're wise, you'll take that character through The King's 
Testing Ground, the first adventure, contained on the master 
disk. Here you'll meet, and probably befriend, Richard, a 
great knight of old. Together, you traverse land and underwa- 
ter caves seeking treasures such as Excalibur, King Arthur's 
famous sword. Subsequent adventures depend only on this first 
one and are totally independent of each other. 

Second in the series is The Vampyre Caves, the name of 
which is the scenario's description. The Kidnapper's Cove 
comes next, followed by The Case of the Sultan's Pearl, a mys- 
tery, easy to get through but difficult to solve. 

In The Green Plague, you must work against the clock ; a 
look in a mirror at your green face tells you you've got the 
creeping crud. You must find the antidote before it's too late. 
The Eternal Curse may cause you great consternation until 
you grasp its message. A little familiarity with Oscar Wilde 
doesn't hurt. 

Literary references are not uncommon in the Swordthrust 
saga; they're fun and speed insight, but knowledge of their 
source or even recognition of them isn't necessary to play. 

Episode number 7, The Hall of Alchemic, is the first one not 
written by CE founder and owner Donald Brown ; its author is 
Peter Wityk. The difference is evident, but none of the saga's 
hallmarks have been besmirched. 

The Swordthrusts are not as grand or as emotionally in- 
volving as Wizardry can be ; they are not as complex and diffi-

cult, nor as comprehensive, as the Zorks. But they are unique 
and thoroughly enjoyable. If you like adventuring and fan- 
tasy, you shouldn't miss a single one. n(T 
Swordthrust, concept and adventures 1 through 6 by Donald Brown; 
adventure 7 by Peter Wityk; CE Software (801 73rd Street, Des 
Moines, lA 50312; 515-22i-1995) . Swordthrust 1 required for succeeding 
adventures. Each, $29.95. 

DataLink. This is a new Pascal telecommunications program 
designed to bring mainframe capabilities to the microcomput- 
er. It has the ability to modify itself for any system through the 
use of menu driven configuration routines. Once you deter- 
mine the word format and file protocol of any system that you 
wish to "talk" to, you can store this information in a file that 
can then be called by name and executed when needed. This 
means that once you adjust to a particular system you need 
never do it again. You may also place the routine log-on proce- 
dures in a macro file that can be executed at sign-on time so 
that you need not go through the "Hello, this is me, is that 
you?" nonsense each time you call. 

For those less adventurous souls who dislike being in- 
volved in such details, there are six preset configurations that 
wiU sign you on to the Source, CompuServe's MicroNet, and 
several other popular systems without your having to do any 
more than place your dialup system's phone number and your 
personal user I.D. into the file. You can define most of a ses- 
sion from diahng to hang up beforehand and then sit back and 
watch the whole affair proceed on its own. 

The program's most prominent feature is its dual compati- 
bility with the Hayes Micromodem and the Novation Apple- 
Cat. In the past it was near impossible to transmit files from a 
system using one of these modems to a system using the other. 
This feature alone makes DataLink a welcome addition to the 
Apple peripheral community. 

The program can carry on phone transmissions at up to 
1,200 baud and direct computer-to-computer transmissions at 
up to 4,800 baud. Another welcome feature is the ability to take 
over local control during a phone session, do some local proc- 
essing, and go back to the phone session without having to hang 
up and recall the other system again. This is very handy when, 
while in the middle of a phone session, you realize that you are 
missing a critical file that you want to transmit. You've only to 
push a key to drop out of the conversation, load the file you 
need, and then push another key to rejoin the call in progress. 

Accuracy is perhaps the most important consideration in 
data communications, and in this department DataLink con- 
tinues to illustrate the strength of its redundancy. Its main 
method of checking is the STX-ETX-LRCC mainframe proto- 
col, thought by many knowledgeable users to be the most de- 
pendable and efficient. Among the other protocols available to 
the system are the X-ON/X-OFF, ACK-NACK, and STX/ETX. 

Because DataLink is written in Pascal, it will automatical- 
ly recognize and configure itself to operate properly with any 
eighty-column board, terminal, or printer that is Pascal 
compatible. 

The documentation is complete and includes clear ex- 
planations of the system's many commands. Also included are 
an extensive trouble-shooting section that will lead you out of 
almost any error situation that you encounter, and a walk 
through a case study to show you how to utilize the system's 
many features. In addition to the manual there is a very thor- 
ough reference card that covers all of the commands and 
many of the varied modes of its operation. The only fault in the 
documentation is the choice of type style and the small size of 
the printing, both of which will be corrected in a future edition. 

Support for this product is excellent. A phone call brings a 
courteous and understandable answer to any question. The 
company also has an enlightened policy with regard to provid- 
ing updates to all registered owners. 

System requirements tor DataLink include 64K, Apple Pas- 
cal version 1.1, and either an internal modem or an interface 
card with external modem. The program is compatible 
with the Hayes Micromodem II, the Novation Apple-Cat II at 
300 or 1,200 baud, the Apple Comm Card with 300 baud external

Rearguard. By John Anderson. A bang-bang shoot-'em-up ar- 
cade game with some unique differences. You chase the 
aliens; they don't chase you. The screen scrolls horizontally; 
the terrain zips by beneath your ship. The aliens flee ahead of 
you across the screen. If ten escape, the game is over. 

You can stop the aliens in two ways : with your twin-mount- 
ed dart gun — you have an endless supply of darts — or with your 
ship. Careful, you can only renew your force field nine times. 
Full joystick control lets you ride their tail pipes for a seem- 
ingly sure shot. Watch out, the aliens come in pairs. At the last 
instant, they break for the top and the bottom of the screen, 
leaving you bamboozled in the middle. 

There are ten attack pairs in each wave of invaders and 
three waves in a fleet. The more you destroy, the more force 
shields you'll receive to help you face succeeding armadas. 

If you find yourself bored by the seemingly endless proces- 
sion of kamikaze aliens, a second playing level forces you to 
avoid the fireball debris of each shattered alien or be de- 
stroyed yourself. A third level cuts the size of your darts in 
half. On a fourth level, aliens who have successfully escaped 
off the right edge of the screen will shoot back! On the fifth 
level, all the aliens shoot back, even at the moment of their de- 
struction. All effects are cumulative from level to level so cau- 
tion in advance is advisable. 

All high scores are saved to disk after each play, with the 
result that the initials or nicknames of the top ten players will 
be saved for all time. Or you can wipe the slate clean and start 
over. PC 
Rearguard, by John Anderson, Adventure International (Box 3425,

The Turbocharger. By Roland Gustafsson. Tired of waiting for 
those 1-o-n-g program loads? Need to copy disks quickly? 
Would you like your files dated when you catalog? Want to per- 
sonalize your DOS commands? This could be the program 
for you. 

Disk access on the Apple is fast, but apparently there is 
room left for improvement; this program makes it even faster. 
For example, anyone who has ever saved an entire hi-res 
screen onto disk knows that it is a fair-to-middling sized file : 
thirty-four sectors on the disk. Loading it back onto the com- 
puter takes about ten seconds. With Turbocharger, it takes 
about half that. With a much shorter file you wouldn't really 
notice the difference. If you have long programs, lots of data, 
or if you make frequent trips to the disk, you will greatly ap- 
preciate the time savings. 

A display of the dates on which files were saved to disk can 
really make your catalogs look professional. Turbocharger is 
compatible with the Mountain Computer time clock, and with 
that accessory the date is automatically entered when you boot 
up the disk. Without the extra hardware, you can change the 
date manually. Because the current date is saved to disk, you 
only have to enter the date once, when you first boot the disk at 
the beginning of the day. 

Quick-copy, a separate program on the same disk, does ex- 
actly that: copies quickly. Very quickly. It copies an entire 
disk onto another initialized disk in under a minute. (Sorry, 
Blackbeard, protected disks won't copy.) Again, if you have a 
lot of material to back up, this program will save you a lot of 
time. 

Command Changer is for those of you who hate to type out 
catalog. It runs through the list of DOS commands and asks for 
your new command names. Hitting return defaults to the 
standard names. This may seem like a neat option at first, but 
after using it once you may not think so. Consider all those pro- 
grams you have that lise DOS commands. Your Hello program 
probably does a catalog. If you shortened catalog to cat every 
time catalog appears in a program, your computer says, 
"Who, me? I don't know any command named catalog." Con- 



clusion: it just isn't worth the trouble. 

Turbocharger' s documentation calls it "the utility that no 
Apple user should be without," a common claim in software 
advertising. If the speed of disk accessing and copying means 
a lot to you, get it. If not, there are probably other utilities you 
shouldn't be without. DD

The Keys of Acheron. By Paul Reiche III. Four Jewels, magi- 
cal keys of legend, each hidden in a different dimension, must 
be recovered from the domain of Kronus the Demon. The first 
jewel is guarded by the dragon who lives beneath the magi- 
cian's castle. To find the castle and conquer the dragon, you 
first must obtain the enchanted necklace of fire opals from the 
unicorn who lives within the mandrake grove. Every twist and 
turn in the grove seems to lead back upon itself. Press on, for 
the unicorn can guide you to the dragon's lair. 

The second jewel is hidden in a trackless jungle. The pri- 
meval swamp is filled with beasts from a far distant time — sa- 
bertooths, allosaurs, and the ferocious Tyrannosaurus rex. 
Through the jungle, across a river aswarm with beasts, lies the 
temple of the reptile men. Deep within the bowels of the tem- 
ple, you must face the Sserpa shaman. Take the amethyst key 
from him if you can. 

The third dimension, the crystal caves, is hidden in the 
heart of a dead volcano. Piranhas swim in its hidden pools. 
Earthquakes bring the volcano to life with paralyzing jets of 
steam, cave-ins, and crushing jaws of rock. 

In the shadowland of Kronus, you can wander endlessly. 
Constant clues and messages from Kronus seem to gxiide you 
on your way. Yet still you wander. For the eighteenth time, you 
return baffled to the central chamber. You have vanquished an 
endless procession of fiends, wraiths, shadow bats, and slime 
beasts. Once you encountered the deadly automaton (and 
lost) . You have given up again and again only to return, fasci- 
nated, the next day. 

This time you find the secret passage. You follow it down to 
the stormy sea. Black rain, waves, and whirlpools attack you 
on the crossing. You stand at last on the far shore. An image of 
Kronus forms and politely says, "Yonder is the onyx pathway 
which will lead you to my citadel. The path is old and in poor 
repair. The guard rail is broken in many places. Please be ex- 
tremely careful." . / 

You walk with care, but in an encounter with a wraith, you 
forget the instructions, and fall to your death. 

The Keys of Acheron is a sequel to Hellfire Warrior, Auto- 
mated Simulations 's sophisticated dungeon-and-dragon-type 
game. You must have Hellfire Warrior to play the Keys. You 
will use the Warrior's innkeeper program to keep track of your 
character, purchase armor and magic potions, and to give you 
new life after each defeat. Note: The monsters and magicians 
that inhabit the Keys are rather dangerous. The Keys should 
be explored only by experienced characters with sword and ar- 
mor that have been enchanted to at least the seventh level. 

The earlier Hellfire Warrior was created by Jon Freeman, 
author of the The Playboy Guide to Games. Freeman served 
as a play tester for the Keys, but the Keys' s dimensions are the 
product of a younger, more diabolical mind. There are more 
mazes and traps and false clues in Keys than in Hellfire, and a 
greater emphasis on puzzle solving. In the end it is your mind 
against the author's. PC

Zenith. By Nasir. Aptly titled, this home-arcade game from an 
established master may be the high point in a spectacular ca- 
reer—the culminating effort of a superior programming tal- 
ent. Everything we've come to expect from Nasir is present in 
Zenith. Yet it's still a step away from true greatness— from im- 
mortality in gaming. 

It didn't take the calculating mind of Sam Spade to predict 
that Nasir would make a better version of Horizon V. That 
game's scrolling 3-D graphics are truly amazing to look at, but 
the game itself lacks challenge and purpose. What was miss-

ing in the first game — feistier opposition and a worthwhile 
task to perform — are not problems with Zenith. 

The game gets its title from the uncompleted space city Ze- 
nith, which is being attacked by devil-may-care aliens. The 
game is playable with joystick or keyboard; you're advised to 
go with a joystick. Controlling the movement of your fighter 
via the keyboard is really tough. 

On the joystick, button zero fires your lasers and button one 
engages a device that has two functions — repairing buildings 
and capturing aliens. Points are earned for patching the flash- 
ing or burning portions of buildings damaged by the aliens, 
probably the toughest job in the game because of the speed 
with which the damaged portions fly by your sights. 

It's much easier to slaughter the aliens, which come in two 
basic forms. Most of the aliens appear as lazily rotating televi- 
sion aerials that are easily done away with. The other kind are 
not so innocuous. Little green men is what they are, but fiery 
balls of destruction is what they turn into. Get hit three times 
and your ship crashes spectacularly. 

Destroying all the aliens and rebuilding as much of the city 
as possible is the object of the game. You have a finite amount 
of fuel, but Nasir fans won't despair. There is the proverbial re- 
fueling episode precipitated by capturing three or more aliens, 
ones that haven't turned into fiery balls of destruction. Ex- 
changing the underdeveloped gumbles with the alien mother- 
ship garners more fuel or repairs for your ship. 

The trip through hyperspace rivals a similar excursion 
found in Horizon V, but in Zenith you're just a spectator. There 
are no elaborate docking skills required. The trick is captur- 
ing the aliens, which are never far from one of their fiery com- 
rades, and exchanging them before they die in captivity. 

Zenith's animation and graphics are superb. You can 
swoop and soar like Luke Skywalker in a rebel fighter over the 
Deathstar. The fiery alien balls seek out your ship more per- 
sistently than the antiaircraft fire in Nasir's Phantoms Five. 

The problem with Zenith is a lack of sophistication. The sce- 
nario is capable of keeping your interest through several 
games, and then it gets predictable. Labyrinth and Minotaur 
are two recent games that are impossible to predict, and the 
longer you play the harder they become. Eventually there is an 
end in those games too, but it takes a lot of time and accumu- 
lated skill to reach it. 

Zenith needs two or three more species of aliens and more 
than one docking sequence. It needs oceans and mountains and 
clouds. It needs wayward workers, caught by the aliens, who 
have to be rescued. The game is not disappointing like Horizon 
V, but it just hasn't gone far enough.

Firebug. By Silas Warner. In the midst of the latest wave of ar- 
cade games that stress high-speed action and contorted com- 
plexity of design, it is most refreshing to find a company dar- 
ing enough to produce a lo-res, just-for-fun game. Firebug is a 
nifty snake-style game ; the head of the snake is a detonator 
and the tail is the fuse. The object of the game is to bum down 
the five rooms on each level. Randomly placed gasoline cans 
aid in this pyromaniac's delight. As you pass over each of these 
cans, you can pick them up. Running around the room, you can 
then drop them off and prime them. As the fuse passes over 
them, they ignite, burning everything in the surrounding area, 
creating a sparkling display. When a wall or room divider is ig- 
nited, the fire spreads to engulf the entire wall. Other neigh- 
boring sections may be swept into the blaze. One well-placed 
detonation can sometimes produce an incredible Chain reac- 
tion. 

When you begin the game, you can determine the difficiilty 
factor by choosing the length of the snake's fuse tail. As time 
goes by, the tail gets shorter and shorter. If the fuse catches up 
to the detonator, it destroys you. Also, if you try to run through 
a conflagration, you will ignite. There are thirty levels with add- 
ed higher "challenge" levels for those skillful arsonists who 
make it that far. 



Children enjoy the game because, in its slower modes, they 
can follow what is happening on the screen and can control the 
game. For those who crave a faster pace, shortening the fuse 
length requires the same superhuman reflexes found in other 
arcade games. A most welcome summertime diversion. RRA

Apple Flasher. By Paul Mosher. Apple Flasher turns your Ap- 
ple II into a souped-up projector. It is simple to use, very quick, 
and powerful. Author Paul Mosher has spent a fair amount of 
time polishing this unpretentious utility, and the result is a pro- 
gram that shines. 

What Apple Flasher does is simple. It helps you look at hi- 
res screen images stored on disk. More important, Apple 
Flasher is simple. Once booted, you simply insert a disk con- 
taining some pictures, press a key, and a menu of all the thir- 
ty-three or thirty-four sector binary files on that disk is dis- 
played. These are almost always hi-res screen images. 

Beside each file name is displayed a letter from A to O, and 
pressing that letter will cause the picture to be loaded and dis- 
played. (The loading is much faster than a normal DOS bload.) 
At this point you can press another letter to see another pic- 
ture, or press escape to return to the menu. Pressing the space- 
bar while viewing a picture causes the bottom part of the pic- 
ture to be replaced by a display telling you what picture you 
are looking at and reminding you of your options. 

The menu page allows you to use several more powerful 
features. The scan mode lets you quickly review all the pic- 
tures on the disk. The slide projector mode imitates a circular 
slide projector, which can be controlled by either the arrow 
keys or a paddle and button. A possible added attraction would 
be the implementations of both paddle buttons in this mode, 
the extra one for moving backward. Apple Flasher also has an 
autodisplay mode in which pictures on one or two disks can be 
cycled through. Special time codes can be imbedded in the pic- 
tiires to control the rate at which the image changes. The auto- 
display mode is especially handy for advertising displays. 

Apple Flasher is loaded with nice touches. For example, it 
keeps the next and previous pictures in memory during slide 
projector mode, so, in most cases, access to the next slide is in- 
stantaneous. And, just about anywhere, you can load a fresh 
disk from either disk drive by pressing 1 or 2, without going 
back. 

Apple Flasher comes with a well-written manual that ex- 
plains each option clearly and in detail, and the program is 
well error trapped; it does not respond to bad key presses and 
is impervious to anything but a reset. 

Apple Flasher comes on a copy protected disk, and Crow 
Ridge will supply a backup for $7.50 plus postage. They will fix 
a damaged disk for the same price. RW

Scotland, NY 12127; 518-765-3620). $34.50. 

The Slide Show. By Bruce A. Cash and Robert W. Hench. This 
program (not to be confused with the software development 
package of the same name) was created for the ordering and 
display of up to seventy-five hi-res pictures in sequence, using 
a variety of special effects transitions. It takes input from Ap- 
pleplot, VersaWriter, The Complete Graphics System, and 
others, making it a nice organizational tool for educators, busi- 
ness people, and anyone who has hi-res graphics files scat- 
tered among several disks. Sequences — name of slide, posi- 
tion in sequence, and type of transition — can be printed out for 
reference. 

The keypress option for advancing the slides is a little awk- 
ward for group presentations, for which the game paddle but- 
ton option offers the best simulation of an actual slide projec- 
tor. A timed mode will leave each picture on screen for up to 
seventeen minutes. 

Error trapping is extensive and painstaking, with flashing 
arrows reminding you to check every menu selection. Thirty 
dashes on the cursor line make sure you won't go over the 
thirty-character maximum slide name. The creation of a slide 
sequence requires that the accompanjdng documentation be

followed closely the first time through; fortunately, the tutor- 
ial is as meticulous as the prompting, and the procedure is 
quickly learned. Two disk drives are recommended. 

The transitions themselves are handsome and effective, 
ranging from vertical and horizontal wipes to ripple effects, 
slow dissolves, and overlays; twenty in all. Text editing fea- 
tures come in very handy for modification of sequence, chang- 
ing slide names, backing over mistakes, and escaping back to 
the menu if you change your mind in mid-creation. 

The program's most viable applications are in business 
conferences, exhibits, and store displays. For the latter, the 
free-run transition mode option, providing automatic advance 
every nine seconds, is invaluable. A(

Swashbuckler. By Paul Stephenson. The blood chills and the 
hackles rise on the neck every time one of your characters is 
run through. It's not the graphics, although they're good — with 
the little man grasping his chest and dropping to the deck. It's 
the sound. The sound is very short and high-pitched. It resem- 
bles an indrawn breath saying "eek!" Its effect is that of fin- 
gernails across a blackboard, and there isn't any way you can 
turn it off, unless you take a pair of wire cutters to the speaker 
leads. 

The computer graphics and animation become ever more 
realistic and astonishing. In Swashbuckler, you are trying to 
eradicate the vicious crew of a pirate vessel along with their 
pet vermin. Your enemies include men with clubs, hatchets, 
swords, and spears. Their rats and scorpions crawl across the 
deck toward you: one bite from either reduces your reach 
from a lunge to a thrust. The fangs of a snake or the stinger of a 
scorpion will bring that fatal "eek!" 

Behind the battling figures on the screen are well-done sta- 
tionary graphics to help establish the mood. There are wooden 
beams, cobwebs, a great cannon, and others, depending upon 
the level. 

You stand in the middle of the screen, foil in the guard posi- 
tion, slightly raised. Three left-hand keys control your move- 
ment. Five keys on the right-hand side of the board control 
swordsmanship. You can parry high, parry low, thrust, lunge, 
or stay on guard. 

On come the baddies. You are always between your attack- 
ers. The higher the level you're on, the nearer the pirates and 
their helpers will appear. All's fair in love, war, and computer 
games. In other words, as you battle one enemy, the other will 
attack you from behind. 

You begin with three swordsmen and can earn another 
when you've done in twenty-five attackers. It's a gory game. 
When your sword goes through an enemy, he drops his weap- 
on and his jaw in surprise. Then he collapses to the deck in a 
heap. Finish off the second of each pair and more take their 
place. When your score is high enough, you move up another 
deck to meet even tougher adversaries. 

The animation isn't perfect. The scorpion, for example, is 
about the size of a large dog and moves jerkily. If you finish off 
a pirate while one of the vermin is moving toward you, it 
seems to return to its beginning position before it attacks. 

Then, too, it's difficult to understand what makes an effec- 
tive attack. The swords clash against each other, men grunt 
when they're stabbed, and there's the infernal "eek!" Place- 
ment and timing appear to be the keys, but they're the game's 
requirements, not necessarily lifelike. DA

nue, Chatsworth, CA 91311; 213-709-1202). $34.95. 

Deadline. By David Lebling and Marc Blank. A millionaire 
philanthropist has been found dead of an apparent drug over- 
dose in his library. You, the chief of detectives, have received a 
letter from the attorney of the deceased requesting that you be 
present at the reading of the will and have a look around while 
you're there. There is also the matter of the possible existence 
of a new will, made by the dear departed immediately prior to 
his depeirture, but subsequently, shall we say . . . misplaced. 
You are armed with an inspector's casebook, excerpts of 



suspect interrogations, the report of the medical examiner, 
and a packet of "tablets found near the body" (physical evi- 
dence). 

If the Mystery Writers of America gave an award for Best 
Fiction in Software, Deadline would win in a walk. Of course, it 
has little competition, but besides being a well-written pro- 
gram (with a vocabulary of more than six hundred words, 
full-sentence commands) , it is well voritten. This is an elegant 
mystery, with its roots in Agatha Christie rather than Mickey 
Spillane. Virtually all the suspects have you, the detective, out- 
classed by a mile in poise, class, and resourcefulness, and they 
love to let you know it in a number of subtle ways. You are 
bound to feel more like Lieutenant Columbo than Nick or Nora 
Charles as you muddle about these haunts of the very rich. 

The parameters of your investigation are the entire house 
and grounds, and the authors have loaded the whole estate in- 
to their program, down to the last garden hoe, toothbrush, and 
ancestral portrait. It's a real place, and every object in it is 
really there. It is a big program, though its speed (machine 
language) belies its bulk. Its sentence-comprehension ability 
can require painstaking prompts on the placement of the verb 
in relation to the subject, and results in an occasional non 
sequitur response, but once you get the hang of it, things can 
become rather chatty. If the program can't answer, it always 
tells you why, and it demonstrates a laconic wit in anticipating 
a lot of the sillier commands that may float into your head dur- 
ing the frustrating passages of the game. 

Those passages are many. It's easy to feel lost and helpless 
in Deadline. There is no treasure ; you have no weapons, no ad- 
versaries, and no quest — save for the truth and evidence to 
back it up. Your surroundings are of the familiar, mundane 
world and are largely inert; it's totally up to you to make sense 
of the world in which you find yourself. 

The disciplines required in Deadline are like those of no 
other adventure. You don't get to see a point score mount en- 
couragingly, and you can't even know if you're on the right 
track. You need to have a real grasp of deductive reasoning 
and a feel for minutiae. Linear thinking and direct action will 
get you zip. Your success is dependent on how strong a case 
you can make based on your accumulated evidence. 

The variables for subsequent plays of the game are some- 
what restricted — the facts of the murder, the method, and the 
culprit don't change — but even though it's always the same 
mystery, you are not likely to get a conviction your first time 
through, and you'll have to go back and reconstruct events 
again, searching for the evidence that will clinch your case. 
Therein lies the variety of Deadline. For anyone who ever 
loved a mystery — and who has a couple days free — it's indis- 
pensible. A(

Street, Cambridge, MA 02138; 617-492-1031). $49.95. 
Printer's Assistant. By Ed Magnin. This program is a joy. It 
rates near the top in almost every way, including having a val- 
id reason for existing. Very simply, it creates short (two-sec- 
tor) exec files that will set up formatted printouts and/or pro- 
gram listings on your printer or screen. Its best feature is the 
ability to set the left and right margins, other than the default 
settings of zero left and eighty right. This takes care of the ma- 
jor annoyances of the Epson involving the setting of margins 
and the lack of a linefeed in lines of more than eighty charac- 
ters, which causes overprinting. 

In use, the program requires no attention from the oper- 
ator. It places a short routine in memory that intercepts the 
PR# calls to your printer and adds the format that you have de- 
fined. PR# calls to peripherals other than the printer are not af- 
fected. If you want to go back to normal operation you just type 
exec PR#0 and everything will be as it was. That's all there is 
to know about it. 

The documentation is in the program itself and you may 
print a hard copy if you so desire. There is even a little exec file 
to see if the program with which you are using the Printer's As- 
sistant employs page 3 for any of its routines, the reason being 
that this little gem is tucked away in a corner of page 3 and

Star Blaster. By Mark Kriegsman and Geoffrey Engelstein. 
Your mission is to protect Earth from a barrage of attackers 
from the planet Dragon. As you patrol above a mountain 
range, the enemy's worst darts across the screen — and you 
must ward them off. 

There are eight levels of difficulty to live through, each one 
characterized by different attackers, the more difficult levels 
comprised of faster and more able enemies. Coming at you are 
fleeting spaceships, skeletonlike squares able to shoot darts, 
flying fish to devour you, and a moving wall which you must 
chisel through to escape. The final level is a challenge from the 
head of the Dragonian expedition, the Dragonian Annihilator. 
When you destroy it, the entire screen goes wild. 

Star Blaster offers a unique feature: two ways to see the 
game in action, either in the play mode or the demo mode. If 
you choose the demo mode, useful for practice, you can attack 
free from harm, although you score no points. One touch of the 
escape button brings you to the play /demo menu where you 
can choose to play for real. 

In the play mode, you score points whenever you destroy an 
attacker, but you are also vulnerable to their bullets. When you 
are destroyed, an explosion sounds. If all three of your ships 
are destroyed, the screen clears and you must start again at 
the beginning level. Hitting the escape key in the play mode 
will freeze the action. 

Star Blaster can be played with joystick or paddles. Sound

Apple-Link. By G. Jaffe and S. Pierce. This is not a commu- 
nication package in the sense of Data Capture or Z-Term, as it 
cannot communicate with systems such as the Source or Dow- 
Jones. What it will do is transfer any number of any type 
of DOS file to or from a Hayes Micromodem-equipped 
Apple. 

While a Micromodem is required on both the originating or 
base computer and the remote computer, only the base com- 
puter need have the Apple-Link program software. Actually, 
only the base computer need even be attended, given that the 
remote computer has been left turned on with the Micromo- 
dem in a ready state and the proper disk in its active drive. 

The program is menu driven and very easy to use. It also 
has sophisticated error trapping, so its operation is nearly fool- 
proof. By way of explanation, let's run through a typical 
session. 

First the remote system rfiust be booted and an initialized 
disk placed in the active disk drive to receive the files you will 
be sending. Next, the command in#(slot) places the remote 
modem in the auto-answer mode. That's it. The remote sys- 
tem is all set. Everything else will be controlled by the Apple- 
Link program in your Apple. 

On your end you boot the Apple-Link disk, a menu appears 
on your screen, and you select Auto Dialer and type in the 
number you want to call. The program now takes over and 
makes the connection and returns you to the menu. You now 
select File Transfer and your Apple formats the other comput- 
er's screen and transfers all the necessary software to its 
memory. 

Now the serious stuff starts. Your screen asks if you want to 
transmit or receive files. You type T and your system catalogs

the first twelve files on your disk, with a letter in front of each. 
You type the letter of each file you wish to send and the screen 
displays another batch and so on until you've seen the whole 
disk catalog. Now the screen tells you how many files you have 
chosen and prompts you for a start command. You oblige with 
an S and the program takes over. 

While a file is being transmitted, a clock appears on the 
screen that shows how much more time will be required to 
complete sending the current file ; a nice touch. 

You can abort the sending of a file at any time by hitting the 
escape key. Also, the screen tells you the sequence number of 
the file being sent so that you can tell how far along you are in 
your list of files. The end of the session can be made automatic 
so that you can start sending a long list of files and leave the 
room, knowing that the program will do the job and hang up 
the phone when it has finished. 

The error handling and error report functions, are like the 
rest of the program, well thought out ; each sector is verified by 
check-sum byte to ensure the integrity of the data. 

If you have frequent need to transfer files or programs to 
other users, this program is one you would want for your 
system. 

A backup is provided free when you return your registra- 
tion card. RIR

Escape from Rungistan. By Bob Blauschild. The recent 
advent of Sirius Software into the adventure game market with 
Kabul Spy is confirmed by Escape from Rungistan, a foray in- 
to innovation and experimentation. In Rungistan, the innova- 
tion is animation. 

Creature Venture from Highlands perhaps began true 
animation in adventureland with animated occurrences you 
could watch. In Rungistan, you must take part in or act during 
the animated scenes. In many cases, how you react is a life or 
death issue. 

You'll give a command that begins an animated sequence ; 
the command request reappears with a fast-blinking cursor 
while the animation continues. You must react by giving the 
appropriate command in the circumstance, hitting return be- 
fore the animated event ends. Quick thinking — and accurate 
typing — are necessities. 

For example, a mouse runs through your jail cell. You must 
catch the mouse, or at least stop it, before it gets away. As it 
runs across the floor, you must figure out that food might 
tempt it and offer it cheese. Sure enough, it takes the cheese in- 
to a comer; then you can catch the mouse easily — with the 
right words. 

The experiment works. Just as hi-res adventures replaced 
all but the best text adventures, so animated hi-res adventures 
promise to replace static ones. They are the next step toward 
the computer adventurer plajdng his role in a computerized 
video movie. 

The breakthrough doesn't replace the need for a good plot, 
good puzzles, and good graphics. For the most part, Rungis- 
tan has all three. 

The graphics are the colorful, comic book style popularized 
by On-Line and adopted by several others, including Sirius for 
Kabul Spy. Directions are easier to follow than in the latter 
game, although north is not always up or ahead on your 
screen. 

The plot is not deep or complicated; it will never compete 
for literary honors with the likes of Sentient's Cyborg. You 
must merely escape from jail and from the country; but 
enough side events occur along the way to make the story in- 
teresting. 

The puzzles are generally good. A few are mere traps, and 
the fact that the last one depends on finding the one of several 
synonyms that the game will accept to do the obvious is inex- 
cusable, but the majority are clever and satisfyingly per- 
verse. The help function is essential and very helpful. 

A great improvement over Kabul Spy is in the method of 
handling portions of the game in and out of memory. While Spy

required turning over the disk and waiting through a rather 
long load, then returning the disk to continue (and heaven help 
you if you accidentally moved back where you just came 
from — you'd have to go through the process twice again to 
recover), Rungistan simply loads in a new section when you 
enter it. Should you get yourself killed, you're given the option 
of starting over from the point immediately after any of the 
loading sections that you've already passed, with precisely 
what you had at that point.

Soft-Step. By Lee Stevens. This is an interactive debugg^g 
utility for Applesoft Basic programs with many features that 
can be used by even the novice programmer. They include the 
ability to step through a basic program one line at a time and 
pause and examine or define variables or memory. You can 
also place a break at any point of the program which causes it 
to stop and await your command. This is useful in trying to lo- 
cate a bug or to run only a portion of the program. 

The nicest features are the trace and list commands. Used 
together these improvements on their Applesoft counterparts 
allow you to trace all lines or a range of lines while listing each 
line just before its execution. This is especially useful because 
it does not require you to print a listing of the program in order 
to follow along with the trace. 

Other features include : print, which allows you to print the 
value of an expression; do, which predefines a command to be 
executed whenever the debugger pauses; and let, which al- 
lows you to change a variable's value. There is also an auto 
mode in which you can set a sequence of functions for the pro- 
gram to perform at a break without waiting for you to enter the 
instructions to do so. 

The program comes on a protected disk without a backup 
copy. There's no mention in the manual of how to obtain one, 



Tjaeen or ptjObos

though you can return a damaged disk with ten dollars and re- 
ceive a new copy. With this oversight corrected, this program 
could be given highest marks. 

The program is less than 3K in length, which is amazing 
when one considers the number of features included. Its small 
size allows a large amount of memory to remain free for the 
use of the program being worked on. The program resides in 
memory above the program being edited, at the high memory 
boundary. 

All in all, with its brief but good documentation, this pack- 
age is an excellent tool for any Applesoft programmer. RIR

Master Diagnostics and Master Diagnostics Plus. By Dr. 

Nicholas Romano. You may only use this program once or 
twice a month, if that often, but if it helps save you a trip to the 
shop, it will soon pay for itself. 

There are a number of options available in DOS 3.3. These 
include motherboard ROM test, Applesoft or Integer card test, 
parallel card test, RAM test, disk drive analysis, Mlcromo- 
dem II self-test. Monitor routines, and a help screen. For the 
disk drive alone, the program will test the read/write head, 
disk speed, the write/protect switch, and provide a head clean- 
ing routine. (There's a head, screen, and housing cleaning kit 
optional with the Plus program.) 

The manual is complete enough but demands very careful 
reading. It could use an indexed list of the problems that can 
occur. The section on internal maintenance describes how to 
clean the contacts on a card with a pencil eraser. DA

In lo-res graphics, the SCRN(X,Y) function returns the 
value of the color of the screen at the X,Y coordinate speci- 
fied. Unfortunately, no such equivalent function exists for use 
with hi-res graphics in Applesoft Basic. 

In the last few issues we've seen how to plot points in a va- 
riety of ways. Now, here is a routine for doing a hi-res equiva- 
lent of the SCRN(X,Y) function. One conceivable use for this 
routine might be in a game program in which knowing when 
one object is touching another is important. Using the SCRN 
routine given here, you can test to see if any points have al- 
ready been plotted at the coordinates a presumably moving ob- 
ject is about to use.

An Overview. You'll remember that last month we used the 
Applesoft hplot routines to plot a point. The X and Y coordi- 
nates for the point were passed to the routine via normal Ap- 
plesoft variables. 

The final plot was accomplished by setting a particular bit 
within a byte of memory. The bit to be set is determined by 
creating a "mask" for the bit position within the byte. 



Figure 1 (by now an old friend) was used as a guide to 
which bits are set for any given color and X coordinate. 

For our SCRN function we need to identify whether the bit 
corresponding to a given X,Y coordinate has been set, to take 
into account the high order bit (bit 7) where necessary, and 
then return a value between 0 and 7 corresponding to the color 
of the dot. Before going any further, take a look at figure 2, 
which shows the bit patterns for the color values that might be 
returned. 

What the SCRN routine does is establish a temporary regis- 
ter in which the bit pattern for the color value to be returned to 
the user will be constructed. Notice that for any of the possible 
color values we need only concern ourselves with the last three 
bit positions. This greatly simplifies our task. 

Note also that when a dot is "off" (either black), the rou- 
tine returns a number with bits 0 and 1 cleared. Bit 2 will still 
have to be specifically conditioned, however, since black2 sets 
the high order bit of a bj^e even though no dot is illuminated.

Figure 2. 

Because neither white is directly plotted, the routine will 
never return a value of 3 or 7. Remember that when white is 
specified, Applesoft normally plots only one color. Thus our 
SCRN routine has no way of determining whether a given dot 
is a pure color or part of a larger dot pattern creating a white 
line or area. 

To determine a dot's color from among the four remaining 
colors, we look at the X position of the dot. Since you can only 
plot even color values at even coordinates, and odd color 
values at odd coordinates, the two final bit positions of the col- 
or register value will be 01 or 10 depending on whether X is odd 
or even. The status of the third bit depends on whether the dot's 
high order bit is set or not. When all these checks are collected 
into a routine, we have the following procedure: 

1. Lines 28-38 retrieve the values of the X and Y coordi- 
nates from the Applesoft call command. These are transferred 
to the hi-res routine registers ($E0-E2) . 

2. The value for the X coordinate is returned in LINNUM 
($50,51) and, as such, can be checked for whether it is odd or 
even. To do this we need only check the low order byte to see 
whether the last bit (bit 0) is set or not. The easiest way to do 
this is to use the LSR (logical shift right) command on lines 
40,41 to shift the last bit into the carry flag, which will be tested 
almost immediately. 



A bit (pardon the pun) of programming style here. We 
could test for all six possible color conditions individually, but 
it turns out that it is easier to set up the final color value more 
subtly. Let's start by assuming that some color will be pres- 
ent. Line 42 puts a possible value (#$01) into LINNUM as a 
starting point. (Since we're done with LINNUM from lines 28- 
38 we can now use it as our working register for the color value. 
Also note that we no longer need to worry about LINNUM+1 
since the color value will never exceed 255.) 

Now we can do the carry test, BCS (branch on carry set) , to 
see whether the coordinate was odd or even. If the carry bit is 
set, X was odd, and LINNUM already contains the bit pattern 
for all colors that could be plotted at an odd coordinate. If the 
carry is clear, line 45 will be executed which shifts the pattern 
to the left one position to correspond to the "even" colors. 

3. Lines 48-51 do the JSR HPOSN which vdll calculate the 
address of the byte in memory that corresponds to the coordi- 
nates given. See the plot routines from previous issues if you 
need refreshing on this. Lines 53-55 load the byte into the accu- 
mulator and push it onto the stack to be retrieved later. 

The test on line 56 checks for whether the high order bit was 
set. A BPL (branch plus) is done if the bit was clear. If the bit 
was set, we need to set bit 2 of LINNUM (our color register). 
Note that bit 2 is clear for HCOLORS 0-3 and set for HCOLORS 
4-7. Bit 2 is set using the OR A (logical OR of accumulator) . If 
the high order bit was clear, the logical AND command is used 
to clear bit 2. 

4. Final check. Now we need to see whether the dot was ac- 
tually turned on or not. The memory hyte is retrieved from the 
stack using the PLA (pull accumulator) and masked with 
KBIT ($30) . MBIT is a mask created by the HPOSN routine to 
show which bit corresponds to the given X coordinate. By 
masking HBIT with the memory byte we can isolate the bit 
we're interested in. As a further step, the AND #$7F clears the 
high order bit (which we've already tested for anyway) . As an

Note the final result will only be nonzero if the dot is on. 

5. If the dot is on, everything is already set up, and we can 
proceed to the final exit phase. If the dot is off, the AND #$8C on 
line 71 will clear only bits 0 and 1. This allows us to determine 
the status of the high order bit, even if a dot is not actually plot- 
ted at the position given. 

6. SEND (lines 75-84) is identical to the REAL VARIABLE 
SEND routine given in an earlier issue and is used to send our 
resulting value back to Applesoft. The only thing different in 
this case is that the routine loads a zero into the accumulator 
instead of the high order byte of LINNUM (LINNUM+1) , since 
as mentioned earlier, the value for color will never exceed 255. 

Sample Program. To test this routine, bload the file at $300 
and call it using the sjmtax: 

CALL 768, X, Y, C 

where X and Y are the screen coordinates to examine, and C is 
the variable into which the routine will return the resulting col- 
or value from LINNUM. 

As an example of using the SCRN routine from Basic, this 
program will return all the possible values for C and illustrate 
the dependence of those values on hcolor and X position: 



0 HOME:VTAB 22:X = 0:Y = 0 
10 FOR 1 = 0 TO 7 
20 HGR:HCOLOR = I 
30 HPLOT X,Y 
40 CALL 768,X,Y,C 
50 PRINT"X = ";X,"COLOR = ";C 
60 NEXT I 

70 X = X -I- 1: IF X = 1 THEN 10 
80 TEXT:END 

The program goes through two passes, the first plotting all 
eight colors at X = 0, and the second with all eight colors at X = 
1. After doing the plot, the program calls the SCRN routine to 
verify that it reads the color we think we plotted. It will do so 
except in the following cases: 

1. White will always read as either 2,3,5, or 6. This is be- 
cause when white is specified, a single plot only illuminates 
one color dot. 

2. An attempt to plot an "odd" hcolor on an even X coordi- 
nate or an "even" color on an odd X coordinate returns 0 or 4 
as the result because of the plotting restrictions described in 
several of the previous articles. 

Conclusion. The SCRN routine can be applied in a variety of 
ways. In general, whenever you want to examine the screen to 
determine what color has been drawn, you can use this rou- 
tine. Possible applications might include graphics printing rou- 
tines and games in which it is necessary to determine the exis- 
tence of lines that represent walls or obstacles. 

If you wish to use the routine directly from machine lan- 
guage without calling it from Applesoft, simply delete the en- 
try routines and load LINNUM with the X coordinate and $E2 
with the Y coordinate.

tions for future ones, please don't hesitate to mail them in to 
the Softalk editorial offices. Your input is especially appre- 
ciated and can have an important effect on the direction this

. An Active Guy 
On SLi^ Easy Writer 



Bv iohathah miller 



It's been said that freelance writing is much like acting — 
many are called but few are chosen. While 25,000 people may 
call themselves freelance writers, fewer than three hundred, 
by one estimate, actually make a hving at it. And most of those 
are married to millionaires. 

Many so-called freelancers don't deserve to make a living 
slinging prose, anyway. They know not what they do. But 
others, a dedicated minority to be sure, undeservedly suffer 
the slings and arrows of an outrageous profession. They're 
humiliated by lunatic publishers, abused by sadistic editors, 
and hounded by merciless creditors in a contemporary ver- 
sion of a Gothic horror story. Their query letters are ignored, 
their ideas stolen, their prose butchered, and, to add injury to 
insult, they're led time and again to the postal altar to wait for 
checks that are never in the mail. What awaits instead are the 
creditors' final notices, a daily reminder that freelancers are 
not only out of step with decent, hard-working Americans, 
they're out of their minds. 

Down to Cases. Which brings us to John Boeschen, a free- 
lance writer and an Easy Writer user. 

The year is 1975 and this former Peace Corpsman is "get- 
ting it together." Seven years ago after he graduated from 
Stanford, Boeschen had no definitive goal or direction. But he 
decided to put away childish things — like a wild notion to bike 
around the world — in favor of marriage and a high school 
teaching career. True, $400 a month isn't much, but it's a be- 
ginning, the voices of conventional wisdom said. 

But John Boeschen rejected the conventional wisdom. After 
two years of teaching parochial high school kids the relativity 
of Einstein's theories, he decided to become a freelancer and 
parlay an emerging talent for writing simply about technical 
and scientific subjects into a career. He concluded that he'd 
rather spare the rod and write his own life's script. 

"Teaching was creative and exciting," Boeschen recalls, 
"but it also was frustrating and tiring. Besides, I discovered 



that I wasn't satisfied working for somebody else." Boeschen 
had already spent two summers writing science studies for the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture and, in the process, had 
tapped a hitherto unknown talent. He had been bitten by the 
bug. His association with the USDA led to his first freelance 
sale, to Flue Cured Tobacco Farmer no less, on a scandalous 
subject close to the hearts of growers everywhere : Sex and the 
Tobacco Bud Worm. 

Major life decisions take time, but Boeschen decided early 
that teaching was the wrong job for him. His eclectic nature re- 
quired greater stimulus, a curriculum as large as all outdoors. 
It was time to put up, shut up, and become a freelancer — a 
linear descendant of those freelance knights of old. The 
chances of succeeding weren't good, but what does it profit a 
man who takes no risks? Certainly, teaching high school kids 
was no risk-free bargain. Lots of hassles for lousy pay and a 
future promising more of the same. Whatever else freelancing 
was, it was at least a promising unknown. 

The Daring Young Man. As writers go, John Boeschen is a 
rather jolly, daring sort, which may say a lot about his suc- 
cess. Soon after graduating from Stanford, for example, he 
and a buddy pedalled across the United States on their ten- 
speeds, sleeping under bridges and in cow fields and foraging 
from roadside groceries. And when the Peace Corps sent him 
to Turkey to teach English without a working knowledge of the 
native language, Boeschen quickly improvised. He boned up 
on local idoms by passing himself off as a Bulgarian refugee, 
thereby discovering for himself the first law of foreign lan- 
guages: the only way to learn is to sink or swim. 

"And you always swim," says survivor Boeschen, our 
Turkish drop-in. "Even the most cantankerous American 
patriot will learn Turkish if" — forgive us — "he is dropped cold 
turkey into the system." 

This, of course, was precisely what Boeschen intended to do 
as a fledgling freelancer — jump in. He had an idea for a book

on hydroponics and proposed it to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 
the New York textbook publisher. The editors weren't taken 
with his idea, but they were taken with him. He was victorious 
in defeat: they invited him to become a textbook writer and 
rewriter for them, a relationship that has lasted seven years. 

Branching Out. It was an auspicious beginning, but the 
novice freelancer soon learned that one client doesn't make a 
career. BYeelancing is a business, not a hobby, and survival re- 
quires diversity. One must have creative fingers in a number 
of market pies, from books to trade publications to consumer 
magazines to business newsletters. 

In Boeschen's case, that meant manipulating his typewrit- 
er for Family Circle, Beverage World, Potato Grower, and 
countless trade publications. In those early years, he'd often 
chum out over a dozen stories a month for $100 here and $200 
there. The writing was easy, but the work load impossible; 
Boeschen decided it was time to make his next great leap for- 
ward and buy an Apple. 

The trouble is, when you've been earning $400 a month, 
have an old car — Boeschen still tools around in a red, 1971 
Maverick — and do something as crazy as freelance writing, 
banks look askance at lending you $5,000 for a computer and 
printer. Writers are strange enough, says Boeschen, but writ- 
ers who play with computers — Boeschen's voice drops to a 
mock conspiratorial wWsper — are even stranger. This was 
1978, remember — ancient history in the computer era. 
Benighted people of that time still thought Apples only gn:ew on 
trees. 

So when his friendly banker behaved predictably and said 
no, Boeschen fell back and punted. He joined a much more co- 
operative co-op up in his suburban bailiwick of El Sobrante — 
that's across the bay from San Francisco — to get his loan and 
launch an enterprise that's doing very nicely today, thank you. 
He's doing nicely because he's got his Apple, his two Easy 
Writer word processing programs (the baby and the profes- 
sional), and the makings of a diversified business that in- 
cludes cottage publishing. He's writing books like Freelancing 
for Fun and Profit and The Build the Bed Book (St. Martin's 
Press) and virtually producing them right there in his little 
northern California den. 

"There's a whole new era opening up for writers," 
Boeschen says with wide-eyed wonder. "It's a great life, it 
really is. It used to take me many, many revisions to put a 
story together, but now with the Apple and the Easy Writer, 
here it is the first time. It's original and clean and it reads well. 
It's been a revolution in my life." 

Through the Looking Glass. If all this sounds vaguely like a 
religious conversion, well, perhaps it is. When Boeschen 
speaks of revolution, he's not just talking about the joys of 
painless editing. He's saying that the bloody machine has 
seduced him with its synergy and profoundly affected the way 
he writes. 

"You know what it is?" he asks, brightening with a sudden 
insight. "You know what that screen is? It's Alice's mirror. It's 
the looking glass she fell through. It is, it really is. It pulls you 
in, because the whole process is so dynamic. It's like 3-D. 

"Before, writing on a typewriter was kind of two-dimen- 
sional and flat, but here you have all these acrobatics on the 
screen, the way the letters cartwheel across, do tumbles and 
flips or disappear if you want them to, or reappear somewhere 
else. It's like going to a fair or carnival. I can sit in here all day 
and love it. My wife says, 'How can you do it?' I say, 'It's easy, 
fun, exciting.' I'm just getting feedback from the machine all 
the time." 

Writers are not generally too keen on machines. Comput- 
ers in particular are viewed by some members of the profes- 
sion like agents of a foreign power. 

Back in the late seventies when Boeschen was stepping out 
into a brave new literary world, word processing wasn't even a 
dirty word. There was precious little software for an Apple 
writer to buy, let alone abuse — but fioeschen has never re- 
gretted his choice. He went with one of the earliest word proc- 
essing programs— Easy Writer, the brainchild of John 




Free Enterprise: 
A business 
management game 

It offers the high energy, high risk pace of a 
corporate president . . . without the stress! 

It's your opportunity to sit on top and run a corporation. 
Free Enterprise, based on an IBM-developed simulation 
for training top-level managers, is as surprising and 
demanding as the real world. 

It lets you face the same on-your-toes challenges you 
would in running a real business: pricing products, 
determining budgets for advertising, production, plant 
improvement, and R&D. Even securing bank loans 
and deciding on stockholder dividends. You use 
computer-generated reports to make decisions. But 
if you're wrong you could go bankrupt. Only the 
shrewd survive! 

Free Enterprise can be played at three competency levels 
so novices can compete with the more experienced, and 
from one to six can play. It's the perfect chance to learn 
about the free enterprise system — to practice business 
strategies — and to enjoy it — with no risks. 

To obtain Free Enterprise, see your local dealer.

Draper, the legendary Cap'n Crunch. "It's never botched up a 
file, never lost anything, never crashed a disk," says 
Boeschen. "It's extremely fast, extremely simple to use, just a 
beautiful little program." 

Just His Type. What makes Easy Writer particularly at- 
tractive to Boeschen is the program's incremental spacing fea- 
ture in the print mode. It gives his completed work a profes- 
sional appearance by adjusting spaces as much as l/120th of 
an inch between characters. 

"When you're dealing with editors and professional groups, 
you're working on image," he says. "Incremental spacing 
gives you that justified professional look and I'm sure it played 
a part in my getting the contract to do a newsletter. My print- 
ing costs were much, much less than those of the larger firms 
bidding on the project." 

Boeschen usually knocks out his stories on Easy Writer and 
runs them on a Qume printer. When he's working on more 
complicated projects like his two books, he formats pages on 
his companion Easy Writer Professional program. It displays 
in eighty-columns and goes incremental one better, marrying 
his professional program to an IBM Electronic 50 (via an Es- 
con converter) to get proportional, type-house-quality spac- 
ing. "I think this is going to be the wave of the future as far as 
New York publishers are concerned," says cottage publisher 
Boeschen. "They're sort of in a budget crunch— to pay me to 
do a whole book including production saves them money be- 
cause I can get them mechanicals (layouts) and do it quick- 
ly. With the Easy Writer Professional, once you've figured out 
the picas or inches, you can wrap text around a picture right 
there on the screen. And it fits." 

The budding book writer still has to come up with ideas that 
sell, says Boeschen, but marginal proposals may make it over 
the rejection hump if camera-ready packagfing can be offered 
as part of the deal. 

Under such arrangements, authors end up doing a lot

more work, but they also gain potentially greater control over 
the final design by supplanting the middlemen— typesetters 
and paste-up artists. When printing, the cottage publisher still 
retains control because the Professional allows him to stop the 
printer at any point on any line . ' 'I use this system every day," 
says Boeschen. "It has paid itself back a hundred times, what 
with the mail merge (with Easy Mailer) for the editors' 
names, the query letters, the typesetting, and the original writ- 
ing. I don't think you can get a better system than these two 
combined." 

The Bouncing Ball. The words are those of a satisfied cus- 
tomer, but what's most important to Boeschen is the process, 
not the product. Word processing has had a deep influence on 
both his writing and his perceptions. Writing has suddenly ac- 
quired a new dynamic — a visual right-brain stimulus that trig- 
gers a chain of free associations. At the flick of a switch, words 
and paragraphs dance to the writer's tune. 

When Boeschen says that word processing has made "a 100 
percent difference in his writing," he's not just talking about 
instantaneous editing. Word processing has also changed the

way he composes. All those acrobatic characters cartwheel- 
ing across the screen have liberated the visually oriented right- 
side of his brain. And that, in turn, has inspired a new ap- 
proach to composition, a process he calls "mind mapping." 

Boeschen mind maps by drawing a verbal sketch of, say, 
an interview he's writing up. In the middle of a large sheet of 
paper he writes down the main theme of his article and circles 
it. Then, without consulting his notes, he tries to go with the 
free associative flow. In the spaces around the circled theme, he 
jots down words and phrases that simply pop into his head as 
he eyes his scratch canvas. 

"I never write whole sentences," says Boeschen, "just 
words and short phrases. They're like prompts on the Apple 
computer." Within a few minutes he has mapped out the en- 
tire article arid is ready to stitch his crazy quilt of random 
ideas into free-flowing prose. 

"Now that I have a word processor, writing has a lot more 
texture, a lot more ripples and bulges and soft and touchy 
things," says Boeschen. "You see something that catches your 
eye and gets you going a whole new, different way. It's sort of 
like Star Trek's transporter. One moment you're hung up on 
some block of type in front of you and the next, you hit a con- 
trol key and you're off that little starship paragraph and on a 
whole new world." 

Sometimes one of these flashes occurs when Boeschen is 
scrolling something out of sight and out of mind. Sometimes 
one occurs after he has let his concentration and his eye 
wander from the monitor. He'll be gazing out the window of his 
den, concentrating on a tree or a plane passing overhead, when 
suddenly there'll be a picture of what he's writing about. 

"It's not words, it's a picture," he says, almost awestruck. 
"It's in your head, of course, but I think the screen is facilitat- 
ing that. That's the mind blower for me. It's not just the gram- 
mar and being able to make corrections and revisions quickly. 
It's putting you more in control with what you really feel. I 
think what you write on a computer is more personal. It is a 
machine, but it traps your personality." 

Into the Vortex. It was probably inevitable that word proc- 
essing and hours of speculation on its meaning would lure 
Boeschen into programming. Boeschen says he's not techni- 
cally oriented, but he is a tinkerer, a cerebral tinkerer whose 
machine is a prose poem with now-moving parts called words 
and graphs. He's dropped through his looking glass, just as he 
once dropped into Turkey, though the language he has had to 
learn is computertalk — and very Basic. "Basic is a weaver's 
language and I'm a weaver," says Boeschen. ' 'I like to go back 
and forth and bring things together. 

"Here's this computer and here I am tinkering. It tells you 
when you make a mistake and gives you a lead on how to cor- 
rect it and you find out there's a whole new way in which an- 
swers to the question exist, that there are different approach- 
es to solving problems." 

Not only that, but there are different approaches to making 
a buck. If you can master English and Turkish (Boeschen got 
the master's degree from Berkeley in the latter) , why not com- 
puterese? 

We're Off To See the Mlzard. Freelancing with a computer, 
after all, is serendipitous. It leads you into cottage publishing 
and then down countless branching yellow brick roads. It has 
led Boeschen to craft two programs — a freelancer ledger that 
keeps tabs on his multifarious business activities, and a health- 
hazard appraisal which he administers for local hospitals and 
community groups. Boeschen's wife Sandy, a hospital plan- 
ner, encouraged him to develop the latter with a little bit of as- 
sembly-language help from programming friends. 

"Talk about captivating an audience," says Boeschen, who 
travels to hospitals with his Apple II Plus and a Silentype print- 
er. "You get them with the blipping lights and then you get 
them with the silent printing and they're ready to buy, but it's 
free." 

Well, not exactly free. Boeschen charges his client groups 
for the service, but he says they're happy to pay because the

It offers intellectual stimulation arcade games can't 
match . . . with all the excitement. 

Fast-action fun isn't just for mystery or arcade games any 
more. Cross Clues is a word game that tests more than 
mere reflexes. It's the mind-challenging evolution of the 
crossword puzzle, with beat-the-clock excitement. The 
playing tempo is lively, but you decide how fast you want 
to go. The computer "umpires" while you compete with 
another player for hidden words, coaxing clues from the 
computer. Since a clue helps your opponent too, suspense 
builds till the end, when the best combination of skill, 
intellect, timing and luck wins. 

If you're ready for an even greater challenge, try 
Concentration Crosswords™ a game that offers 3 levels 
of difficulty and 3 ways to play — for even the most 
demanding word whiz. Again, you compete against the 
clock to uncover hidden words. But once discovered, they 
disappear, to test your memory. Here, a combination of 
word skills, intellect, memory and luck determine the 
winner. 

Both games offer 50 mind-boggling puzzles that appeal

program builds a positive image for the organization while 
providing general health data on respondents. 

Boeschen has yet to alter his business card to read, a la 
Paladin, "Have program, will travel," but he's obviously 
thinking along those lines. He's started to write software 
manuals for different groups and he is eager to delve into ma- 
chine language, if ever he can steal the time. 

But there's the rub. Sometimes it gets pretty hard to keep 
all these eclectic balls in the air. It's not easy writing books, 
stories, manuals, grant proposals, computer programs, news- 
letters, and brochures— and then playing at-home daddy. 

Reveille. Boeschen's day begins dark and early — at 5:00 
a.m., to be exact. He usually gets in two hours of writing before 
the family rises. Boeschen turns off his Apple so that his two 
kids. Coulter James, six, and Trent John, two, can watch tele- 
vision cartoons without signal interference. He makes break- 
fast if his wife's in a hurry, prepares and packs the kids' 
lunches, and is back at his console by 8:30. He usually calls it 
quits for the day at 3 : 30 when his older boy returns from school 
and Boeschen must drive the housekeeper to the bus stop. 

When he first started freelancing, Boeschen used to put in 
longer days, but, as he says, "your whole life changes when 
you've got kids. The kids can see you more, but they also see 
you more grumpy." Then, with a touch of anguish in his voice, he 
adds, "There are times, sometimes at 3:30, when I know I 
could finish something if only I had an hour — and I can't do it." 

Freudian Rejection Slips. Writing is often an agonizing 
process, even with a word processor, even for a pro. For a free- 
lancer, though, the actual writing is often the least of his prob- 
lems. Before a freelancer can suffer the sweet agonies of crea- 
tion, he has to sell publishers and magazine editors on his 
ideas. That usually means dealing with a large order of rejec- 
tion, which often takes its toll in what is commonly described 
as burn-out. 

That's where Boeschen found himself about a year ago. "I 



was just finding it hard to sit down and do the work," he re- 
calls. "Rejection is part of the game, but I found myself mut- 
tering curses and I knew I needed a vacation. I needed to stop 
working and change my attitude, because I was starting to 
worry about money, which really wasn't the problem and indi- 
cated to me that there was something deeper." 

What Boeschen did, in effect, was take a busman's holiday. 
He spent three months delving into programming and studies 
linking creativity and visual stimulation of the right brain. 
These explorations, in turn, helped ease a middle-class psyche 
that was having difficulty dealing with the unpredictability of 
freelance income. 

"Our lives are regulated around middle and end of the 
month clocks," Boeschen says. "That's one of the reasons I de- 
veloped that ledger program, so I'd know precisely where I 
stood. It's funny, but in spite of wanting to break away from 
that attitude all these years, I have never been able to. I'll still 
get despondent. I'll be down for weeks. There's no money com- 
ing in, it's all going out. Then, three or four months later, a big 
check will come in and I'm elated." 

Safe and Sound. Boeschen still has his momentary bouts 
with doubt, but he's back on an even keel. He knows that to suc- 
ceed at freelancing you have to treat it as a business ; to keep 
from going bats you also have to approach it as a game. You 
psych out your different markets, then hit the appropriate 
verbal buzzers and bells to keep those editors and publishers 
salivating. And if, as inevitably happens, some blockhead re- 
jects your brilliant idea, you shrug it off and move on. 

"The way I look at it, there are 64,000 to 70,000 magazines in 
the United States and Canada," he says. "I don't depend on 
any one thing for income. No one magazine can keep me from 
paying my bills. What else can they do to me? They can't slur 
my name, because no one knows me. 

"And that's kind of a neat position to be in — an unknown." 

That is, until now. HI

Tools of the Craft, Part 14 

If you took the time to tackle and sub- 
due last month's closing exercise, you 
should now have a reasonably interest- 
ing command processor running on your 
Apple. For the benefit of those of you who 
are just now catching up after having de- 
toured to take advantage of the lovely 
summer weather, you were asked to 
write a FXJNCTnON, NewCommand, that 
accepts a single-character command 
from the console keyboard, but echoes a 
complete command name. For exam- 
ple, 'A' would be echoed as 'Add,' 'S' as 
'Subtract,' and so on. Blanks were to be 
echoed as typed, but otherwise ignored. 
Illegal command characters were to be 
rejected, with an appropriate error mes- 
sage. NewCommand was to return a 
function value of type ComType. 

Here, embedded within a program to 
test it, is one version of NewCommand 
that meets the requirements outlined; 
how does it stack up against your own? 

PROGRAM 
TestCom; 

(♦Test driver program for FUNCTION 

NewCommand *) 
TYPE 

ComType= (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Quit); 
FUNCTION

:Char; 

(* Return Ch, converted to upper case 

(capital) if Ch is lower case. *) 
BEGIN (* Capital *) 
Capital := Ch; (* No change unless lower case *) 
IF ((Ch >= V) AND (Ch <= V)) 
THEN (* It's a lower-case letter — transform it! *) 
Capitol := Chr(Ord(Ch) - Ordfa') -I- Ord('A')); 
(* Otherwise, it's not a lower-case letter, so leave it 
alone. *) 
END (* Capital *); 
FUNCTION 
NewCommand 
:ComType; 

DESCRIPTION: Prompts for, and accepts user input 
characters until one corresponds to a ComType 
command, then returns the matching value. A, S, M, 
D, and Q mop onto Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, 
and Quit. Treats capitals and lower case as 
identical. Echoes blank for blank, command name 
for command characters, and ILLEGAL 
COMMAND' for all other characters. Pressing the 
return key is equivalent to pressing space bar. *)

Note that this version of NewCom- 
mand uses our old friend Capital so as to 
be able to treat upper and lower case 
characters identically. Also, notice that 
all input characters are read from the 
Keyboard file, not from Input. This dis- 
penses with the otherwise automatic 
echo that the operating system supplies 
for every character typed and permits 
NewCommand to provide its own cus- 
tomized feedback to the user. 

Armed with what you've already 
learned about Pascal's input and output 
facilities, you are nearly qualified to 
solve the majority of problems that in- 
volve I/O. All you need now is a little 
practice, and you'll certainly get prac- 
tice if you follow this column ! This is not 
to say that we've exhausted the topic; 
there's still a "wild I/O frontier" to ex- 
plore at the far edges of the Pascal sys- 
tem, where programmers live or die by 
their own rules. On the other hand, 
there's no compelling reason to proceed 
down that winding trail when there are 
still a few milestones left along the main 
road. Let's head back in that direction, 
reexamining certain I/O concepts more 
closely before moving on to other topics. 

By Any Other Name. We've been us- 
ing physical file names for some time 
now without knowing exactly what they 
are, how they are formed, or why they 
are needed in Apple Pascal. A brief dis- 
cussion here should fill in the gaps and 
will prepare us to investigate the subtler 
nuances of Apple Pascal's file-naming 
conventions whenever necessary as we 
travel down the Path. 

As you've seen already, a physical file 
name is a string of characters that may 
contain letters, digits, punctuation sym- 
bols, or a combination of all three. You 
may want to think of physical file names, 
such as 'PRINTER:' or 'MY- 
PROG.CODE' or 'MYDISK:MY- 
FILE.TEXT' as addresses, since they en- 
able the operating system to find the files 
they name as surely as the address '11021 
Magnolia Boulevard, North Hollywood 
CA' enables you to locate the offices of 
Softalk. 

The exact syntax of physical file 
names in Apple Pascal reflects the way 
I/O is organized in the system, so an 
overview of that scheme should give us 
some useful insights. At the lowest level 
of the operating system lie the device 
drivers, which we introduced (but did not 
examine) in earlier discussions. Written 
in the Apple's 6502 microprocessor ma- 
chine code, the drivers actually control 
and communicate with the hardware I/O 
devices that are connected to your 
Apple. 

It is the job of the machine code 
drivers and the P-code operating sys- 



tem, working together, to make each de- 
vice appear to your programs as one or 
more volumes. (Usually, a single vol- 
ume corresponds to a single hardware 
device, but sometimes, especially in the 
case of high-capacity hard-disk units, the 
drivers will be written in a way that 
makes the device appear to be several 
different volumes. This scheme provides, 
among other benefits, better means for 
organizing programs and data, as you'll 
see after you've gained a reasonable 
amount of practical experience with the 
system.) 

When Volumes Vary. Certain vol- 
umes — for example, those correspond- 
ing to the system console and printer — 
may reasonably be treated as individual 
files by your programs. That is, these vol- 
umes are naturally the sources or desti- 
nations for individual (and indivisible) 
sequences of input or output data. Such 
volumes are said to be unblocked. Other 
volumes, such as those corresponding to 
disks and tapes, may be treated as stor- 
age, on which many different files may 
coexist. Volumes that may be subdi- 
vided into files are said to be blocked. In 
general, if a volume may function as a 
single file, it is probably unblocked; if it 
can hold more than one file, it is definite- 
ly blocked. 

If you want to associate a given file 
variable with an entire volume — if, for in- 
stance, you want to send some output 
data to the printer — you need to open the 
file using a physical file name that desig- 
nates only the volume that interests you. 

Every volume in the system is identi- 
fied by a specific, unique volume num- 
ber. Appendix D of the Apple Pascal Op- 
erating System Reference Manual con- 
tains a table entitled "Pascal I/O Device 
Volumes" which gives the volume num- 
bers of the twelve standard Apple Pas- 
cal input /output devices. In the table, the 
volumes described as "disk drives" are 
blocked, while those not so described are 
unblocked. For instance, volume #6: cor- 
responds to the standard printer (an un- 
blocked volume), volume #1: to the con- 
sole (also unblocked), and volume #4: to 
the bootstrap (first) disk drive (a blocked 
volume) . 

The Real Thing. The character 
strings '#6:', '#1:', and '#4:' are legiti- 
mate volume names. These character 
strings may be used as complete file 
names if you wish to access the asso- 
ciated volumes as single files. This is ap- 
propriate for the unblocked volumes 
named by '#6: ', and '#1 : ', but not usually 
for the blocked volume represented by 
'#4:'. Furthermore, although entire 
blocked volumes may be treated as sin- 
gle files, they may only be safely ac- 
cessed as such using facilities of Apple 
Pascal that we won't cover until we re- 
visit the topic of I/O later on down the 
Path. For purposes of discussion, then, 
we'll assume that the names of un- 
blocked volumes are also legitimate 



physical file names, while the names of 
blocked volumes are not. 

Unblocked volumes have permanent 
symbolic volume names which are syn- 
onymous with their numeric ones. For 
example, taken as a volume name, the 
character string 'CONSOLE:' is equiva- 
lent to '#1:', while the string 'PRINT- 
ER:' names the same volume as '#6:'. 
The table in the Apple Pascal manual 
lists both the number and the symbolic 
name for every volume. 

When you refer to a volume "by num- 
ber," you tell Pascal that you want to 
deal with the specific, corresponding 
physical device. For an unblocked vol- 
ume, such as the CONSOLE: or the 
PRINTER: , the Pascal system draws no 
distinction between the volume number 
and the corresponding symbolic name, so 
you're free to use whichever you wish. 

In contrast, the typical blocked vol- 
ume (a floppy disk drive, for example) 
does not have a permanent symbolic 
name, even though it may always be re- 
ferred to by number. Instead, it bears the 
name of the "removable volume" (such 
as a floppy disk) that it happens to con- 
tain at any given moment. To illustrate, 
suppose you used your system on Mon- 
day, putting the Applel : disk in the first 
disk drive and the Apple 2: disk in the 
second one. Then, volume #4: would as- 
sume the name 'APPLEl:', while 
volimie #5: would acquire 'APPLE2:'. In 
other words, '#4:' would be equivalent to 
'APPLEl : • and '#5 : ' to 'APPLE2 : '. Now, 
suppose that on Friday you mounted AP- 
PLET: in the first drive, as before, but, 
for a change of pace, mounted APPLE3: 
in the second one. In this case, '#4 : ' would 
remain the same as 'APPLEl:', but '#5:' 
would now be equivalent to 'APPLE3:'! 

See the Light. All of this implies that 
the only way to be sure of accessing a 
particular physical disk drive is to use its 
volume number. When a Pascal pro- 
gram opens a file, specifying '#4:' as a 
volume name, you will always see the 
first disk drive's light flash briefly, indi- 
cating that Pascal is seeking the file us- 
ing that drive. When the program speci- 
fies '#5: ', it will always be the light on the 
second disk drive that flashes, and so on. 

Of course, we've already agreed that 
when opening a file on a blocked volume, 
the volume name alone is insufficient as 
a physical file name. We must add to the 
volume name something that enables the 
Pascal system to distinguish between one 
file and another on the same blocked vol- 
ume. It turns out that each file on a 
blocked volume possesses its own local 
file name, and that is what we must add 
to the volume name in order to complete 
the physical file name. For instance, the 
file SYSTEM. PASCAL exists on the AP- 
PLEl: disk; its complete physical file 
name is ' APPLEl :SYSTEM.PASCAL'. 

Note that a local file name is unique 
for any given volume, but may not be 
unique across volumes. In other words.

two different volumes with different vol- 
ume names and numbers may contain 
files bearing identical local names. AP- 
PLEO: and APPLEl: both contain files 
named SYSTEM.PASCAL, for example. 
On the other hand, no single disk may 
contain two different SYSTEM.PASCAL 
files. Since physical file names must al- 
ways specify a volume, the Pascal sys- 
tem can always tell the difference be- 
tween a file and its namesakes on other 
volumes. 

"Hold it!" you say. "We haven't been 
specifying volumes in any of our physi- 
cal file names before this month!" Well, 
that's true to an extent. You certainly 
haven't been using physical file names 
such as 'APPLEl :LISTER1. TEXT' or 
'APPLE2:GUESS.C0DE' in your pro- 
grams or in your dealings with the Edi- 
tor, Compiler, or Operating System. 
Names like 'LISTERl.TEXT' (or prob- 
ably just 'LISTERl') and 'GUESS' have 
always been sufficient. This is because, 
in order to resolve possible ambigfuities, 
the system itself adds a volume name to 
your physical file names if you neglect to 
do so. It adds the name of the system pre- 
fix volume. 

It's Automatic. Whenever you boot 
Apple Pascal, the system assumes that 
the prefix volume is the one that is 
mounted in the booted disk drive. Since 
for most people, this volume will be AP- 
PLEl:, Pascal translates a name like 
'LISTERl.TEXT' into 'APPLEl: LIST- 
ERl.TEXT'. Remember also that cer- 
tain utility programs add special suf- 
fixes to the file names you supply. The 
Editor appends '.TEXT', and the exe- 
cute command appends '.CODE', for in- 
stance. Thus, if you decided to write 
some edited text into "MYFILE", the 



Editor would first translate that name 
into 'MYFILE.TEXT'. The operating 
system would then complete the physi- 
cal file name by producing 'AP- 
PLEl : MYFILE.TEXT'. Be warned. 



however, that the operating system ap- 
plies no suffix to any file names that your 
programs give to Reset or Re Write; at 
this level, the system is only responsible 
for appending the prefix volume name, if 
necessary. 

So you see, your Apple Pascal system 
has been using complete physical file 
names since the first time you turned it 
on, even though you may not have been 
conscious of the fact until now. The rail- 
road syntax diagrams for a physical file 
name are given as figure 1. Note that a 
volume name may not contain more than 
seven characters, a local file name may 
not have more than fifteen (including suf- 
fix, if any), and a colon is, obviously, ex- 
actly one character. The sum of all these 
parts implies that a physical file name 
will never (and must never) exceed 
twenty-three characters in length. 

The syntax diagrams also imply that 
LOCALNAME', '*LOCALNAME', and 
LOCALNAME' are all valid physical 
file names. It turns out that, due to a 
quirk in the operating system, ': LOCAL- 
NAME' is considered to be the same as 
'LOCALNAME'. '*: LOCALNAME' and 
'♦LOCALNAME' are also synonymous 
(but only with each other!). The curious 
asterisk in this second set of file names is 
just a shorthand way of signifying the 
name of the bootstrap volume. Note that 
the bootstrap volume name (also known

as the "system volume name") is not ne- 
cessarily the same as the prefix volume 
name. They start out the same when- 
ever Apple Pascal is booted and will re- 
main so unless and until the prefix is 
forcibly changed, either by a human be- 
ing using the Filer utility (which we'll 
study soon) or by a program employing 
certain advanced and esoteric methods 
(which we won't study for some time). 

Name or Number? When supplying a 
physical file name to the Pascal system, 
should you refer to a volume by its num- 
ber or by its symbolic name? Let's look 
at your options by way of analogy. Disk 
drives are similar to houses, each with a 
particular "street address," while flop- 
py disks, having symbolic names, are 
like the people (or, more properly, the 
families) who live in those houses. 

If Eileen lives at 1 Crawford Street, 
there are two ways to send a message to 
her. You can tell the neighborhood mail- 
man to deliver a note to "Eileen," or you 
can address the note to "Occupant, 1 
Crawford Street." So long as Eileen lives 
there, she'll get your note, no matter 
which way you address it (though she 
might be insulted to get a note for "Occu- 
pant"). If you have reason to believe Ei- 
leen may have moved, however, the 
safer choice is to address the note to "Ei- 
leen." This way, if she has indeed moved, 
the mailman will be able to forward the 
message to her new address. On the 
other hand, if you address the note to 
"Occupant," the mailman is duty-bound 
to deliver the note to the specified street 
address, and Eileen will never read what 
you have to say (but someone else — the 
new occupant — might!). 

Suppose that you have a file named 
HELLO. TEXT on the disk EILEEN: in 
the second disk drive. Either of the fol- 
lowing calls to Reset will associate that 
physical file with the text file variable 
TFile (which we assume to have been de- 
clared prior to the Reset call) : 

Reset(TFile, '#5:HELLO.TEXT'); 
Reset(TFile, "EILEEN:HELLO.TEXT'); 

In the first case, including the volume 
number '#5 : ' in the file name causes the 
Pascal system to look for HELLO.TEXT 
on any disk that happens to be in the sec- 
ond disk drive at the time of the call to 
Reset. This is much like addressing a let- 
ter to "Occupant" and is a technique to 
use when your program cannot be sure 
(or doesn't care) which disk is in a given 
drive. So long as a file HELLO.TEXT ex- 
ists on that disk. Reset will associate it 
with TFile. The disk's volume name— 
whether it be EILEEN:, APPLE2:, 
GARBAGE:, or any other— is irrele- 
vant. This can lead to problems. Per- 
haps, for example, two different disks, 
EILEEN: and HERRING :, both contain 
files named HELLO.TEXT, but only the 
file on EILEEN: contains data that is 
suitable for a particular program. If that 



program used the former example of Re- 
set to open TFile and HERRING:, not EI- 
LEEN:, was seated in the second disk 
drive, the program would acquire non- 
sense data through TFile. In general, the 
program has no way of knowing that 
TFile has been associated with the wrong 
HELLO.TEXT. 

Anywhere Is Home. To solve this 
problem, the symbolic volume name 'EI- 
LEEN:' is used in the second example 
call to Reset, thus ensuring that the file 
opened will be on the EILEEN: disk. The 
use of a symbolic volume name instead 
of a volume number implies that the 
specified disk may reside in any disk 
drive. For instance, you might put EI- 
LEEN: in the second disk drive one day, 
and another day, you might place EI- 
LEEN: in the third or fourth drive. This 
makes no difference to the program us- 
ing HELLO.TEXT since, whenever it 
opens a file, the system automatically 
scans the disk drives to find the EI- 
LEEN: disk. The second example call to 
Reset will fail only if EILEEN: is not 
mounted in any disk drive, or if EI- 
LEEN:, although mounted, does not con- 
tain a file named HELLO.TEXT. 

The preceding scenario does not ac- 
tually tell you how to choose between the 
two methods of specifying volume 
names, nor was it intended to. The choice 
between numeric or symbolic volume 
names is not always easy or obvious, and 
the criteria for the choice changes with 
each new program. The ability to choose 
wisely is another of those skills that is 
probably best learned through expe- 
rience — by designing, building, and ob- 
serving programs. It does seem that the 
use of symbolic volume names leads to 
more flexible and "friendly" program 
behavior (although this is not always the 
case, as we'll see in coming months). 
You may be interested to learn that both 
the bootstrap volume name and the pre- 
fix volume name are remembered by the 
operating system in symbolic form when- 
ever possible. 

Into the Heart of Read and BeadLn. 
Earlier in our travels down the Path, we 
drew a sharp distinction between ASCII 
characters that look like digits and the 
numbers those characters resemble. For 
example, the character '2' is not the 
same as the Integer number 2. The char- 
acter '7' is not the same as the number 7. 
You can add the numbers 2 and 7 to get 
the number 9, but there is no operation 
(at least not in Pascal) that permits the 
"addition" of the characters '2' and '7' to 
get the character '9.' 

As an analogy, let's use groups of 
rocks to stand for numbers and painted 
tiles to stand for the digits in the Char 
data type. The number 2 would be repre- 
sented by two rocks, the number 7 by sev- 
en rocks. The character '2' would be rep- 
resented by a tile with a '2' painted on it, 
while '7' would be painted on the tile that 
stands for the character '7.' 



Harkening back to first grade math, if 
you put two rocks and seven rocks to- 
gether, you get nine rocks, the proper 
representation for the number 9. If you 
put the '2' and '7' tiles together, however, 
you don't get nine tiles, and you don't get 
a tile with '9' painted on it, either. (What 
do you get? That's a question for another 
column.) Evidently, conventional arith- 
metic applies to rocks and Integers, but 
not to painted tiles or elements of the 
Char type. 

Pascal can acquire only Char values 
from your keyboard. Suppose one of your 
programs calls Read to get two Integer 
numbers from the console, and you sup- 
ply 123 and 456 at the keyboard. Al- 
though what you type may look like num- 
bers to you, Pascal actually receives two 
three-character sequences: '1', '2', and 
'3', followed by '4', '5', and '6'. It is the job 
of Read and ReadLn to "look" at these 
character sequences and decide which 
numbers they represent. This is known 
as a data conversion, from Char to 
Integer. 

Here is a function, Integerlnput, 
that accomplishes this conversion. In 
performance and architecture, Integer- 
Input is very similar to the code Pascal 
itself uses to do the same job.

The type of the input parameter In- 
File is given as Interactive becaiise, as 
we've discussed, logic designed to deal 
with Interactive files vdll also work vdth 
regular Text files. On the other hand, 
logic designed for Text files does not al- 
ways apply to Interactive devices, since 
it often assumes the "initial Get." If you 
use Integerlnput in one of your own pro- 
grams, be sure that any actual parame- 
ters corresponding to the formal param- 
eter InFlle are of type Interactive, not 
Text. (Of course, if you forget, the com- 
piler will always be there to remind you.) 

About Real Number Input. The con- 
version procedures for Integers are per- 
manent parts of the Apple Pascal Op- 
erating System and occupy RAM mem- 
ory (though not much of it) at all times. 
The conversion of Real numbers from 
character representation to internal for- 
mat, while similar in approach to that for 
Integers, is much more complicated, as 
you can imagine after comparing the 
syntax diagrams for Integer and Real lit- 
erals. As a result, the amount of P-code 
that is necessary in order to convert be- 
tween Real numbers and their character 
representations is too large for this code 
to be included as a permanent part of the 
Apple Pascal Operating System. In- 
stead, it is stored in a file named SYS- 
TEM.LIBRARY on your bootstrap disk. 

When you execute a program that ac- 
cepts input or produces output of Real 
numbers using Read, ReadLn, Write, or 
WriteLn, the Pascal system looks for 
SYSTEM.LIBRARY. If it finds that file,

the system extracts the Real-number 
conversion code from it and loads it into 
memory with your program automati- 
cally. The bootstrap disk should be 
mounted at this time so that the sys- 
tem's search for SYSTEM. LIBRARY 
will succeed. If the search fails, you will 
receive an error message. Once your pro- 
gram begins to execute, you may re- 
move the disk containing SYSTEM.LI- 
BRARY (unless your program needs 
that file or disk for some other purpose) ; 
the conversion code will remain in mem- 
ory until your program quits executing. 

A Quiz and a Bug. Here is a tiny pro- 
gram. Cover up the paragraphs that fol- 
low it; then try to determine exactly 
what it does and how it works by study- 
ing the listing only. 

PROGRAM 

Mystery; 
(* What does it do? *) 
BEGIN (* Mystery *) 
REPEAT 
Read(Keyboard, OutputA); 
IF EOLn(Keyboard) 
THEN 

WriteLn 
ELSE 

Write(Output, Keyboard A); 
UNTIL EOF(Keyboard); 
END (* Mystery *). 



The Mystery program does nothing 



Mystery2; 
(* What does it do? *) 
BEGIN (* Mystery2 *) 
REPEAT 
Read(OutputA); 
IF EOLn 
THEN 

WriteLn 
ELSE 

Write(KeyboardA); 
UNTIL EOF; 
END {* Mystery2 *). 

Now, recompile and see what the 
compiler thinks of your new program. 
You should receive a couple of identical 
error messages for yoiu- trouble ("Error 
20 — '.' expected"). 

What Happened? Before you pull out 
your hair trying to decide where you mis- 
understood the Pascal language, you 
should know that the compiler is faulty; 
it simply contains a bug. For various rea- 
sons, it fools itself into thinking that In- 
put < and Output < stand not for Char 
variables, but for something else. What 
that "something else" is cannot be ex- 
plained right now, but may become ap- 
parent to you once you understand the 
concepts of record and pointer, which 
we'll cover soon. 

Finally, Mystery, like any program 
that gets its input from the Keyboard file, 
demonstrates a certain characteristic of 
that file: Pressing the return key sets 
EOLn (Keyboard) True, but pressing 
control-C does not affect EOF (Key-

more than echo keyboard input to the 
screen. We've seen echo programs be- 
fore, so what makes this one so special? 
Well, it manages to use Read and Write 
(not Get and Put) without declaring any 
auxiliary storage variables (such as 
"Ch," which seems almost obligatory in 
programs of this sort) . This program is 
an example of "tricky coding" — that is, it 
exploits subtle features of the language in 
an attempt to achieve a certain result us- 
ing minimal storage space or execution 
time. In this case, we exploit the fact that 
Input A and OutputA, being windows to 
Interactive files and hence to FILEs OF 
Char, are thus full-fledged Char vari- 
ables in their own right and can be the ob- 
jects of Read and Write calls. By using 
this technique, we save the space that 
would be occupied by a single Char vari- 
able — hardly any saving at all. 

Of course. Mystery's particular trick- 
iness is unnecessary and baffling to any- 
one who knows how to use Get and Put 



and should not be used in writing real 
programs. As a rule of thumb, you should 
endeavor to write clear, understandable 
programs, even at the expense of execu- 
tion speed or memory storage (unless the 
waste is simply too severe). All this 
aside, you can still learn a great deal by 
contorting the language as we've done 
here. For example, in every spot within 
Mystery where the identifier "Key- 
board" is used, substitute "Input," and 
then recompile. How does the new ver- 
sion of Mystery behave? 

Next, recall that Read(Ch) is the 
same as Read (Input, Ch). So, shouldn't 
Read(Input, OutputA) be the same as 
Read (OutputA) ? Of course ! But does the 
compiler agree with you? Try collapsing 
the Read, Write, EOF, and EOLn calls to 
their "default" forms (where the source 
or destination file is merely implied) , and 
then change the program's name so that 
Mystery finally looks like this:

board) at all. In other words, control-C is 
not the end-of-file designator for the Key- 
board file. What is? Try control-shift-®. 
That is, press the control, shift, and at- 
signs keys simultaneously. This gen- 
erates the ASCII "NUL" character, 
which corresponds to the Integer 0. It is 
this character that sets EOF (Key- 
board) . 

Why should Keyboard and Input, 
which both correspond to the console key- 
board, use different end-of-file designa- 
tors? The answer lies deep inside the p- 
System, and is properly the subject of an- 
other column. You might try an experi- 
ment, however. Modify Mystery to ac- 
cept its input from the Input file instead 
of from Keyboard, and then compile and 
execute it. Verify that this version of 
Mystery recognizes control-C aa denot- 
ing end-of-file. Now, try control-shift-®. 
What happens? 

A Correction. Sharp-eyed readers 
may already have noticed that the dia- 
grams for "Reset Call" and "ReWrite 
Call," in figure 2 of the June 1982 "Pas- 
cal Path," were slightly incorrect. (As 
picky as the compiler is about proper 
syntax, calling a railroad diagram 
"slightly incorrect" is just as absurd as 
saying someone is "moderately dead" or 
"a little bit pregnant.") The diagrams 
should have indicated that, within the Re- 
set or Rewrite parameter list, a comma 
must separate the "(file variable) iden- 
tifier" from the "character string." The 
corrected diagrams appear as figure 2. 

Stay Tuned for More Exciting Ac- 
tion I Proponents of Pascal are fond of 
saying that it is "a superior language for 
expressing complex data structures." 
Translated to English, this simply means 
that Pascal permits you to group related 
data together in very convenient ways, so 
as to simplify your programming chores. 
Next month, we'll look at techniques for 
doing this by employing three handy 
groupings: arrays, records and charac- 
ter strings. You can't be considered a 
Pascal expert until you understand "data 
structuring," so don't miss out on next 
month's discussion. In the meantime, 
test your expertise with data conversion 
and file I/O by writing a procedure that 
conforms to the following definition: 

PROCEDURE 
lntegerOutput(VAR 

OutFile 

interactive; 
Souce 
ilnteger); 

(* Send to OutFile the character representation of the 
Integer, Source. Put out only as many characters as 
are necessary to represent the Integer (no leading or 
trailing blanks, etc.). *) 

Thirty days should be more than enough 
time to finish; in fact, your challenge is to 
do it in two hours or less (one hour to 
think about the problem, and the other to 
write the procedure) ! Good Luck!

Would 




If you're currently 
using Apple Pascal* on your 
Apple II, you're probably aware 
of some noticeable limitations. 
And you'd probably give a lot for 
an upgrade package, including 
the UCSD p-Systemf UCSD Pascal 
and TURTLEGRAPHICS, that would get 
your Apple* to do what it's capable of. 

Upgrade to the UCSD p- System 
Version IV from SofTech Microsystems. 
It's got all the features of Apple Pascal, 
and then some. For instance, Apple Pascal's 
UNITS must be linked in at each compilation, 
the p- System's do not. And instead of being lim- 
ited to 32 UNITS, like Apple Pascal, the p- System 
allows a virtually unlimited number. 

How about peripheral support? The p- System 
supports all the peripherals that 
Apple Pascal does, plus a clock, 
and a lower case adapter. And, 
we get more out of the periph- 
erals you've already got— 
shiftware modification on the 
keyboard, alpha lock key, 
typeahead and characters 
not even on the Apple 
keyboard. 

And when it 
comes to graphics, our 
TURTLEGRAPHICS 
has everything in Apple's 
graphics, plus automatic 
scaling and four graphic modes, 
including both HIRES and LORES 

Then there's portability The 
p- System lets you develop gen- 
uinely portable, high-level applications for nearly 
any microcomputer around. It allows you to work in 
any combination of UCSD Pascal and BASIC 




(available as an add-on). 
And it provides support for 
dynamic memory man- 
agement and multitask- 
, with a full arsenal 
oT enhancements. And if 
that isn't enough, your 
existing Apple Pascal 
' programs are upward 
compatible with the 
p- System, and simply 
have to be recompiled 
to execute. All your Apple 
II needs is 64K of RAM 
and two disk drives. 

Last but not least, there's 
the price. Normally, you'd have 
to pay as much as $825 for such 
a package. 

But, for the next two months, 
we're making this special upgrade 
offer to Apple Pascal users for a 
mere $295. That's a savings of 
over 60%. 

So just send in the coupon 
below, with your proof of pur- 
'- chase and check, money order 
or Visa or MasterCard num- 
ber, and you'll be on your way 
to getting more out of your 
Apple II than you ever dreamed 
of. But you'd better hurry 
Your two months have already 
started.

□ Leading Edge Products (Canton, 
MA) , a microcomputer products distrib- 
utor, has formed Leading Edge Prod- 
ucts and Research Division. Says chair- 
man Michael B. Shane, "There is a need 
for a distributor such as LEP to con- 
tribute to the development, evolution, 
and improvement of the product we mar- 
ket. It's our desire to work with our man- 
ufacturers ... to provide them with max- 
imum technical support and input for 
product improvement." 

The new division, located in Bedford, 
Massachusetts, will be headed by Phil 
Florence, executive vice president. Flor- 
ence was previously manager of new 
product development at Wang. 

LEP has also strengthened the war- 
ranty coverage of its C. Itoh printer line, 
reduced turnabout time for repairs, and 
streamlined administrative procedures 
among the company, its dealers, and au- 
thorized repair centers. 

John Fisher, newly appointed man- 
ager of technical services, was previous- 
ly with Honeywell for ten years in a va- 
riety of management positions in field 
engineering. 

□ Enthusiastic response during field 
testing of computer-based analjdical and 
polymer chemistry courses has prompt- 
ed the American Chemical Society 
(Washington, D.C.) to establish a com- 
puter courses program in its education 
division. Apple II course programs in 
organic and polymer chemistry are now 
available for delivery; business con- 
cepts and statistics courses will be re- 
leased soon. Courses in analytical tech- 
niques, physical chemistry, biochem- 
istry, and chemical engineering are in 
development. 

"Computer courses require no pro- 
gramming skills but demand frequent 
user response, collection of data during 
experiment simulations, or use of user 
selected data or information," says Ken- 
neth M. Chapman, head of educational 
research and development. "These 
courses allow users to proceed at their 
own pace and select entry and exit points 
at will." 

Details on course purchase and rental 
are available from ACS Computer 
Courses, American Chemical Society, 
1155 Sixteenth Street, N.W., Washington, 
D.C. 20036. 

□ George V. Grune, vice president and 
director of the Reader's Digest Associ- 
ation, has assumed the position of chief 
executive officer of Source Telecomput- 
ing. He will retain his membership on the 
Reader's Digest board of directors and 
remain director of the books and record- 
ed music division. Bettie Alexander 
Steiger has been named vice president 
and special assistant to the chief execu- 
tive officer for corporate relations. She 
will represent Source Telecomputing to 
the videotex industry. Says George 
Grune, "Bettie Steiger's experience as 
head of our information resource area 
makes her the ideal choice for this im- 



portant and sensitive new role."

SOFICfiRD 
Symposium 

by Greg TIbbetts 



iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii 



In this month's column we'll deal once again with the DDT 
utility and cover some of the DDT commands we missed last 
month. Before we begin, however, a brief recap is in order. 

DDT is a software tool that is supplied by Digital Research 
or its agent with nearly every copy of CP/M sold. Probably one 
of the most widely used programs in the CP/M world, its ini- 
tials stand for dynamic debugging tool. 

DDT's function is to aid program debugging by allowing 
control of memory and program execution at a very primitive 
level. Note that when we talk about programs in relation to 
DDT, we are generally referring to assembly language pro- 
grams rather than to programs in Basic, Fortran, or some 
other high-level language. While DDT can be used to load, 
change, and otherwise manipulate both the "program files" 
and data files associated with such languages, it is not pri- 
marily designed for these purposes. Assembly language and 
machine code, however, are DDT's natural environment; when 
used in this manner DDT is extremely valuable. 

Last month we covered the six commands that control the 
memory manipulation features of DDT. These are: 

S — Set/examine memory locations 

D — Display a range of memory locations 

L — List a disassembly of machine code in a range of memory 

F — Fill a range of memory with a specified value 

M — Move a block of memory to a new location 

A — Assemble in memory mnemonics and addresses specified 

Inner Control. These commands allow you to exercise con- 
trol over the memory contents of the transient program area 
(TPA) without involving anything outside the system (that is, 
peripheral devices such as disk drives) , and without Involving 
program execution. 

Essentially, in one form or another, all of these commands 
involve either reading and display or input and storage of data 
into memory addresses. The L and A commands are the most 
sophisticated, since they involve the use and conversion of 8080 
assembly language mnemonics from and to their numeric 
counterparts. Even if this were all DDT could do, it would be a 
valuable utility. There are, however, six additional functions 
that involve dynamic interaction with the system. These func- 
tions increase DDT's usefulness tenfold. DDT's further useful- 
ness is our focus this month. 

During the discussion that follows, we'll use the program 
DUMP.COM (the one we have spent the last several columns 
working with) as an example. You'll recall that in our May ex- 
amination of ED.COM, we used ED to alter the source file for 
the DUMP program somewhat, and then in June, when we ex- 
amined ASM.COM, we explained those changes and their re- 
lationship to the workings of ASM. The modifications we made 
to DUMP had the functional effect of separating the dumped 
data into 128-byte chunks to make it easier to read. They also 
added a colon after the address to further improve readabili- 
ty, and checked automatically for the presence of an eighty- 



column device or the lack of one, formatting the line output ac- 
cordingly. This month we'll use DUMP as a basis for exam- 
ining the various file and program control functions of DDT. 

To do this we're going to make another change to the 
DUMP program. What we'll do here applies both to DUMP as 
it comes from Microsoft and also to the modified version that 
resulted from our previous work. 

The changes we'll make will have two effects: first, this 
new version of the program will ask you at the start whether 
you want hard copy output or screen display and will perform 
appropriately based upon your answer; secondly, if you request 
a hard copy printout, this program will disable the forty-col- 
umn feature in the modified version of the DUMP program. 

Mod Squad. To accomplish our modification to DDT, three 
routines are needed: one that will print the question on the 
screen and get a reply ; one that will check the reply and ma- 
nipulate the LST and CON vectors to send output to the appro- 
priate device, and one that will determine whether the combi- 
nation of forty-column normal output and hard copy is in ef- 
fect and, if so, defeat the forty-column portions of the modified 
DUMP program. There is also a fourth routine to be installed. 
This routine disables all the alterations we will make when the 
program exits. 

Normally, these routines would be added to the actual 
source of the program you were working with (as we did when 
we made the other modifications using ED) and then the 
source would be reassembled with ASM. This, however, in ad- 
dition to not demonstrating DDT, assumes that you have the 
source for the original program. In many instances, you don't, 
and yet you still need to modify the program. We will now 
learn how to go about it using only DDT. No pretty printouts 
will be generated, nor will there be an easily understandable 
source file, but what we're going to do will work and, after all, 
isn't that what really counts? 

First let's describe the routines and see what needs to be 
done. Although they are trivial in themselves, interfaces to 
existing programs can often be tricky and such work should 
not be approached haphazardly. Allow proper time for study 
and planning when attempting this sort of thing. We have 
space limitations, so we may shortcut some of the description 
relating to the planning and study phase ; don't assume that be- 
cause we've left it out, it is not really important. 

Printing a message on the screen, our first alteration, is 
probably among the simplest of things to do in assembly lan- 
guage in CP/M, and yet even for all that simphcity, there's 
something really satisfying about seeing the visual effect of 
your efforts as your message appears on the screen. The sim- 
plicity results from the fact that there is a routine in the BDOS 
module that automatically prints a string to the console when 
BDOS is called with certain parameters in certain registers. 

As we've discussed in the past, BDOS performs a number 
of these functions, called system calls; everything from print- 
ing characters on the screen to opening files. System calls are 
initiated by loading the [C] register with the appropriate func-

tion number and. depending upon the call, loading certain 
other registers with the parameters, and finally, by entering 
BDOS itself. Since BDOS may be in different places in differ- 
ent systems, there is a jump vector (a JMP instruction and the 
address of the beginning of BDOS) stored at location 0005 in 
every CP/M system. Using this jump vector, we can simply 
call location 0005 and go directly to BDOS, returning to our 
code at the completion of the subroutine. 

By the Book. These system calls are listed in volume one of 
the SoftCard manual in the section beginning on page 3-43. 
Brief descriptions of each of the calls are contained there also 
and will tell you all you need to know to use them. Looking in 
this section we learn that the print string function is system 
call number 9. We also learn that the print string function re- 
quires that register C contain a 9 and that the register pair 
[DE] contain the address of the beginning of the string. We see, 
too, that the string is stored in memory as ordinary ASCII 
character values and that the routine will print values until it 
encounters a "$" character. 

Our first task, then, is to define an area somewhere at the 
end of the DUMP program to hold our question string. Next, 
we must write code that loads [C] with 9, loads [DE] with the ad- 
dress of the beginning of this area, and then calls memory lo- 
cation 0005 (the indirect vector to BDOS) . 

The purpose of the next part of our first routine is to get an 
answer to our question. This involves getting an input charac- 
ter from the keyboard, which we see from the list is function 
number 1. All we need to do is to load [C] with 1 and call 5. When 
control returns to our program, the character received will be 
in register [A]. Assuming that our question is "Output to P- 
printer or S-screen?", our routine in assembler will look like 
this: 



JMP PRSTR 

MSG: DB 'OUTPUT TO P-PRINTER OR S-SCREEN? $" 

PRSTR: LXI D,MSG 

MVI C,09 

CALL 5 

MVI C,01 

CALL 5 



And the hex values for our question string will be as follows : 

4F, 55, 54, 50, 55, 54, 20, 54, 4F, 
20, 50, 2D, 50, 52, 49, 4E, 54, 
45, 52, 20, 4F, 52, 20, 53, 2D, 53, 
43, 52, 45, 45, 4E, 3F, 20, 24 

The next routine we need is one that checks our answer and 
manipulates the output vectors appropriately. We can do this 
with a simple compare for the value of the letter P and per- 
form the operation if we have a match, or skip it if we don't. 
Before doing the compare, however, we'll want to output a pair 
of carriage return/line feed combinations. 

Since our original message did not have a CRLF sequence 
appended to it, the cursor will still be left following an echo of 
the character we entered in answer to our question. The pur- 
pose of the extra CRLF is to separate the output to follow. We 
could output the characters one at a time, but it is just as easy 
to make one string of four ASCII values — 0D,0A,0D,0A, and a 

— and then print the string given earlier. We'll need to save 
the newly received input character during this last print string 
sequence so we can still make our compare. We can do this by 
pushing the contents of the processor status word, PSW, and 
the accumulator [A], on the stack. This is done with a PUSH 
PSW instruction. 

Two- Way Street. Our routine to alter the output vectors fol- 
lows now. As you have learned from previous colvunns, or from 
the lOCB section of the SoftCard manual, all output and input 



for character data is handled through a system of vectors. Li 
this way it is possible to substitute a new output (or input) rou- 
tine for the existing one by placing it anjrwhere in memory and 
simply changing the vector. 

We know that the console output vector (by which charac- 
ters are printed to the screen) is located, low byte then high 
byte, at location F386 and F387, while the list output vector 
(which directs characters to the system printer) is at F392 and 
F393. If we place the contents of the list output vector into the 
console output vector, all further output will be directed to the 
system printer. Since we won't be using the list output vector 
during this period, we can use it to save the current contents of 
the console output vector. At the end of the prog^ram we'll want 
to change them back. 

So far, then, our second routine looks like this if written in 
assembler:

0F392H

Although the routine is getting a little longer, it's still quite 
manageable so far. We are still not through, however, since we 
still need to prevent forty-column output from going to the print- 
er, and we need a way to make sure that we switch the vectors 
back only if we switched them in the first place. We will do the 
latter through the use of a special program flag that is initial- 
ized to zero but changed to OFFH by the routine that switches 
the vectors. When we've finished printing the file, we can sim- 
ply check the flag to see if we need to switch the vectors around 
again. 

The task of disabling forty-column output could be accom- 
plished in a number of ways, but probably the most general 
one is simply to alter the byte in the slot types table that our 
new version of DUMP.COM checks to see if an eighty-column 
device exists. This is a more general way than changing the 
DUMP program itself, for example, because it doesn't depend 
on DUMP having every instruction in the same place ; that is, 
it will work on both modified and vinmodified copies of 
DUMP.COM. 

In any case, by forcing DUMP.COM to believe that there's 
an eighty-column card in slot 3, we can ensure 80-column out- 
put. We should change the byte back at the end, however, in 
case some other program or routine checks for it. CP/M itself 
will not, but programs such as DDT do check this byte on ini- 
tialization to determine their own output width. 

Our second routine, then, now looks like this:

Return to Sender. Now all we need is the routine to switch 
everything back when we're done and we'll be ready to install 
all of the routines we've created. This last routine will be a 
rather simple one because we are going to cheat a little. When 
we finish printing the file, we'll check for the value of FLAG. If 
it is non-zero, we'll replace the value that gets loaded into [A] 
(two instructions above SKPIT) with the value from FLAG2 
and simply reexecute the original switch routine. 

The routine will look like this: 

LDA FLAG 

JZ SKPIT 

LDA FLAG2 

STA SKPIT-4 

JMP NTLWR + 5 • - 

Now it is time to plan the installation portion of our project 
and to determine how to get our little routines into the DUMP 
program. Obviously, we won't be able to insert them into the 
middle of DUMP somewhere, since DUMP, being a COM file, 
has all of its memory reference instructions set up with hard 
addresses. If, for example, we were to shift everything down 
even one byte, nothing would any longer be in the place that 
corresponds to the addresses. 

So, how do we install our routines? Usually, the most effi- 
cient way is to determine where such a routine should be in- 
stalled and replace the instruction (or possibly up to three in- 
structions) with a call or jump instruction to the new routine. 
Those instructions we replace will have to be repeated in the 
routine so that everything that was being done before is still be- 
ing done. While it is easiest to do this with source listings, it is 
entirely possible to do it strictly using the disassemblies pro- 
duced by the L command of DDT after loading the file. 

As a first step, then, let's take a minute to bring up DDT 
and DUMP.COM and look over the DUMP code. If you get con- 
fused as to what you are seeing, go ahead and refer to the list- 
ing of DUMP.ASM, but try first to do it on your own. 

Invoke DDT by simply typing its name. After the prompt 
appears, use the I and R commands to get DUMP.COM into 
memory. The I command, which stands for input, is always 
used with a file name and extension. Its effect is simply to 
place the file name into the file control block, FCB, located at 
hex address 5C. 

The FCB is what CP/M uses to open files and otherwise 
read, write, or manipulate them. The structure of the FCB is 
shown on page 3-46 of volume one of the SoftCard manual, and 
you can see from that that the file name starts at 5D and 
makes up eight bytes in ASCII, with any leftover bytes (in 
case the name is shorter than eight characters) padded with 
ASCII spaces. Following these eight bytes are three more 
bytes that make up the file extension, again in ASCII with 
spaces, if necessary, to make up any extra positions. 

Number's Up. After you have performed the I command 
(using the file name DUMP.COM as follows: IDUMP.COM), 
use the D command to display the memory beginning at 5C. 



You'll see a number followed by the ASCII values for DUMP'S 
file name. The number you see is the number of the drive 
CP/M will use to access the file. In this case, it will probably be 
a zero, meaning that CP/M is to access the currently logged-in 
drive. A value of 1 would cause CP/M to access drive A no mat- 
ter which drive was logged in, a 2 would cause CP/M to access 
drive B, and so on. If your copy of DUMP is on a different drive 
than the one you are logged into, take the time now to change 
this byte with the S command to the appropriate number for 
that drive. 

Now that we have the FCB set up properly, we'll use the R 
(for read) command to read DUMP.COM into memory. Note 
that the file you load does not have to be a COM file ; It can be 
any file type you wish. 

The R command has a default load address of 0100 hex, 
meaning that an R by itself (followed by a return, of course) 
will load at OlOOH the file named by the current FCB. It is pos- 
sible to load elsewhere, however, by placing an offset value, 
expressed in hex, following the R command. The offset value 
will be added to the default of OlOOH to produce the actual load 
address; for example, an RlOO will load the file at 
OlOOH-l-OlOOH or 0200H. This capability is useful when you want 
to connect two files together, as we shall see. 

Do the R command. Now that we have DUMP in memory, 
let's list the first part of it with the L command and see if we 
can spot where to link in our routine. Notice that the first few 
instructions deal with placing new values in the stack 
pointer [SP]. 

To avoid overflowing the normal system stack (by placing 
too many values on it with PUSH instructions or by using too 
many nested call statements) , programmers working in CP/M 
often set up their own stack area, loading the [SP] with the top 
address of this area at the beginning of the program, saving 
the old [SP] value, and then restoring it when finished. This en-

ables them to take as much space as they need for the stack 
without having to worry about overflow. 

Note the new value being placed into the stack pointer at 
the fourth instruction down. Since this will be the top of the 
stack, all values stored in the stack will work down toward the 
end of the program starting from here. Remember this ad- 
dress. 

Tracing the Call. Next, we see that there is a call instruc- 
tion. By listing the code at the address referenced by the call, 
we see that a system call is being made there (the MVI C,n and 
the CALL 0005 are what tell us this) . We see that the value OFH 
is being placed in [C] as the function number. Looking in the 
manual, we learn that function 15 is the open file function. So 
this routine is the one that opens the file we are to DUMP. 

Listing again at OlOOH, we find that the next instruction is a 
CPI OFFH (comparing the contents of [A] with the number 
OFFH) . The manual tells us that if after a system call to open a 
file the [A] register contains OFFH, then the file could not be 
found. Knowing this tells us that if the zero flag in the [PSW] is 
set following the compare with OFFH, then the file couldn't be 
found; if the zero flag is not set, it means that the file was 
opened properly. 

The next instruction is a JNZ to address OllBH, which tells 
us that if the zero flag is not set (the file open was successful) , 
then we go to OllBH; otherwise, we execute a CALL and a 
JMP. It's obvious that CALL and JMP are used to exit the pro- 
gram ; from using DUMP with a bad file name, we see that this 
involves printing an error message and returning to CP/M. 

At this point, we're ready to select the point at which to link 
in our routine. Since if we want hard copy output, it makes lit- 
tle sense to print an error message on the printer, it would be 
best to link in our routine after the file has been opened suc- 
cessfully. We can see that the instruction located there is an 
LDA 0F3BBH (or a MVI A,80H if you are using the unmodified 
version) . Since we have to replace this instruction with a call to 
our new routine, and since CALLs require three bytes, the call 
'addr' will exactly replace the LDA 0F3BBH. In the unmodi- 
fied version, the MVI A,80H is only two bjdes, so we'll have to 
look at the next instruction, which we see is a STA 'addr'. That 
instruction is three bytes, so it will be the one we replace. It 
should be noted that we could have removed both of them if 
necessary (five bytes), replaced them with our call 'addr' 
(three bytes) , and filled in any appropriate leftover space with 
single-byte NOP instructions that do not affect the operation of 
the program. 

Who Goes There? In either case, since we'll have to take 
this replaced instruction and do it in our routine, it's important 
to know what the instruction does. In the modified version, it 
loads the [A] register with the value of the card type in slot 3, 
which is going to be used by subsequent instructions to deter- 
mine how to format the output. In this case, then, we need to 
return to where we left off with the appropriate value in [A], 
meaning that we want this instruction at the end of our routine 
just before we return. 

In the unmodified version, we are storing the contents al- 
ready in [A] to some address. In this instance, then, we must 
place the instruction at the beginning of our routine so that the 
proper value gets stored there. We need to make certain that 
[A] (or any other register whose contents we will be altering) is 
not used further on as is, or else we will have to save it (or 
them) at the beginning of our routine and restore them before 
we return. By far the safest way to proceed is to save every- 
thing at the beginning of such a routine and restore at the end, 
but good planning can avoid the need for this. 

Now that we know how we're going to link in our first two 
routines, we need to know how to link in the exit routine that 
switches the vectors back. We know that if the open file rou- 
tine failed, we did a call and then a jump. It is logical to as- 
sume that the address used by the JMP is the key to finding the 
program's normal exit routine. Listing the code at this ad- 
dress, we find a call, a load of [HL] from the location used to 
save the [SP], an SPHL that exchanges the contents of [SP] and 



[HL], and then finally a simple RET. 

Since this routine was reached with a JMP and not called, 
and since the programmer was careful to return the stack to its 
proper location before the RET, we can assume that the pro- 
grammer has chosen to exit the program by returning to the 
CCP. This is one of two ways to return to CP/M. The other is a 
JMP 0000, which causes a warm boot. 

In any case, we now know where the end of the program is. 
Which instruction do we replace? Really, we could replace ei- 
ther the LHLD or the call. Since we have not been careful 
about saving register contents, however, replacing the LHLD 
would involve more effort than replacing the call. We can as- 
sume this because there is no reference to any other registers 
before the RET, meaning that the call probably doesn't leave 
important contents in them. If we wanted to take the time, we 
could verify this. We'd find that the call was only to a routine to 
print a pair of CRLF's, but in this case we can assume it's okay 
simply to replace it with a call to our routine and re-create it at 
the beginning of our routine. 

Our routine, then, now looks like this: 



( note that this is where you 
would insert the STA instruction 
if you ore working with the 
unmodified version of DUMP)

Mind Your^ 




BY PETER OLIVIERI 




Welcome old and new friends. We have a variety of topics to 
discuss this month. 

Applications. Arthur D. Little is among the world's oldest, 
largest, and most diversified science, engineering, and man- 
agement research and consulting organizations. Headquar- 
tered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, its services range from 
basic and applied research in the physical and biological sci- 
ences to the formulation and implementation of economic de- 
velopment programs. The firm performs product and process 
development, engineering design, market and marketing re- 
search, analysis and design of inventory control and informa- 
tion handling systems, and a wide variety of other planning 
studies. 

The Arthur D. Little Management Education Institute is a 
wholly owned subsidiary of its parent company. The institute 
was developed to provide educational programs for helping 
participants (mostly managers from countries all over the 
world) learn to formulate policies and strategies in interna- 
tional economies. In addition to the master of science in man- 
agement degree program, the institute offers a variety of 
specialized programs and seminars. 

Apples Abound. Where does the Apple come in? In short, 
everywhere. Indeed, it is the many different ways the Apple is 
used at MEI that makes this application so unique. 

First, there is the academic role for the institute's Apples. 
Managers who attend the institute learn to use the computer in 
two separate phases. Early in the program, they participate in 
an intensive "computer week," during which the fundamental 
concepts of computers and programming are presented. Later 
on, they learn to use specific packages, such as VisiCalc and 
some database management systems. Students get hands-on 
experience and come away with an appreciation of what the 
computer can and cannot do. 

This valuable experience is gained in a microcomputer lab 
set up at the suggestion of Dr. Arnold Weinstein, dean of MEI. 
The lab has ten Apple II Plus computers, each with a disk 
drive and printer, set up in individual work stations. The lab is 
open both to students and to staff, which extends the Apple's 
role far beyond instruction. 

Seminars have also been held to acquaint staff members 
with the major features of the Apple and to teach them to use 
VisiCalc. Managers, consultants, and secretaries have dem- 
onstrated enthusiasm for the seminars and have beg^un to think 
of ways that the Apple could be put to good use in their own 
work. 

Merging Traffic. One current application at MEI is budget 
maintenance, using a VisiCalc model developed by a member 
of the staff. This model monitors the monthly appropriations 
and expenditures in a large number of categories. Another 
staff member uses the database system PFS (Personal Filing 
System) to keep track of the status of proposals solicited by 
consultants assigned to various sections. The system records 
data about the client, the client contact, the MEI staff mem- 
ber responsible for the proposal, the dates and amounts in- 
volved, and so on. Each week, reports are generated that dis- 
play the status of the various proposals — which ones have be- 
come cases and how much money has been expended on them. 
A variety of reports, such as listings of all the cases assigned to 



particular staff members, can be printed on demand. 

As you might expect, the Apple is also used to record stu- 
dent grades and to produce official transcripts. This is accom- 
plished by user- written programs. One program accepts grade 
data about a student and files it ; another program reads the 
file, performs the appropriate calculations, and produces the 
final transcript. The institute takes advantage of user-de- 
veloped programs that calculate class rankings, instructors' 
grade rosters, and the dean's list. 

A New Breed? MEI is contemplating the possibility of com- 
bining a commercial database package with the programs 
they have already created. The fact that many database pack- 
ages now allow interfacing with user- written programs makes 
this idea attractive. MEI people could use a commercially de- 
veloped package to create and update their data and then use 
their own specially developed programs to access the data and 
print their own reports. 

An observer sitting in the MEI computer lab on a typical 
day would be struck by the many things going on there. One 
person might be in the process of developing a VisiCalc model ; 
another might be creating a "learn about the Apple" program 
for a client in Saudi Arabia. A student might be examining the 
possibilities for using the Apple to manage a South American 
farm, while someone else is in the middle of a statistical anal- 
ysis or financial modeling application. You might even come 
across a group of people assigning probabilities to the out- 
comes of various moves in Cranston Manor. 

Quite a variety of applications under one roof, isn't it? And 
this is all the more striking when you remember that MEI is 
but one small section within the Arthur D. Little consulting or- 
ganization. 

Speaking of Training. All too often, we think of training 
only in terms of formal educational programs like seminars and 
workshops. Most organizations also have their own informal 
training programs, and certainly all organizations have train- 
ing needs. The Apple can be a valuable resource in this re- 
gard, as some examples demonstrate. 

The Regional Kidney Disease Program in Minnesota has 
developed an Apple-based interactive video system as an aid 
in training nurses and medical technicians. Because the com- 
puter keeps track of each student's progress, instructors know 
which students need their help most and can plan accordingly. 

The American Heart Association uses Apples (again with 
videotape) to teach proper cardiac-pulmonary resuscitation 
techniques. The Apple II system controls the exchange of stu- 
dent-patient responses. 

Apples are also being used to train airline pilots, military 
personnel, and customer service representatives in various 
organizations. What makes these applications possible is the 
ease with which users can create their own instructional pro- 
grams. You don't have to be a programmer to create your own 
training programs. You can use various commercial pro- 
grams designed to make your job easier. 

The programs in the Apple Pilot family (from Apple Com- 
puter) are particularly valuable. These include Apple Pilot, 
Apple Co-Pilot, Apple Super Pilot, and Apple Super Pilot Log. 
Apple Pilot and Apple Super Pilot are powerful yet easy-to- 
leam languages that allow you to use simple commands to

create instructional programs. Co-Pilot is a tutorial for Pilot. 
Super Pilot Log is a student record keeping system that works 
with Apple Pilot and enables you to monitor students' prog- 
ress in training programs. 

This family of products allows you to take advantage of 
some effective training aids, including sound, color graphics, 
and interactive videotape or videodisc. The packages are easy 
to use and their only real limits are your own creativity in 
using them. 

Another program worthy of your consideration is The 
Learning System (Micro Lab) . The Learning System is a pack- 
age that allows you to create multiple choice, matching, or fill- 
in tests. In addition to providing hints to students, if required, 
the program monitors student progress. Though not as com- 
plete as the Apple Pilot family, The Learning System is rela- 
tively easy to use and has a good many worthwhile applica- 
tions. 

And Now a Word from the Apple Network. Simply put, a 
network is a system for linking several computers together. It 
is one way to bring computer power to a group of people (per- 
haps several of the people in your office). In a typical net you 
might find several Apples, each with its own disk drive, con- 
nected to a hard disk. The centralized storage the hard disk 
provides enables users to share data and programs easily. 

Networks offer several advantages. To begin with, aU mem-

bers of the network have their own microcomputers. This 
means that people don't have to share time on the computer, 
although they can easily share data if necessary. If one per- 
son's computer breaks down, no one else is affected. Another 
convenience is that a computer can be removed from the net- 
work and used alone. Finally, the cost of networking is often 
significantly less than the cost of time sharing on a main- 
frame, especially since members can share expensive pieces 
of peripheral equipment such as hard disks, printers, and 
plotters. 

CPU Computer Corporation recently announced the avail- 
ability of a local network that can be used when computers are 
located within four thousand feet of each other. The firm's soft- 
ware is called CPUnet and permits up to sixty-three personal 
computer users access to as many as eighty million charac- 
ters of data on a Corvus hard disk, as well as the data on their 
own floppy disk. The package is CP/M compatible and easy to 
operate. 

We'll be talking more about networks in the future; in the 
meantime, if you are considering the installation of a multi- 
user system, you may want to talk with someone from CPU. 

It Figures. Every now and then a product comes along that 
is sufficiently general and useful that it warrants a place in 
every Apple owner's library. VisiCalc is a good example of 
such a program; it enables you to do powerful spreadsheet 
analyses yet is relatively simple to use. VisiCalc's applica- 
tions are limited only by the imagination of the people who 
use it. 

Another such product has arrived. It's called MatheMagic 
and, as its name implies, this program performs magic with 
math (International Software Marketing). 

We live in a mathematical world. Unfortunately, many of 
us are math illiterates. Envision, if you will, having the ability 
to create formulas, enter them into the computer once, and 
then recall them as needed, with the computer asking you for 
the appropriate values in a given formula each time. This is 
precisely what MatheMagic allows. 

Let's demonstrate. A calculation that is quite useful but 
often difficult to do, even with a calculator, is determining the 
future value of an investment. Since all of lis have the formula 
for this calculation on the tips of oior tongues, we'll recognize 
immediately that it is: 

Future Value = Principle / (1 + interest/N) (N * years) 

In this formula, N represents the number of compounding 
periods each year. So assuming that you have an Investment 
on which interest is compounded monthly, your Interest would 
be equal to 12. If your investment interest were compounded 
quarterly, N would equal 4, and so on. Years is the length of the 
investment in years, the * represents multiplication, and the / 
represents division. As you can see, the exponent (that ia,N * 
years) can become quite large. 

This sample problem is a perfect candidate for computer 
solution. In fact, you can write a Basic program to solve this 
program on an Apple. The beauty of MatheMagic is that you 
can quite easily give the Apple instructions to solve this prob- 
lem. It's just as if MatheMagic had written the Basic program 
for you. 

Your session would be as simple as this. After booting 
MatheMagic you're presented with a menu. In this case, you 
would select option F (for formula) and be met with a second 
menu. Here you would choose the C (for create a formula) op- 
tion. You would then simply enter the formula you wanted, us- 
ing words that have meaning in the context of the application. 
You would type : 

Principle * (1 +lnterest/N) (N * Years) 

When you press return, a three-part screen is presented. 
The top part displays the available commands, the middle part 
the ongoing solution to the formula you're using, and the bot-

torn part is where you're asked to enter the values for your for- 
mula. 

At this point press the / (slash) key (the calculate com- 
mand), and MatheMagic spins its magic. The display area 
places a flashing cursor over one of the unknowns in your for- 
mula and you are asked to "enter value for principle." 

After you've done this for all your unknowns, your answer 
appears in the display area. You can, of course, save formulas 
and recall them for later use. One formula can also reference 
another; for example, one of the unknowns in your formula 
could be another entire formula (you'd be prompted for the ap- 
propriate values). 

As you can see, this package has myriad applications. 
MatheMagic requires either Apple II with Applesoft in ROM 
and at least one disk drive (having two is preferable). A 
printer would also help. 

Some special features of this package are : 

1. The package's helpful menus. All one letter commands 
are displayed in full though you need only enter the first letter, 
for example, (C)reate. In fact, sometimes you need only 
press return to accept a default entry. Unlike VisiCalc, which 
displays only the single letters of the commands, MatheMagic 
displays the full command words continuously. 

2. There is an on-line help feature for all MatheMagic com- 
mands. 

3. Up to nine different users can use a single disk. The sys- 
tem gives each user a unique identification number. This is a 
nice feature where more than one person might need to use the 
package. 

4. The user may select the number of decimal positions to 
be displayed in answers. 

5. A special feature called "ask variable" essentially al- 
lows the user to ask "what if?" questions as a formula is being 
solved. For example, "What if the length of my investment is 
two years?" Answering these questions is easily accom- 



plished with MatheMagic. 

6. Formulas can be solved all at once or one step at a time 
showing all the interim steps. While you would probably not do 
it all the time, you're likely to find it fascinating to watch 
MatheMagic solve a formula in steps. 

7. You can easily edit and update any of the formulas that 
you have stored. 

8. Interaction with the disk for loading, storing, and delet- 
ing formulas is quite simple. 

9. There are twenty-one built-in functions (ABS, SQR, LOG, 
and so on) . 

10. The documentation includes a user guide and sample ap- 
plications. 

Indeed, several features demonstrate that extensive fine 
tuning went into MatheMagic. These will be left to the investi- 
gation of the interested user. 

If you work with formulas at home, at work, or in school, 
you should not be without MatheMagic. It is indeed a pro- 
grammable calculator. Its strength is that it is quite easy to 
use and has a tremendous variety of applications. Like 
VisiCalc, a database management system, or a word proces- 
sing program, MatheMagic makes an excellent addition to 
your Apple library. 

Once again we have reached the end of a month's column. 
The Inquisition analyses are now in the final stages, evalua- 
tions of various word processing packages are well underway, 
and the Apple IH (with ProFile hard disk) is being put through 
its paces. Looking forward to sharing some of our findings with 
you next month. Take care for now.

Exploring 
Exploratorium 



Museum of the Future 




BY HATTHEW YUEH 



Clap your hands and colored lights ripple from the bottom 
of the Enchanted Tree to the top. Take a spin on the Momen- 
tum Machine and feel your momentum increase. Create with 
your hands a visual echo on the Pin Screen, an exhibit of 
170,000 pins inserted into a screen. Experience the Ames Room 
where children become adult-size and grown-ups shrink. 

Walk into the Exploratorium and you enter a playground 
for the senses. When you visit this science museum, you don't 
observe the exhibits, you do them. 

It's not often you visit a museum where you actually manip- 
ulate the exhibits yourself, but the Exploratorium, located in 
the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, is one place where 
that's possible. Visitors to the Exploratorium push, pull, 
scream, talk, bounce, and swing their way to a better under- 
standing of the world around us through more than five 
hundred participatory displays. 

Things That Go Bump in the Night. We often fear things be- 
cause we don't understand them: the creakings of an old 
house, an automobile engine, electrical storms, even com- 
puters, to name a few. Founded in 1969 by noted physicist 
Frank Oppenheimer and his wife Jackie, the Exploratorium 
was conceived in the belief that forces of nature that at first 
seem mysterious can be understood and that if we under- 
stand such things we won't be as apprehensive of our sur- 
roundings. 

The Exploratorium provides the tools and environment for 
such learning, and Apples are among those tools. Filled with 
ingenious exhibits that enable visitors to learn about light, 
color, vision, sound and music, patterns of motion, electricity. 



heat, touch, and animals, it offers experimental opportunities 
that are difficult, sometimes impossible, to achieve through 
classrooms, books, or television. 

On the Waterfront. The entrance to the Exploratorium is a 
side door that could easily be mistaken for an entrance to an 
old storage warehouse. But once inside, you realize that what's 
in store is more than just a warehouse. Originally the show- 
room of fine art from all over the world for the 1915 Panama- 
Pacific Exposition, the hangar-sized hall later housed tennis 
courts and then a fire station; it now serves as a place of par- 
ticipatory learning. 

Most of the exhibits are constructed in-house based on ideas 
from the staff, although some ideas are contributed by re- 
search laboratories, university teachers, other museums, and 
even by visitors themselves. Carpentry, graphics, electronics, 
machines, and welding shops are fully exposed so the public 
can see exhibits being made and repaired. This is to em- 
phasize that everything experienced at the Exploratorium is 
natural; there are no tricks involved. 

The original theme of the Exploratorium was human per- 
ception, and it hasn't drifted far from that in its thirteen years 
of operation. 

The one-hundred-foot-long Echo Tube demonstrates the 
principles of sound and air waves. You can stick up to half your 
body into this tube and clap, tap, speak, whistle, or scream and 
hear the sounds bounce back at a moment's delay. Step next 
into the Distorted Room, one with no right angles, and you'll 
feel yoiirself become disoriented. 

Everyone Is You and Me is a fun display that demon- 
strates the principle of one-way glass by allowing two people to 
see both their faces blended into one, with hilarious results. A 
strobe light flickers almost xmnoticeably, making a crude 



spray of water appear as a smooth stream snaking its way up- 
ward. 

Hands-Off Learning. And what would a science museum be 
without computers? There are eight Apples at the Explor- 
atorium, three donated by Apple Computer and five pur- 
chased by the museum. But you won't find anyone playing 
Choplifter, Knight of Diamonds, or any other Apple games 
here; in fact, you won't find anyone using these computers at 
all. Rather, it is the Apples themselves that control several of 
the exhibits. 

One of these is the Speech Dissector, which records, plays 
back, and picks apart a person's voice and plots a graph to 
show how much emphasis the person gives to certain parts of 
words. 

Hot Light demonstrates how concentration of a light 
bulb's energy varies at different levels of brightness by plot- 
ting a graphic representation of the light's different inten- 
sities. 

Survival of the Fittest employs an Apple for data manip- 
ulation to teach the concepts of exponential growth, using 
animal reproduction as a model. 

In all three of these exhibits, the Apple is pretty much a 
number cruncher, doing equation manipulation and data re- 
porting—stuff it was made for. But three other exhibits in- 
volve the Apple in musical and artistic creation. 

Coming Together. From its inception, the Exploratorium 
has invited artists to work at the museum. Currently, the art- 
ist-in-residence program assists four to six artists per year. 
Each brings to the museum ideas that are reviewed by an out- 
side selection committee. 

One of the artists currently in residence is Paul DeMarinis. 
He's responsible for the Music Room, a chamber housing 



Clockwise from left: Recollections by Ed Tonnenboum transforms 
participants into hl-res humans; youngsters examine their voices with 
Speech Dissector; ortist-in-residence Paul DeMarinis creates music at 
the touch of his hand; at Everyone Is You and Me, similarities are 
explored; Hot Light graphically plots light; Delayed Speech 
can amuse and confuse; Stereo Sound helps visitors understond 
aural perception. 

five touch-sensitive guitarlike instruments that visitors can 
pick up and experiment with. "They're not really five sepa- 
rate instruments," DeMarinis explains, "but, rather, one in- 
strument that takes five people to play." 

The gtiitars have twenty-three touch-sensitive keys on the 
neck and eight on the body. They can be played by touching 
the keys individually or by running over them with your 
fingers. 

Each guitar is scanned for changes in the controls every 
three milliseconds by a single-board computer made by John 
Bell Engineering. The computer then transmits the infor- 
mation to an Apple II Plus, which controls four Casio MT-30s 
and a Korg rhjrthm synthesizer. DeMarinis also designed his 
own interface card that allows the user to record and play back 
music made with the system. 

"The idea for these began when a partner, David Behr- 
man, and I were using synthesizers in performance," De- 
Marinis recalls. "Turning knobs and pushing levers, we just 
didn't get the feeling of actually playing music." 

The purpose of the Music Room is to allow people — even 
those who have no musical or technical experience — to pick up 
one of the guitars and begin creating. Of the five modules, one 
controls both rhythm and tempo, complete with percussion 
fills, and one dictates the key and key changes. Controlled by 
these two, the other three are used to create melodic lines.

And Going to Pieces. Another Apple-driven exhibit is Dis- 
cemibility, a display created by electronics and video artist Ed 
Tannenbaum. When you visit this exhibit, you sit in front of a 
touch-control grid and vary time, color, and resolution of your 
facial image on the screen before you. Resolution varies from 
almost photo-perfect to a grid of four black and white blocks. 
Now that's lo-res. 

You can also delay replay of your image, allowing you to 
see history of movement. "I began wanting to play with var- 
ious aspects of recognition between high and low resolution, 
positive and negative images, and grace steps in movement," 
says Tannenbaum. "The purpose is to point out that we don't 
occupy only space, but time as well." 

Taking the principles of Discemibility further, Tannen- 
baum came up with his latest work. Recollections, a much 
larger and more sophisticated display of body motion that 
turns participants into performers. Recollections uses an 
Apple for program control and a video camera to record in 
color the head-to-toe movement of anyone who stops to have a 
little fun. 

The visitor's antics and movements become a sequence of 
images that are stored and then replayed onto a life-size screen 
to create the illusion of a colorful wake left by that person's 
body. It's just as much fun for spectators; they can watch the 
action live or on a television screen. 

"One of the wonderful and interesting things about this is 
that people who tend to be a little inhibited step in front of this 
thing and suddenly open up," Tannenbaum observes. "Again, 
here, the visitor can see the various aspects of both space and 
time that he occupies." 

Participants of Tannenbaum's Recollections jump, sway, 
and dance themselves into artistic creation as video sculp- 
tures, seemingly in a private world, and always with a sense of 
wonder. 

Opening the Black Box. Though most of the exhibits seem 
puzzling to the senses, some to the point of almost defying 



them, none of the displays allows the visitor to leave without 
knowing what actually happened. Each display is accom- 
panied by two cards: the first, "To Do and Notice," gives in- 
structions on how to work the exhibit; the second, "What Is 
Going On," explains the phenomenon involved. Even the child 
who doesn't take the time to read will have fun with the exhibit 
and probably come away with some new knowledge. 

The atmosphere at the Bxploratorium is informal. There 
are no guards and few rules. Visitors who have problems or 
questions can turn to "Explainers," high school students 
whose job is to circulate among the crowd and offer as- 
sistance. 

The Exploratorium encourages school groups, which can 
make reservations to visit the museum during the mornings. 
The groups are greeted by college-age Explainers who dem- 
onstrate some of the exhibits and who meet and talk with 
teachers. 

But field trips are too brief to explore the Exploratori- 
um fully. To provide more in-depth instruction, the Explor- 
atorium conducts classes in which students spend an entire 
day at the museum once a week for five weeks. Students meet 
with teachers in a classroom and use the exhibits as their per- 
sonal laboratory for experimentation and learning. There's 
also a lending library of props available that students may 
take home. 

Plenty Is Not Enough. Stopping in for only an hour is worth- 
while, but even a whole day at the Exploratorium is not enough 
time to see or play with everything. The staff at the Explor- 
atorium understands this, and encourages visitors to return by 
honoring a paid admission for six months. 

For visitors to San Francisco, it's easy to visit the Golden 
Gate Bridge and then take a short hop to Fisherman's Wharf 
and Ghirardelli Square. 

But it's an even shorter hop to the Exploratorium, a place 
where adults can be kids, kids can be kids, and both can dis- 
cover the wonder of learning.

More tips from the authors of Beneath Apple DOS . . . 

Ba^ of Trkks 

By Don Worth and Pieter Lechner 

Now there is more from the authors of the best selling book Beneath 
Apple DOS— four comprehensive utility programs on disl<ette and 
over 100 more pages of valuable information about the Apple ll's 
disk operating system. 

BAG OF TRICKS is useful to beginners and experienced programmers 
alike. It includes many "hand holding" tutorials that assist you in 
repairing damaged diskettes and allow you to change sector ordering, 
reconstruct blown catalogs, etc. etc. etc. At the low price of $39.95, 
BAG OF TRICKS is one of the best software values ever. 

The four programs and their functions are: 

1. TRAX dumps and examines a raw track, either 13-sector or 16- 
sector, displays the internal Apple diskette formatting 
information, and flags exceptions to standard formats. 

2. INIT will reformat one or more tracks, attempting to preserve 
the contents of undamaged sectors. It also allows you to change 
sector order. This can cut disk access times by 40% or more! 

3. ZAP is a sector editor like no other! More than 50 commands are 
available to assist you to locate, compare, change, or print the 
data on your diskettes. ZAP is even programmable! Using 
powerful macros, it is possible to transfer and compare DOS, 
CP/M, or PASCAL files. 

4. FiXCAT automates the process of repairing a damaged diskette 
catalog. It operates with or without user intervention, locating 
"lost" files and rebuilding the catalog— from scratch if necessary! 
DOS removal and VTOC repair are also possible.

You've conscientiously worked your way through the Ap- 
plesoft Tutorial and have completed all the exercises. You've 
drawn a blue horse with a white face and orange feet in lo-res 
graphics and plotted lines in hi-res mode. You've been intro- 
duced to strings and arrays, for /next loops, and subroutines. 
You're ready to solo, right? 

Maybe. Maybe not. But you do know that you've got more 
to learn, so you turn to the other three instruction books that 
came with your system : the DOS Manual, the Applesoft Basic 
Programming Reference Manual, and the Apple II Reference 
Manual. And all of a sudden you realize that, like it or not, 
you're up there all by yourself, coming home on a wing and a 
prayer that none of the worms (they're the gremlins inside Ap- 
ples) types int or fp before you have a chance to save your 
program. 

"Int?" "Fp?" You don't remember those commands from 
the Tutorial? Don't worry; your memory's not going. They're 
not there. They're also not in either the big Applesoft manual 
or its Integer Basic equivalent, even though their purpose is to 
switch between Applesoft Basic (floating point, hence fp) and 
Integer Basic and back. You'll find int and fp in the DOS 
manual because, for some reason (probably an afterthought) , 
they're loaded and stored with DOS. Use them with care. 
They'll zap any Applesoft or Integer Basic program in 
memory. 

Look! It's the End of the World I So you're up there on your 
first solo when your disk drive starts grinding and clacking so 
loudly that you think it's blown a gasket, the thermometer 
reads ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit, and the local power 
company has just announced that there will be a brownout in 
ten minutes. In panic, you circle in a holding pattern (for 
"Help!" = 1 to 65536 . . . next "Help!") while you thumb 
through three unfamiliar new manuals looking for the com- 
mand you need. Eventually you either land safely or you 
crash. And eventually you teach yourself how to program. 

Although there have been courses in programming for 
years, programmers are largely self-taught. An instructor or a 
tutorial can only take you so far. After that, it's your own abili- 
ty to hold a couple of hundred partially completed ideas in your 
head and do mental JSRs (assembler jargon for jump to sub- 
routine) between them until it's all a coherent whole. But until 
the personal computer came along, there was an intermediate 
stage between the tutorial or classroom and going solo — help 
from friends and colleagues standing around the community 
printer waiting for their output from the mainframe comput- 
er. If your program bombed, somebody nearby could help. 

Even now that the principle of one person/one computer 
has been established, it is still possible to learn from others. 
One way of learning is by analyzing canned programs. Analyz- 
ing other people's programs — whether those programs are 
good, bad, efficient, or sloppy — helps you become a better pro-

grammer. So, from time to time in this column we'll present a 
program for you to enter (and run, so that you know what it 
does) . Then we'll analyze it to see how it does what it does. 

Here's one that assumes you know the commands covered 
in the Applesoft Tutorial but haven't gotten very far yet with 
the bigger Basic programming reference manual. It intro- 
duces a few new commands and concepts beyond the tutorial. 
Although it happens to use some mathematics (high school trig 
level) , you can ignore that and concentrate on the program- 
ming. "Those of you who care about the math will find it dis- 
cussed later on in this piece. 

Plotting a Piece of Paradise. Let's build a garden. Type the 
following program carefully and save it. As you know, every 
comma and colon must be right. Don't try to understand the 
program as you type. Wait until after you've seen it run. When 
you're finished and have proofread your work, go to the run- 
ning instructions that follow the listing and, when prompted, 
enter the numbers given here. Be patient. The program is ex- 
cruciatingly slow to run. That's part of the lesson. Later we'll 
make some changes to speed it up.

Punished typing? Saved the program on a disk? Okay, now 
run it. Be sure to follow the instructions in the next paragraph 
exactly. This is a demonstration program, not a polished com- 
mercial one, and an error may cause it to bomb, in which case 
you'll have to run it again. 

When the prompt asks for (1) flower or (2) worm, push 1. 
Note that you do not have to push return. When it next asks for

parameters, type 25,95,10. You will need a return this time. 
You'll see why you need it for one and not for the other when 
we analyze the program. 

Now sit back for an incredibly long time and watch the pro- 
gram draw a flower on your screen (bird's-eye view). If it 
starts drawing a curve, just wait. Go to the kitchen to get a 
beer or a Coke. Wait for the prompt again. Then type 1 again 
for flower and 75,45,35 for the next set of parameters. Wait. . . . 
After you regain control, draw one more flower using parame- 
ters of 35,240,40; this time use the second hand of a watch to 
time how long it takes. Wait, cursing us for wasting so much of 
your time. When the program finishes, you should have three 
flowers in three sizes on the screen. 

Getting Down to the Dirt. Gardens can't live by flowers 
alone. They also need worms to aerate the soil. This time push 
2 for worm and choose as parameters 10,210,100. This one will 
plot in much less time. When it's done, type N for no new fig- 
ure. Don't hiit reset or turn off the machine yet. Wait. When the 
program finally stops running, you'll see that we've just drawn 
the Garden of Eden. 

Let's analyze our program. Notice that the first sixteen lines 
are all ten numbers apart, which, as you know, is good pro- 
gramming practice because it allows you to insert other lines 
later. Actually, at one time in the writing of this program, sev- 
eral lines were inserted and 63,97, and 999 were used. Later the 
numbers were changed with the renumbering utility program 
we talked about last month. Line 160, end, signals the end of the 
main program and the start of the subroutines. Although not 
always necessary (as in this program), the use of end is con- 
sidered a good programming practice because it ensures that 
the first subroutine won't mess up your output when it's acci- 
dentally run an extra time and then followed by a printed re- 
turn without gosub error. 

You'll notice that the program has no rems. They're not 
needed because any programmer can tell at a glance what 
each section does by looking at the line numbers. The 1000

group is for the first subroutine, the 2000s are for the second 
and the 3000s are for the third. Notice also that the subroutines 
are at the end of the program. Although the program would 
run faster if they were at the beginning (using a goto to get 
around them when the program starts running), this, too, is 
typical practice. It's also an anachronism that dates back to 
the days of Fortran programs on punched cards when subrou- 
tines had names rather than numbers and when their decks 
had to physically follow the main deck. 

Line 20 contains the first new command, get N; it's also 
used in line 110, get A$. Get is like input except that you don't 
need return with it, and the character you type doesn't show on 
the screen or mess up a neatly printed report. Get gets only the 
first character typed rather than a whole word. Getting ar- 
rows, commas, colons or certain control characters may give 
bizarre results and, according to Apple Computer, if onerr go- 
to is in use, get errors will cause your system to hang after ei- 
ther two or forty-three of them happen. 

This Could Be Courting Disaster. Although both lines 20 and 
110 work, the first get is considered poor programming while 
the second is okay. The first is numerical (N = 1 or 2) and is 
the condition that allows your system to hang when onerr is on. 
The second is a string (A$ = "Y") , which doesn't have the same 
drawbacks but introduces others; for example, using more 
than two or three if-then tests on string variables in the same 
program will cause a crash, according to Apple, but this 
limitation doesn't apply to if-gotos. 

Line 30 should be old hat by now, while line 60 contains the 
second new command, on N gosub 1000,2000,3000. This com- 
mand looks at the value of N (1 if you choose flower in answer 
to the get of line 20) and goes to the first line number in the list 
if N = 1, to the second if N = 2, and so on. It's exactly the same 
as 10 ifN = 1 goto 1000/20 ifN = 2 goto 2000, and so on. Thus, if 
you choose flower and push 1, the program will jump to the 
subroutine beginning with line 1000. A similar command is on 
N goto, which branches the same way but, since there's no sub- 
routine, doesn't come back. 

Line 50 is a standard loop. The choice of 0 to 360 simply 
sends the program around a complete circle of 360 degrees. 
Line 60 illustrates a strange peculiarity of Applesoft : it doesn't 
understand degrees. For some unknown reason, the author of 
Applesoft decided to measure angles only in radians, wliich 
are each approximately 57.295 degrees long. This line then 
converts an angle of Z degrees into one of ZR radians. 

Lines 70 and 80 are error traps. We'll define fn X(Z) -I- XO 
and fn Y(Z) + YO in a minute. Right now just think of each as X 
and Y, whose values will be plotted on the screen just as if the 
screen were graph paper. 

Apple's hi-res screen goes from 0 to 279 horizontally and 
from 0 to 159 vertically. If you try to plot outside these ranges, 
you'll get an error message and a crash. These lines allow the 
program to accept plot instructions outside the legal ranges 
and then to branch around the plot command to increment the 
loop by one. The number 140 was chosen for the largest value 
on the Y axis to keep the figures above the text window at the 
bottom. 

Funny You Should Ask. "Above the text window?" Yup. As 
you probably know, the origin of Apple graphs is in the upper 
left comer. Therefore, Y values increase as you go down. Line 
90 then plots the values of two variables named fn X(Z) and fn 
Y(Z). We've added XO and YO, values that are entered by the 
user, to move the origin of the graph from the upper left comer to 
the point on the screen XO,YO. 

Line 110 offers nothing new beyond get and is there to plot 
that little surprise when you tliink you've told the program to 
stop. Lines 120 through 150 set the parameters for the unex- 
pected Apple. 

Line 1000 contains another new command: Deffn X(Z) = 
.... Don't worry about the math that follows. Pretend you're 
plotting a Une and let deffn X(Z) = 2*Z. Rendered into En- 
glish, this translates to "create a functional relationship be- 
tween X and Z such that, no matter what value Z takes, X will 
always be equal to twice Z." (More formally, it would be 



AUGUST 1982 



U ) F T A L K

stated: the function X of Z equals 2 Z.) To use it, we define the 
value of Z (in this case in the for/next loop) and then simply 
say print fnX(Z) when we want to know the value of X for that 
value of Z. Deffn X(Z) =2*Zis exactly the same &sletX = 2* 
Z, except that the call for the value of the function also incor- 
porates a gosub so that you don't have to make the program 
run directly past the functional relationship each time you 
want to solve it with a new value for Z. 

Each of the three subroutines then defines a functional re- 
lationship that is to exist between X, Y, and Z. This permits one 
loop with instructions to plot an apparently undefined general 
relationship, fn X(Z), which was actually defined earlier. 
When we wish to change this relationship to plot a worm or an 
apple, we redefine it, first in subroutine 2000-2010 and then in 
subroutine 3000-3020. 

When we timed the drawing of the flower, how long did it 
take? Your time may be different, but ours was two minutes, 
twenty-eight seconds. The culprit is our error trap in lines 70 
and 80, where the program has to make four i/ tests before it 
can plot each point. Type 70 and then 80 to delete these lines 
and time the drawing of the flower again, making sure to 
choose parameters that won't send the plotting off the screen 
(25,45,40 will work). Much faster, isn't it? 

The Truth about Traps. In terms of running time, it would 
be much better to have a separate error trap for each figure 
that could be consulted once before the plotting begins. This sit- 
uation illustrates one of the tradeoffs in programming. Al- 
though separate error traps would improve the program run- 
ning time significantly, i/" tests would then be required for each 
subroutine. You'd also need to understand the mathematics of 
the equations in those subroutines. 

The following new lines work together to trap errors for the 
flower by not allowing you to choose parameters that will later 
try to plot points off the screen. As a result of this, we're limit- 
ed to whole flowers, but we avoid the agonizing wait. We'll de- 
vote a column to errors and error-trapping later. 



1013 IF XO - A < 0 OR XO + A > 279 GOTO 30 
1017 IF YO - A < 0 OR YO + A > 139 GOTO 30 

This addition works because, in the case of the flower, the 
point XO,YO is the center while A is the length of one petal. The 
worm also becomes easy because its height is A and its length 
is 72 (.2 times 360) with an origin also at XO,YO. The apple re- 
quires 2*A in place of A in lines 1013 and 1017. Despite the extra 
effort, error traps are the mark of a pro. Somebody else using 
your program isn't going to put up with very many messages 
saying break in line nnn before telling you where to goto. 

Mathematical Appendix. All three equations are best ex- 
pressed in polar coordinates and then converted to normal co- 
ordinates by the parametric equations X = R*cos(Z) and Y = 
R*sin(Z) where R is a radius of one sort or another and Z is an 
angle in degrees. The first equation, found in subroutine 1000, 
is, in polar coordinates, R = A*cos(2*Z). It traces out a shape 
known as a four-leafed rose. The second is nothing but a sim- 
ple sine wave of the form Y = sin(X). 

Our apple in subroutine 3000 is known as a cardioid be- 
cause it also looks like a heart. Its equation is R = A*(l -I- 
cos(Z)). The stem is a straight line hplotted in line 150 from 
the origin to a point whose distance away is a function of the 
parameter A to keep the size of the stem proportionate to that 
of the figure. 

Cardioids actually lie on their sides with the indentation fac- 
ing to the left. Normally, a complicated translation of the axes 
would be required to get a cardioid apple-side up. Instead, a lit- 
tle trick was used. Because the Apple's coordinate system has 
its origin in the upper left comer, all that was necessary was to 
swap the X and Y axes and let Applesoft turn the figure upside 
down automatically. That's why fnY(ZR) shifts to the cosine of 
Z (and fn X(Z) to the sine) in subroutine 3000 instead of follow- 
ing the other two subroutines. 

Enough of math for a while. Next month: Letters to Dear 
Appley. 



APPLE SPEAKS 
INTELUGENTLY! 



The people who dared to teach Atari to talk are again 
challenging the microcomputer establishment with the 
VOICEBOX Speech Synthesizer for Apple. This low cost intel- 
ligent peripheral can speak thousands of words unassisted, 
generated directly from its firmware ROM dictionary lo- 
cated on its plug-in card. This means that speech, with 
variable intonation and speed, can be used in any of your 
apple programs without ever having to bother loading a 
disk. And, in case you want to expand your dictionary to 
include unusual words or words in foreign languages, you 
can easily define them with our 64 phonemes and store 
them by the thousands on one of the six special dictionaries 
provided for on our disk. 

In addition your VOICEBOX for Apple can be easily coded to 
sing on key with uniform barlengths and you can store 
(record) your songs on disk, retrieving and modifying sec- 
tions whenever you want. With the disk system, you'll also 
enjoy an educational random sentence generator and 
graphic speech animation! The VOICEBOX for Apple will 
run on 32K Apple II with Applesoft or Apple II Plus systems 
equipped with sixteen-sector disk drives. VOICEBOX for 
Apple comes with loudspeaker and disk. The Alien Group 
also makes a less expensive VOICEBOX for Apple with all 
features (including expandable disk dictionary), but ex- 
cluding firmware ROM and singing capability. Speaker is 
optional on this unit. 




For Atari users, 
the VOICEBOX for 
16K and up Atari 
plugs directly into the 
serial port. No extra cables are 

needed and no speaker is needed since the speech comes 
directly over your TV monitor. This unit has all speech syn- 
thesis features except singing and firmware ROM.

Last month we presented a general introduction to PROMs 
(programmable read only memory) and EPROMs (erasable 
PROMs) . We also reviewed three boards that allow you to pro- 
gram EPROMs with your Apple, and three cards you can use 
to interface PROMs and EPROMs with your Apple through 
one of the expansion slots. 

This month we'll give a more technical description of the 
procedures for programming both the Texas Instruments 2716 
and the Intel 2716 EPROMs. Then we'll explain why Micro- 
products 's EPROM programmer is designed to work only with 
Intel chips and how you can modify it to work with Texas In- 
struments's EPROMs. 

Giving Personality to an EPROM Programmer. The 
Microproducts EPROM programmer is designed to program 
only +5- volt EPROMs. But by making a few modifications, 
you can use this board with a variety of EPROMs. 

Refer to figure 1 for the pinouts of the EPROMs we will dis- 
cuss this month. As you can see, nineteen of the twenty-four 
pins have the same function for all EPROMs. The remaining 
five pins reflect the differences between IK and 2K chips and be- 
tween Intel (-I-5V) and TI (+12V, +5V, -5V) types. Note that 
some pins may have a different function during programming 
than they have when reading. 

All EPROMs require a relatively high voltage during pro- 
gramming. This is necessary in order to create a strong field 
that places charges into the floating gate region of the cells 
that are to be programmed to the zero state. 

Judging by figure 1, it would appear that only a few minor 
wiring modifications are necessary to program any EPROM. 
But there is also a major difference in the way high voltage is 
used to program the various EPROMs. To be more specific, 
let's examine the programming requirements for the Texas In- 
struments and Intel 2716s.

Programming the TI 2716. The procedure for program- 
ming the Texas Instruments 2716 is as follows. First pin 24 
(Vcc/PE) is brought to either -I- 12V or ground to convert the 
data pins to inputs. Next, the address and data lines are set up 
with the proper information. The address lines specify which 
byte vdthin the EPROM is to be programmed, and the data 
lines determine the bit pattern for the eight cells at that loca- 
tion. After information on these lines is stable, a 26-volt pro- 
gram pulse is applied to pin 18 (CS/program) . The duration of 
this piilse should be between 0.1 and 1 millisecond (msec.) . The 
address is then changed to the next sequential location, the 
new data is set up, and another program pulse is applied. This 
procedure must be continued until all 2,048 bytes have been 
programmed (one loop) . The entire sequence is then repeated 
again and again until the number of program loops multiplied 
by the program pulse vndth is greater than 100 msec. Thus a 
minimum of 100 loops is required to program the EPROM. 
When the last loop is finished, pin 24 is brought back to -I-5V, 
which takes the device out of the program mode. 

Programming the Intel 2716. To program the Intel 2716, pin

21 (Vpp) is brought to -I- 25V. Then the address lines are set up 
with the location to be written, and the data is presented to pins 
9-17. Once the address and data are stable, a 50-msec. high 
TTL pulse is applied to pin 18 (PGM). This location is now 
completely programmed and we can move on to the next — not 
necessarily sequential — location to be programmed. Note that 
anywhere from a single byte to all 2,048 bytes can be pro- 
grammed at one time. Bringing pin 21 low disables any fur- 
ther programming. 

Making a Universal Programmer. With all this informa- 
tion at hand, we can see the basic differences in the methods of 
programming the Texas Instruments and Intel EPROMs. In- 
tel requires a steady 25-volt programming source with a TTL 
pulse, and TI uses a 25-volt programming pulse. Intel also pro- 
grams each address once with a 45 msec, pulse while TI uses a 
1 msec, pulse and must program the entire chip many times in 
succession. 

The Microproducts programmer is designed only for Intel- 
type EPROMs, so we need to modify both the hardware and 
the software in order to use it with TI EPROMs. Fortunately, 
the hardware required to make these changes is fairly simple. 
To get the most from the programmer, the company decided 
that all modifications would be made through the use of an 
added IC socket and DIP component carriers. With those 
changes, the programmer could work with all of the EPROMs 
mentioned.

cept for +5V, which is needed anyway) . The remaining wiring 
is done with 30-gauge wire- wrapping wire, soldering point to 
point. The only components added to the board are one IC and 
three resistors, which can easily be supported on the back side 
of the circuit board. These parts take the 25 volts from the on- 
board upward converter and generate the 25- volt pulse. An ad- 
ditional resistor is added to the component carriers for the Tl 
personality modules to change the programming pulse from 45 
msec, to 1 msec. The schematic in figure 2 illustrates these 
changes.

Software Modifications. Using the existing EPROM mover 
program would be sufficient except that it would have to be nin 
more than one hundred times. With its present timing charac- 
teristics, that would make programming time unbearably 
long. Therefore, two changes are made — the delay time be- 
tween changing addresses is shortened and a small looping 
routine is added to make the mover program execute 125 times 
and then stop. These changes are made from the Apple's ma- 
chine language Monitor as shown below. 

Modifications to the EPROM Mover Program. The 
EPROM mover program supplied with the programmer loads 
in from $800 to $9FF. To create a new version for use with TI 
EPROMs, use the following procedure: 

1. Load the mover program from tape or disk. 

2. From the Monitor {call— 151 if necessary) , enter the fol- 
lowing steps: 

*853:4C F6 <return> 
*85B:15 <return> 
*9DA:EC 09 <return> 

*9EC: 48 A9 7D 8D 01 OA 68 4C 2D 08 <return> 
*:CE 01 OA 10 03 4C 51 09 4C 2D 08 <return> 

3. Save the new version.

To tape : *800.A00W <return> 

To disk : *3D0G <return> 

>BSAVE EPROM.MOVER.TI, A$800, L$201 <refurn> 

Similar changes can be made in the Microproducts 4 Char- 
acter Assembler to enable its EPROM burner feature to work 
properly. If you have the newer 6 Character Assembler, use 
the OBJ pseudo-op to deposit the program in RAM; then use 
the mover program to burn the EPROM. 

Armed with these programs and the individual personality 
modules, you can now program any of the 2708/2716 family of 
EPROMs. Simply insert the EPROM and its corresponding 
module and then run the appropriate program to bum the 
EPROM. When the program finishes, your code is then per- 
manently (that is, until erased) stored in EPROM.

For the first time, Amper-Magic malies it easy for people who don't l<now 
machine language to use its power. Now you can attach slick, finished machine 
language routines directly to your Applesoft programs in seconds! And interface 
them by name, not address! And pass parameters directly, just like with Applesoft 
commands! 

You simply give each routine a name of your choice, perform the append 
procedure once, and the machine language becomes a permanent part of your 
BASIC program; no more separate BLOADing programs! (Of course, you can 
remove any subroutine if you want to.) 

Any number of relocatable machine language routines can be attached to an 
Applesoft program and then called by name. We supply over 20 machine language 
routines on the disk. You can enter more from magazines. And more library disks 
are in the works. Some routines on this disk are: 



Binary file info 
Delete array 
Disassemble memory 
Dump variables 
Find substring 
Get 2-byte values 
Gosub to variable 
Goto to variable 



Hex memory dump 
Input anything 
Move memory 
Multiple poke decimal 
Multiple poke hex 
Print hex $ 
Print string 
Print w/o word break 



Remove characters 
Restore special data 
Search string array 
Speed up Applesoft 
Speed restore 
Store 2-byte values 
Swap variables 



These routines and more can be attached and accessed easily. For example, to 
allow typing of commas and colons in a response (not normally allowed in 
Applesoft), you simply attach the Input Anything routine and put this line in your 
program: 

XXX PRINT "PLEASE ENTER THE DATE. "; : & INPUT.DATE$

□ Over Here. Foreigfn competitors, 
claiming superior research and develop- 
ment of new technology, have long been 
threatening to outpace American com- 
panies in the marketplace. 

Several large American semicon- 
ductor companies have joined to form the 
Semiconductor Research Cooperative to 
beef up basic research in universities. 
Moimting foreign competition and a 
shortage of highly trained engineers and 
scientists are seen as the symptoms ; not 
enough money for research is the 
disease. 

Carried out through contracts with 
universities and nonprofit research or- 
ganizations, the research cooperative's 
emphasis will be on long-term projects of 
three to ten years' duration. Sponsored 
by the Semiconductor Industry Associa- 
tion in Cupertino, California, the Semi- 
conductor Research Cooperative's chair- 
man is Erich Block of IBM. The pro- 
posed budget for the first year is six mil- 
lion dollars. 

Integrated circuit use, design, and 
manufacture will be a main focus of ef- 
fort in the program. Computer-aided de- 
sign and the use of materials like gal- 
lium arsenide for advanced chips are 
possible research subjects. Participat- 
ing companies theoretically will be able 
to use the results from participating uni- 
versities in product development and 
the creation of advanced technology. 

But those results may be a while com- 
ing. In the beginning, participating com- 
panies' financial contributions will look 
like prepayment of royalties. Nonethe- 
less, the cooperative has reportedly been 
greeted with enthusiasm in both aca- 
demic and semiconductor circles. 

□ Maybe Next Year. According to Coop- 
ers & Lybrand, the world's largest ac- 
counting firm, there are three kinds of fa- 
vorable tax treatment available to buy- 
ers of computer software as the result of 
the Economic Recovery Act. 

The Los Angeles based firm says the 
most aggressive method is to treat the 
costs of purchased but customized soft- 
ware aa a current expense. If it can be 
shown that the risk of the usefulness of 
the software is borne by the taxpayer, 
such costs are deductible for tax pur- 
poses. 

You may also be entitled to a re- 
search and development tax credit for 
the cost of software if you capitalize the 
amount and amortize it over the useful 



life. The IRS has attempted to treat com- 
puter software as an intangible asset if 
bought separately from hardware. In- 
tangible assets are eligible for amortiza- 
tion over a short life, as opposed to being 
depreciated over five years, under the 
tax laws. 

If the software can be classified as 
tangible personal property, an invest- 
ment tax credit and a five-year depreci- 
able life are available. To achieve this, 
off-the-shelf characteristics must be 
identified — the software must be pur- 
chased as a standard program package. 

Personal computer owners as well as 
businesses should be able to take advan- 
tage of these tax benefits. David Oifer, a 
partner in the firm, maps out a course of 
action: "It clearly is in the interest of the 
taxpayer contemplating purchase of 
computer software to review the tax situa- 
tion involved and incorporate tax plan- 
ning into the contractual agreement with 
the software vendors." 
□ Innovative Wrongdoing. The Ameri- 
can Academy of Achievement had its 
twenty-first annual Banquet of the Gold- 
en Plate June 26 in New Orleans, Louisi- 
ana. The affair "salutes captains of 
achievement from America's great 
walks of life and honor students from 
across the nation." Apple board chair- 
man Steven Jobs was in attendance to 
address the young honorees. 

"One of the funny things about being 
bright," he observed, "is that everyone 
puts you on this path— go to high school, 
go to college . . . but you might want to 
think about going to Paris and being a 
poet for a few years, or go to a Third 
World country. See lepers with their 
hands falling off. Fall in love with two 
people at once." 

Another funny thing about being 
bright would appear to be an unusual 
sense of what is alluring. 

Jobs continued: 

"If you're going to do things that are 
innovative — connect two experiences to- 
gether — you can't go after the same bag 
of experiences that everyone else does or 
you're going to make the same connec- 
tions everyone else does and you're not 
going to be innovative. 

"We're all taking things from the 
usame giant pool. The most ecstatic feel- 
ing in the world is to put something back 
in that pool." 

Dr. Marvin Minsky of MIT's depart- 
ment of artificial intelligence recalled, 



"The first time you do something, it's aw- 
ful. I simply taught myself to like suffer- 
ing and to like doing things badly for a 
while. You look at the difference in the 
improvement and it's gfreat; it's fun. It's 
a lot better than doing something well. 

"Computer science is going to be the 
largest industry in the world ... it hasn't 
flattened out; it's going to grow for the 
next fifty years and the next three hun- 
dred years, because computers are going 
to start cleaning the floor, filling pot- 
holes in the street — and that's going to be 
our salvation. 

"There's something called basic re- 
search that is suffering very badly in this 
country, and I want to encourage some of 
you to get into that; to say, 'Am I doing 
something that's going to make funda- 
mental advances in all fields, or is it just 
a little bit of marketing or engineering 
that makes a gadget?' " 
□ Bencher Liberation. Before elegant 
became another buzz word for expensive 
when applied to cars, watches, and con- 
dominium living, the word was (and still 
is) a mathematical term for precision, 
neatness, and simplicity. 

Elegance is more than just a word in 
the world of computer design engineer- 
ing, it is a necessity. If anj^hing needs to 
be elegant today, it is the tiny chips and 
circuits that populate computers. 

Achieving a refined gracefulness of 
concept comes only after much hard 
work. The pursuit of elegance is a com- 
bination of experience, intuition, and per- 
sistence. It can often result in a moment 
of Zenlike satori, or enlightenment, as en- 
gineering solutions seem to appear mag- 
ically on a complex schematic drawing. 

All this— providing the designers 
aren't too involved with tedious clerical 
work to notice. Theirs is a world of refer- 
ence manuals, standard formulae, and 
specification sheets. A lot of pencils get 
pushed as designs are manually checked 
for errors, corrected, and modified, 
usually a three to four week process. At 
the. b^nch level of engineering, between 
the logic capture, the documentation, and 
the calculation, who has the time for ele- 
gant thinking? 

Today's computer market demands 
competitive innovation; compeuiies are 
pressed to be the firstest with the most- 
est. This is making products more com- 
plex than ever before, yet they seem to 
have a shorter life span. Second genera- 
tion products are released seemingly be-

fore the first are settled on the shelves. 

Computers themselves have been 
gradually taking over the back end of the 
computer design task during the last dec- 
ade. Developing prototypes and manu- 
facturing are two areas man has grad- 
ually given over to the machines. The 
front end of the design business, at the 
bench where the engineer works, is the 
next area scheduled to be opened up to 
microtechnology, freeing the designers 
to do what they do best: design. Spend- 
ing less time calculating and capturing 
logic, they'll spend more time thinking 
through implications, analyzing their 
work, considering alternatives. . . . 

In other words, thinking elegantly. 

The engineering system that can do 
this job has been introduced by Mentor 
Graphics of Portland, Oregon. Called the 
Idea 1000, it's the first totally integrated 
computer-aided engineering system. Its 
credentials: local processing and mass 
storage at each work station, interactive 
simulation, and high-speed local net- 
working with a distributed database. Log- 
ic designs can be created, captured, 
analyzed, verified, and documented by 
computer — tasks previously done by 
hand. 

All of this can now be done before any 
prototype is constructed, and done in 
minutes and days instead of days and 
weeks. 

The Idea 1000 system consists of an 



Apollo Domain computer, its Aeg^s 
operating system, and six application 
software packages. It can be used aa a 
stand-alone engineering station or as 
part of a network of as many as two hun- 
dred stations. The system's power grows 
with each new addition, unlike most mi- 
cro or mini processor networks. 

The applications progframs are : 
Structured Logic Design, an intelligent 
graphics editor that creates and cap- 
tures logic diagrams; Interactive Logic 
Simulation, which can build designs 
either top-down or bottom-up; Project 
Communications, with electronic mail 
capabilities; Document Preparation, 
which integrates text and graphic infor- 
mation; Outputs, which transfers de- 
signs to other systems or simulators ; and 
a custom application program that al- 
lows designers to write their own analy- 
sis routines. 

Statistics show that design engineers 
only spend 50 percent of their day 
actually designing. The other half is 
taken up with paperwork. The Idea 1000 
looks as if it's going to alter this ratio 
radically. 

An elegant solution, don't you think? 
□ Pass the Chips. According to some 
estimates, sales of 64K djTiamic RAM 
chips will reach one billion units per year 
by mid-decade. Not quite an industry 
standard yet, 64K RAM chips posted 
about $100 million in sales during 1981. 



Intel has just announced the release of 
its second-generation 64K dynamic RAM, 
the 2164A. The company's first-genera- 
tion product was withdrawn from the 
market because of difficulties encoun- 
tered in certain memory system appli- 
cations. Intel decided to go ahead with 
the second-generation product rather 
than spend money to correct the first one. 

Intel's innovative use of redundancy 
is one of the most interesting features of 
the 2164A. Basically, a redundant device 
has extra columns or rows. When lead- 
ing-edge technology products like the 
2164 A are made, any minor extraneous 
impurity in the basic silicon wafer can 
cause failures to occur in specific bit 
areas. Redundancy eliminates the re- 
quirement to dispose of an entire chip 
when there's a processing error in a 
single bit. Because extra rows and col- 
umns exist, a bad bit location can be dis- 
abled and a new site included. 

The 64K chips are expected to be the 
largest memory market in history. In 
1977, 4K RAM chips hit their peak sales of 
$145 million. The peak year is projected 
to be 1982 for 16K chips, with sales close 
to $500 million. The acceleration pro- 
gression gains emphasis when you con- 
sider that Intel introduced the first IK dy- 
namic RAM in 1970. Now, industry-wide 
sales of 64K dynamic RAM chips are esti- 
mated to peak at $1.5 billion in 1985 or 
1986. 3i

Cr Applesoft 



When last we met, we designed a memo minder, a worthy 
and estimable project indeed, but one that fell just a trifle short 
on color graphics. So this month, in retaliation, we'll return to 
graphics, the principal reason so many of us chose the Apple in 
the first place. 

As you probably remember, the Apple has two graphics 
modes. Applesoft contains a set of commands for drawing and 
manipulating shapes in the high-res mode. These commtmds 
(our only new vocabulary for the month) are : 



SCALE 



ROT 



DRAW 



We're going to draw what are called vector shapes and save 
them in tables in the computer's memory. The Applesoft man- 
ual contains a whole chapter dedicated to a discussion of these 
shape tables, a chapter that should receive the Warren G. 
Harding Memorial Award for Obfuscation through Indirection 
and Vagueness. 

Vector shapes are shapes that are drawn with short lines 
(vectors) rather than with dots. One advantage of drawing 
shapes with vectors is that you can scale them up or down in 
size rather easily. For example, if you want to make a shape 
twice as big, you just double the length of each of the lines in 
your shape. Another advantage is that you can rotate the shape 
on the screen fairly simply. We'll be discussing how to do both 
of these manipulations in a little bit. 

Right now we're going to build a program that lets us draw 
a shape and manipulate it on the screen. Next month we'll 
write a program to handle most of the detailed pencil work that 
goes into creating a shape, but we'd better work our way 
through the process by hand first, just so nobody thinks that 
it's all done by voodoo (although a strong argument to that ef- 
fect can still be made). 

A shape table can contain any of eight different com- 
mands. Half £ire move commands; the other half are plot and 
move commands. Each heis a numerical value, as shown in 
table 1. 

Dot, Dash, Dot. Imagine that you have a cursor on the hi-res 
screen. The move commands will cause the cursor to move 
one dot in the appropriate direction. The plot and move com- 
mands will plot a short line from the current position to the 
next dot in the appropriate direction. 

Your entire shape can be made up of a series of these com- 
mands. If you have graph paper available, you can figure out 
your shape by sketching your object on the graph paper and 
then redrawing it in connect-the-dots fashion, waving a single 
line along the lines of the g^raph paper, using move and plot as 
much as possible and move only whenever you need to lift your 
pencil from the paper. 

In this manner you should be able to convert your sketch in- 
to sequence numbers. Let's take an example. Look at this sim- 
ple shape: 



If we want to convert this cross to a shape table, we'll have to 



Move Only 


Plot and Move 


Up 0 


Up 4 


Right 1 


Right 5 


Down 2 


Down 6 


Left 3 


Left 7 . 



kyDougCarlston 



follow the motion of our pencil as we draw the cross. Imagine 
that we start by placing our pencil at the bottom of the vertical 
line. We then move upward three dots. Translated into shape 
table commands, that means that we move and plot upward 
three times (giving as the first three numbers in our prelimi- 
nary shape table : 4,4,4) . We might then move twice to the left 
without plotting (3,3) , then downward once without plotting (2) 
to position ourselves for the cross stroke. We can then finish it 
off with fovir move right and plots in a row (5,5,5,5). Our pre- 
liminary table, when finished, would look something like this: 

4,4,4,3,3,2,5,5,5,5 

This is a preliminary shape table, not a finished one. We 
still have some work to do on it. The first thing we want to do is 
compress its format so that it doesn't take so much memory 
(computer people are very thrifty) . Now it happens that every 
byte of memory can store an integer from 0 to 255. Therefore, it 
occurred to one of Apple's thrifty founders that it would be 
possible to store at least two of these shape table digits in each 
byte. With this in mind, we are going to do a little manipula- 
tion that turns each pair of numbers into a single large 
number. 

First off, let's divide our preliminary table into pairs ; thus : 

4,4 
4,3 
3,2 
5,5

Now we'll convert each pair into a single number by multi- 
plying the second number by 8 and then adding in the first one : 



4,4 


4 + (8 * 4) = 


36 


4,3 


4 + (8 * 3) = 


28 


3,2 


3 +(8 * 2) = 


19 


5,5 


5 +(8 * 5) = 


45 


5,5 


5 + (8 * 5) = 


45 



Now We're Cooking. You can easily separate out the first 
and second digits from these new numbers — just divide by 8. 
The remainder is the first digit; the quotient is the second digit. 

Next there are a few trimmings to add, and then our shape 
table is done. Every shape table needs a table of contents at the 
beginning. This consists of four numbers if the table has only 
one shape in it (it can have as many as 255) . 

The first number is the number of shapes in the table. The 
second number is completely irrelevant and is stuck in merely 
as evidence that, however thrifty programmers may be, they 
are nonetheless human and foul things up on occasion. Most 
people just type a 0 here, but you can actually type any num- 
ber you please. 

The third and fourth numbers act as a pointer telling how 
far it is from the beginning of the shape table to the beginning 
of the first (and, in this case, only) shape in the table. Take the 
first number in this pair and add it to the product of the second 
number times 256, and the result tells you how far it is from the 
beginning of the shape table to the shape you are looking for. In 
the case of a shape table containing only one shape, the dis- 
tance is always 4, but if you had two shapes you would have to 
figure the length of the first shape in order to calculate the 
starting point of the second one. 

This is not of great importance to us now, since we are only 
going to build a one-shape table. However, it should be clear that 
a shape table can get a lot more complicated if you build a 
table with many shapes in it, since the table of contents needs a 
pointer to the beginning of each shape. We'll have to come 
back to this and look at it in greater detail some other time. But

for the time being, what we've done here will suffice. 
Our shape table now looks like this: 

1 0 4 0 36 28 19 45 45 

We have to add one last thing: a zero at the end of the table. 
Then we're done ! Now all that remains is to figure out what to 
do with it. (The use of a zero to indicate the end of a shape in a 
shape table does have one unfortunate consequence that we 
ought to mention before we go on — ^the move up command is a 
0, and if you use two move up commands in a row, you could 
generate a 0 in your table that would be mistaken for an end-of- 
shape zero. So don't.) 

Hide and Peek. Shape tables generally get poked into some 
unused part of your Apple's memory for later reference in 
your program. There are several good places to put such 
tables. If you have a very short one, you can sneak it into the 
beginning of page 3 ($300 hex or 768 decimal) , which is right be- 
low the text page area. Or, if you have more than 16K of RAM 
in your Apple and are not going to be using your second hi-res 
page, you can load your table at $4000 hex (16,384, for those 
who persist in thinking in decimal) . A third good location, if 
you only have 16K, is just underneath the hi-res pages, say 
$1D00 (7,424 in decimal). Let's use 7,424 for this example. 

Here's one way to poke the table into memory: 

10 FOR X = 7424 TO 7433: READ A: POKE X,A: NEXT X 
20 DATA 1,0,4,0,36,28,19,45,45,0 

Now we have to tell the Apple where we've hidden the shape 
table. (You might think your Apple would be aware of our ef- 
forts to date and might be sufficiently astute to have figured 
out what it is we're trying to do. Although it is undoubtedly true 
that all Apples are not created equal and that some are more 
perceptive than the rest, it is too much to expect the garden va- 
riety Apple to follow this column with a great deal of compre- 
hension, particularly considering the subtle allusions and deli- 
cate nuances that color so many of our discussions.) 

There's a pair of memory locations in which Apples custom- 
arily keep the starting address of shape tables. They are 
decimal locations 232 and 233. The reason you need two memo- 
ry locations to store a single address is simple : one memory lo- 
cation (called a byte) can only store a number between 0 
and 255. 

In order to store a big number (like 7,424, for example) , we 
have to use two bytes. The way we do this is similar to the way 
we "unpack" the pairs of numbers in shape tables. First we di- 
vide our big number by 256. Then we poke the remainder into 
location 232 and the quotient into 233. This allows us to store 
numbers up to 65,535 in a pair of bytes (which just happens to 
be all of the addressable space in a 48K Apple). 

So let's do it. Dividing 7,424 by 256 we get 29, with no re- 
mainder. So we add the following statement to our program: 

30 POKE 232,0: POKE 233,29 

Now we're ready to draw our shape! Here's a little pro- 
gram that does just that: 

40 TEXT: HOME: INPUT"SCALE = ";SC 

50 INPUT "ROTATION = ";RT 

60 INPUT "COLOR = ";CLR 

65 HGR: X = 100: Y = 100 

70 SCALE = SC: ROT = RT: HCOLOR = CLR 

80 DRAW 1 AT X,Y 

90 GET A$: GOTO 40 

Lines 70 and 80 contain all the new vocabulary. You can fiddle 
with scale and rot when you run the program. Scale sets the 
size of the shape and runs from 1 (small) to 255 (very huge). 
Zero is treated as the largest size of all, so it is best ignored. 
Rot runs from 0 to 64. The number of actual rotation positions 
increases as the scale increases. Fine adjustments of rot at the 
smaller sizes will not result in any changes at all. 

Line 80 uses the draw command. Read it like this: draw 
(shape number) 1 at (x coordinate) 100, (y coordinate) 100. 
You may want to play with this routine some by putting lines 70 
and 80 in a loop and gradually changing the values of X, Y, SC, 
RT, and CLR. 

Next time we'll design a little utility that helps us put shape 
tables together and save them to disk or tape. In the mean- 
time, practice up on those shape-drawing commands!

AUGUST 1982 




Last month, we promised you a few more Apple utility pro- 
grams. Well, stay tuned; we'll get to them in a paragraph or 
two. But first, we've got some mysteries of the month to un- 
ravel. 

Pr#4 Mystery. In April, we scratched our heads over this lit- 
tle two-liner: 

10 PR#6: REM DISK DRIVE SLOT 
20 PR#4: REM EMPTY SLOT 

The question is, why doesn't running this program boot your 
disk when line 10 is encountered instead of (apparently) jump- 
ing to line 20 and hanging there because of the empty slot? And 
why, if you delete line 20 or trace the program, does the disk 
then boot? We were swamped with answers and comments 
ranging from, "Come on, that's easy I" to, "I give up; helpl" 
Everyone who figured it out seemed to agree on this rather 
machine-langnage answer. 

All the command pr#6 does is store a number ($C600) in 
page zero at locations $36 and $37. Slot 6 will not be activated 
until something, an5i;hing, is printed via COUT. Without line 20 
(which stashes a $CM:00 at $36 and $37), a carriage return is 
printed. With trace in effect, line numbers are printed. If you 
add just this line: 

15 PRINT 

the program behaves more "logically," booting your disk as 
expected and never encountering line 20. Thanks for all your 
input on this one, but where were you the following month? 

Is-the-Printer-On? Mystery. In May we asked if anyone 
knew a way, under program control, to detect a printer that is 
turned off (or simply not connected) and to print a message to 
that effect on the screen. Most programs skid to a hanging halt 
when an off-line printer is encountered, often leaving you won- 
dering what's wrong. Most Softalk readers were apparently 
mystified, avoiding this challenge like the mnemonic plague. 
But a few of you realized that there is indeed a way to do it. It's 
as simple as this: 

1010 VTAB 21: PRINT "PLEASE TURN ON YOUR PRINTER." 
1020 PR#1: PRINT 

1030 HOME: REM CONTINUE PROGRAM 

If your printer is on, the screen message from line 1010 will be 
printed, but will be erased immediately by line 1030 's home. If 
your printer is off or disconnected, the program will hang but 
the message will stay on the screen! Almost too easy, isn't it? 
You can use this as a subroutine every time a program starts 
to print. It's one more way to make your printer programs 
more friendly. 

You'll find another interesting mystery at the end of this 
column. See if you can crack it. But now, on with the utilities. 



necessary, annoyance that we're about to do away with. When 
you catalog a disk and the screen is full of file names, the 
catalog routine pauses, waiting for a keypress before it contin- 
ues with the next "page" of file names. But if you don't want 
the catalog to continue, you must (gasp!) hit reset. The dis- 
agreeable things about this procedure are: 

1. the top file name sometimes scrolls up out of sight — ^in- 
convenient ; 

2. you get two flashing cursors on the screen — messy; and 

3. the beep wakes up my dog Sophie — dangerous. 

It's possible to venture into the Monitor and make some al- 
terations. Why not? Don't be afraid if you're not experienced at 
machine language ; just read and type along. Things won't get 
too technical. Type these two direct keyboard commands: 

CALL -151 (return) 
AE2FL (return) 

What you just did is enter the Monitor and list part of DOS's 
catalog routine, the machine language instructions that tell 
your Apple what to do and when to do it. Notice the fifth line 
after your AE2FL command: 



AE39- 



20 OC FD 



JSR $FDOC 



Note: This utility requires a 48K Apple 
with standard DOS in memory. 



This is the command that triggers the screen-full pause. It 
says, "Jump to the SubRoutine at location $FD0C" (that's 64780 
in decimal). From an Applesoft program, you would say call 
64780. Your program would halt until any key was pressed and 
then continue. 

Calling It Quits. Let's change our machine language in- 
structions by adding a little subroutine that quits the catalog 
procedure if control-C is pressed and continues it if any other 
key is pressed. The first question is, where do we put this sub- 
routine? Inserting it just anywhere between other commands 
is not as practical in machine language as it is in Applesoft. 
Page 8-37 of Beneath Apple DOS reports that locations $BA69 
through $BA95 (47721-47765) are unused in DOS 3.3. This is a 
handy location for very small subroutines because it's pro- 
tected by DOS — it won't be erased by normal programming 
procedures. Let's change the catalog routine so it jumps to the 
"empty" location, $BA69, instead of to $FDOC. From the 
Monitor type: 

AE3A: 69 BA (return) 

Repeat the list command, AE2FL (retiirn), and notice the 
change in the fifth line, which now reads: 

AE39- 20 69 BA JSR $BA69 

If you were to catalog a disk now (don't do it yet) with more 
than one page of file names on it, your Apple would crash into 
the Monitor (requiring you, in this case, to reboot) because 
you'd have caused a jump to an unprogrammed location, 
$BA69. Before cataloguing, let's install our subroutine. 

Eiiter the Monitor if necessary (call -151 again) and care- 
fully type : 



Cat Killer. DOS's catalog routine features a minor, but un- 



BA69: 20 OC FD C9 83 DO 03 4C 2C AE 4C 3C AE 00 (return) 



184 



\ o r T A I 1^ 



AUGUST 1982 



Be careful; those Os are zeros, not letter Os. And be sure to type 
the colon and spaces exactly as shown. Now list what you've 
just entered by typing: 

BA69L (return) 

The top five lines on the screen should read: 



BA69- 


20 


OC 


FD 


JSR 


$FDOC 


BA6C- 


C9 


83 




CMP 


m2 


BA6E- 


DO

BNE 


$BA73 


BA70- 


4C 


2C 


AE 


JMP 


$AE2C 


BA73- 


4C 


3C 


AE 


JMP 


$AE3C 



Simply stated, line 1 says, "Wait for a keypress." Line 2 says, 
"See if the key pressed was a control-C ($83 or 131)." Line 3 
says, "If it wasn't a control-C, jump to line 5." Line 4 says, 
"Jump to location $AE2C (which continues the catalog proce- 
dure) ." 

Reenter Basic by typing: 

Control-C (return) 

Now catalog a disk with at least a couple of dozen file names on 
it. After the first pause, type a control-C and watch as a nice, 
tidy (and silent) prompt and cursor appear! You may even 
type control-C while the catalog is printing. 

To accomphsh the above DOS patch, we had to change the 
values of sixteen memory locations. Well, there's more than 
one way to kill a catalog; you can produce the same effect with 
sixteen Applesoft pokes. Put these pokes in a disk's greeting 
program and Cat Killer will be in effect whenever you boot that 
disk: 

1000 POKE 44602,105: POKE 44603,186 

1010 POKE 47721,32: POKE 47722,12: POKE 47723,253: 

POKE 47724,201: POKE 47725,131: POKE 47726,208: 

POKE 47727,3: POKE 47728,76: POKE 47729,44: 

POKE 47730,174: POKE 47731,76: POKE 47732,60: 

POKE 47733,174: POKE 47734,0 

These pokes write our changes into memory only. To write 
them permanently onto a disk, simply execute the pokes, then 
init a new disk. 

Well, as they say, one good tip leads to another, and here's 
another. 

Cat Tracer. Apple users everywhere use this catalog trick, 
and the Cat Killer program just given makes it work even 
better. 

To access a file from a catalog that appears on the screen, 
hit control-C (if you have no prompt and cursor) and move the 
cursor up next to the file's name by hitting escape and t5^ing I 
as many times as necessary. Then type the appropriate DOS 
command (run, load, bload, delete, or whatever) and trace 
over the file name using the repeat and right arrow keys. Hit 
return and you've executed the command without having to 
type the file name! It's fast, it's easy, and it's almost impossi- 
ble to misspell a file name. Long file names become much 
more practical this way. If an error occurs (assuming there 
aren't any hidden control characters in your file name) , you 
probably traced over one or two sector numbers after your 
DOS command. You need to erase these numbers as you meet 
them by typing between the DOS command and the file name. 

Just for fun, here's a little non-DOS trick that won't let you 
execute a file name trace. It serves no practical purpose 
(except maybe as a practical joke), but give it a try anyway: 

10 PRINT CHR$(4); "CATALOG" 
20 FOR X=l TO 47 STEP 2 

30 S = SCRN(7,X): IF S=12 OR S=13 THEN COLOR = S-4: PLOT 7,X 
40 NEXT X 

After running this program, try to trace your cursor over one 
of the file names. Good luck! The plot statement in line 30 con- 
verts the first character of each file name to a visible control 
character (on the screen, not on the disk) — and you can't trace 
over a visible control character! 

Exec Lister. Last month, we fooled around with DOS's exec 
command. Among other things, exec lets you call upon a series 
of commands that you've stored on disk. You simply write the 



commands to disk as a text file and then exec the text file. 
There's no need to remember the commands later, and there is 
no need to load a program to do the job for you. Whatever pro- 
gram is in memory will stay intact while the text file is being 
executed. 

Let's create a utility that will send program listings to most 
printers in eighty columns. To do this, you need to communi- 
cate the following keyboard commands to your Apple: 

PR#1: ACTIVATES PRINTER IN SLOT 1 

PRINT "(ctrl-l)80N":REM TURN OFF SCREEN OUTPUT 

LIST 

PR#0: REM PRINTER OFF 

To write a text file consisting of these commands, type and 
run this program: 

10 D$ = CHR$(4): REM (ctrl-D) 

1 1 Q$ = CHR$(34): REM QUOTE MARK 

12 l$ = CHR$(9): REM (ctrl-l) 

20 PRINT D$; "OPEN LIST80": PRINT D$; "WRITE LIST80" 
30 PRINT "PR#1" 

40 PRINT "PRINT "; Q$; 1$; "80N"; Q$ 

50 PRINT "LIST" 

60 PRINT "PR#0" 

70 PRINT D$; "CLOSE" 

Running this program will write a text file on disk called 
listSO. Notice that in order to put quotation marks, CHR$(34)s, 
inside print statements, we defined the string Q$ in line 11 and 
used it in line 40. The object is to get the commands to print on 
the screen exactly as if we had tj^ed them in. 

To use listSO, load any program, especially one with some 
fat program lines, and type: 

EXEC LISTSO (return) 

To proofread an exec utility as it executes, type the direct 
command, MONICO (return) , before you exec ; this will cause 
the disk output to be printed on the screen. 

DOS Mystery of the Month. This problem actually came up 
on a rather complex mailing list program when a disk full 
error occurred. The program below demonstrates the 
dilemma just as well, but with a different type of error: 

10 D$ = CHR$(4): INPUT "TEXT:";T$ 
20 PRINT D$,"OPEN FILE" 
30 PRINT D$;"WRITE FILE" 
40 PRINT T$ 

50 PRINT D$; "CLOSE FILE" 
60 PRINT D$; "LOCK FILE" 

Run the program and enter anything you want in answer to 
text. Everything should work without a hitch; the T$ string 
from line 10 is written to the disk as a text file and the file is 
closed and locked. 

Now, run the program again. It will, of course, bomb at line 
40 because the file, "file," is locked. No problem, right? Just 
unlock the file with the direct command, unlock file (return). 
Now, to prevent T$ from losing its identity (which would hap- 
pen if you typed run), type goto 20 (return) . Now you get a not 
direct command error message. Unfair! Why are we unjustly 
accused of an illegal direct command? And more important, 
how can we get this program to continue with a goto 20 com- 
mand? If you know, (i-op me a line in care of Softalk and I'll re- 
port the results. 

Until next month. . . . 



Correction to the June 1982 DOStalk: The listing that ap- 
peared on page 192 contains a misprint in statement number 
50. It should read: 

50 PRINT "TYPE NAME #";N; 

Thanks to Paul Rego of Albuquerque, New Mexico, for 
making us aware of this error.

The Customization o f VisiCalc 



For the Apple 



BV JOE SHELTOH 



VisiCorp lonveiled VisiCalc Advanced Version and Visi- 
Schedule for the Apple HI at the National Computer Confer- 
ence in Houston, Texas, in early June. Both are aimed at the 
professional and corporate world and provide a new spectrum 
of capability for the Apple in. 

VisiCalc Advanced Version. What does a company do for an 
encore when it already markets VisiCalc, the most significant 
software ever designed for any computer? If the company is 
VisiCorp (formerly known as Personal Software), it intro- 
duces a better VisiCalc known as VisiCalc Advanced Version. 

VisiCorp introduced the original 13-sector Apple II version 
of VisiCalc almost three years ago. Since then, VisiCalc has be- 
come the best selling software product in the history of com- 
puters. It is probably responsible for the personal computer in- 
dustry having grown as rapidly as it has. VisiCalc is now avail- 
able for about a dozen different microcomputers, including the 
Apple n and the Apple III. 

VisiCalc Advanced Version is not a replacement for 
VisiCalc III. VisiCalc III will continue to be available. If 



VisiCalc Advanced Version isn't a replacement, then, what is 
it? A project manager at VisiCorp says "it is everything that 
everyone wanted to add to the current VisiCalc." That may be 
an overstatement, but the credentials of VisiCalc Advanced 
Version are impressive. 

Let's start by looking at the market. VisiCorp plans to dif- 
ferentiate VisiCalc Advanced Version from VisiCalc III by 
market area and type of user. VisiCalc Advanced Version is 
designed to be very effective in the corporate environment 
where consolidation of information from many templates in- 
creases the usefulness and power of the personal computer. 

VisiCalc III requires considerable planning and several 
steps to actually exchange or consolidate data between tem- 
plates. If you try to consolidate with the current VisiCalc, you 
must load each template, save a specified area as a DIF file, 
and then load it back into a specified area of the consolidation 
template. The more templates involved, the more difficult the 
consolidation. If you are consolidating a number of templates, 
you must go through the consolidation steps a number of times. 

VisiCalc Advanced Version employs a macrocommand 
capability called keystroke memory that automatically 
prompts you through a user-defined series of steps to effect a 



AUGUST 1982 



SOi: lAI K 



187 



consolidation. Once the process has been defined, a single key- 
stroke prompts you to insert the proper disks and then auto- 
matically loads the correct DIF file into the specified area of 
the consolidation template. It doesn't matter how many tem- 
plates are being consolidated, all you have to do is follow the in- 
structions. Now sales managers don't have to spend time con- 
solidating models from different regions, nor do they have to 
worry about training someone else to do it. Instead, they can 
have it done. Anyone can quickly learn the steps necessary to 
boot VisiCalc Advanced Version and execute the keystroke 
memory file. 

Novices May Apply. The VisiCalc Advanced Version is 
designed for a wide spectrum of users, some of whom may 
have little or no experience with VisiCalc III. 

Templates developed on the current VisiCalc aren't 
designed for the inexperienced user. Users must understand 
VisiCalc's functionality so they don't destroy a template's in- 
tegrity (that is, so they don't accidentally erase data or enter 
information into a cell that already contains pertinent for- 
mulas or information) . Users must also be familiar with the 
layout of the template in order to know where to enter the in- 
formation required, especially if information can be entered in 
many areas. 

When using VisiCalc Advanced Version, however, you sim- 
ply load the template and press the tab key to skip between 
predefined entry fields. This makes it difficult to enter infor- 
mation in the wrong cell. But even a knowledgeable VisiCalc 
user can accidentally enter information in the wrong cell given 
enough opportunity. VisiCalc Advanced Version protects 
against that possibility by allowing individual cells or groups of 
cells to be protected so that either no information or only speci- 
fied information can be entered. For example, cells can be de- 
fined so that only values can be entered. 

These capabilities result in templates that can be designed 
to enable effortless consolidation of many templates and that 



can be used by many naive users without danger of inadvert- 
ent damage. Templates designed for the Advanced Version 
can provide corporations and other environments with sophis- 
ticated applications an even better planning, forecasting, and 
"what if?" tool. 

What Else Is New? That is all well and good, but current 
VisiCalc III users want to know how VisiCalc Advanced Ver- 
sion is different. It is not different in that it keeps the tried and 
true VisiCalc features, functions, and user interface. Tem- 
plates developed for VisiCalc III are upward compatible. Any 
templates being used today can continue to be used, or even 
converted to take advantage of Advanced Version features. 

Beyond that, it is much more than just a bunch of addition- 
al functions. Because the product hasn't been released yet, 
many of the specific features and functions are still vague. 

The keystroke memory capability is one of the major new 
features. It makes consolidations easy. A user can execute a 
series of commands with just three keystrokes— /K and any 
one-character abbreviation. In addition, because it displays 
user-specified messages, it can be used for training or demon- 
strations. 

Keystroke memory seems to be the most important new 
feature, and it may even be more powerful than anyone 
realizes. VisiCalc has continued to impress users with its new- 
ly found capabilities. Keystroke memory may just be another 
sleeper that continues to have new uses. 

Another new capability is a command called Attributes. 
This command, envoked from the / menu, provides a wide 
range of different cell attributes. Cell protection, specified data 
type entry, and tabbing are available through the /A com- 
mand. But that is just the beginning. 

Values can be displayed with a floating dollar sign. Values 
can also be displayed with debit (DR), credit (CR), paren- 
thesis for negative values, -I- and - signs, as well as with com- 
mas or with specified decimal places. Information in cells can

all cells can be displayed and printed to assist in template de- 
velopment. The attribute command has other functions as 
well. 

Flexible Financial Functions. Individual column widths 
combined with new print command features, such as print 
margins and lines per page, allow reports to be formatted in a 
more professional manner. There are new financial functions 
like present value, future value, periods, interest rate, pay- 
ment, and internal rate of return. It even has a range of calen- 
dar and time functions. 

In support of all these new features and functions, there is a 
help facility that, at the press of the ? key, will provide exten- 
sive information about the commands available. 

These are not all the new featiares, but it is important not to 
get lost in a function-feature comparison. VisiCalc Advanced 
Version provides almost all of the features that anyone might 
want; however, simple text entry and data sorting are still 
notably absent. Most current users seldom take advantage of 
more than a third of the features anyway. 

VisiCalc Advanced Version provides something more im- 
portant : a tool that can be used by experienced financial and 
mathematical model builders as well as by those with little or 
no experience. For the first time, VisiCalc can be used to de- 
velop applications that are safe from accidental destruction 
and easy to use by beginners. 

This is a well thought-out product that will gain rapid ac- 
ceptance in the corporate world and by other users with so- 
phisticated applications. VisiCalc Advanced Version for the 
Apple in will be available this fall for a suggested retail price 
of $400. And, VisiCalc III is still available for those who don't 
require the additional capabilities. 

VisiSchedule for the Apple III. You might think that Visi- 
Ck)rp would be content with introducing a product like VisiCalc 
Advanced Version for the Apple III. Instead, they have also in- 
troduced a more powerful Apple III version of their Apple II 



product, VisiSchedule. 

VisiSchedule is a powerful tool for those persons who man- 
age scheduling and project cost control. Even though it is an 
extremely useful tool for scheduling complicated projects, 
don't get the idea that the project has to be as complicated as 
the construction of a submarine. Publishers can use Visi- 
Schedule for the development and printing of a book; sales 
managers can use it to forecast the announcement of a new 
merchandising campaign; and it is the perfect tool for project 
managers to determine the schedule for introduction of new 
products. VisiSchedule' s own introduction was planned on Visi- 
Schedule. 

VisiSchedule is designed to be used by project managers to 
track the start and completion dates and specific activity costs 
of complicated projects. The user defines the project activities 
and their interrelationships. For example, if the project is the 
construction of a building, digging the foundation is an activity 
that must be completed before the building framework can be 
constructed. 

Let's Get Critical. The more activities a project has, the 
more difficult it is to accurately schedule the completion date 
of each activity, much less the completion date of the project. In 
project planning, there is a concept called critical path. This is 
that path of activities that requires the longest time to com- 
plete. There usually are many activity paths in a project, but 
usually only one or sometimes two critical paths exist. 

Once the activities and their relationships and the perti- 
nent dates have been entered, VisiSchedule will compute the 
earliest and latest start dates for each activity, and will show 
the critical path and specific costs. In addition, it will print 
summary reports that are useful in controlling costs and re- 
sources, meeting deadlines, and allocating resources. 

Anyone responsible for tracking and administering proj- 
ects will find VisiSchedule a tool designed to serve their needs. 
VisiSchedule for the Apple III is available at a suggested retail 
price of $300.

ELECTRONITURE 



FURNITURE FOR ELECTRONICS 



A PERFECT SYNTHESIS OF CRAFTSMANSHIP, 
HUMAN ENGINEERING, AND AESTHETICS. 




The arts and sciences have finally combin- 
ed to produce a "home" for your computer 
system. The ELECTRONITURE™ com- 
puter desk — and matching printer stand — 
are made of solid oak (a welcome choice in 
this age of metal shelving and particle 
board carpentry). Attention to detail is ob- 
vious in the gently rounded edges, the 
precision hardware, the convenient 
hideaway work surface that glides out 
above the keyboard, the invisible West 
German couplings that give the assembled 
unit rock-solid stability, and the satin 
smooth hand rubbed oil finish. 

The best of two disciplines 

The design of the desk is a triumph of both 
form and function. As furniture, it is a 
handsome addition to home or of- 
fice—with classic lines that complement 
any room, any decor. As a functional com- 
puter work area, it brings order and effi- 
ciency to the system, comfort and con- 
venience to the user. 

Because the desk strictly adheres to the 
principles of Humanscale™ (the most 
sophisticated and thoroughly documented 
design parameters available for meeting 



the physical needs and 
capacities of human 
beings), you will find that 
your keyboard, monitor, 
and disk drives are always 
at the most comfortable 
operating distance and 
within the same focal 
range. Everything falls 
"naturally to hand"— 
thanks to science, not trial 
and error. 

Overall dimensions are 
suprisingly modest: 50" 
high, 44" wide, 29V2" deep 
printer stand is ISVi" high, 
24" wide, 19" deep). Yet 
because the ELECTRONI- 
TURE™ desk is designed 
from the ground up for 
technological applications, it easily ac- 
comodates modular type computers such 
as Apple II or III, IBM P/C, Atari 400 or 
800, and their peripherals. The monitor 
cabinet handles monitors up to ISVi" high, 
30" wide, 16" deep. Disk drives and soft- 
ware can be placed in the cabinet beside the 
monitor. Most 80-column dot matrix 
printers can fit next to the computer, while 
larger printers can be accomodated on the 
printer stand. 

Hie optics, alone, make the desk well 
worth the investment. 

The oak door in front of the monitor is in- 
set with non-glare glass originally 
developed for NASA. This glass has anti- 
reflectant coatings and a neutral density 
filter. The anti-reflective coatings minimize 
the eye fatigue associated with trying to 
focus on your monitor's display through 
ambient reflections. The neutral density 



filter maximizes character definition and 
enhances color displays — without distort- 
ing the image or the colors. The coatings 
are unaffected by temperature or humidity 
and are virtually abrasion proof. 

$895. Satisfaction guaranteed. 

We're so certain that you'll be pleased with 
your ELECTRONITURE™ that we'll glad- 
ly refund the entire purchase price if you're 
dissatisfied for any reason. And if you have 
any questions not answered in this adver- 
tisement, please phone us any weekday bet- 
ween 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. FT, at 
707-526-1074 

The computer desk is $895, the printer 
stand is $225, and we have an optional 
paper bale for the stand at $25. California 
residents please add 6% sales tax. All 
prices include shipping in the continental 
U.S. The desk is shipped unassembled — 
assembly takes about 20 minutes — and the 
only tool needed is a screwdriver. 

Why not place your order today. Even the 
most powerful computer system can be 
vastly improved by the logical organization 
and operating comfort of ELECTRONI- 
T U R E ™ .

You haveni lived until youve died in space. 

And here's your chance. 
Software author Peter Fokos has created Alien 
Annbush, a space age nightmare. This hi-res, full-color 
arcade game is written completely in assembly 
language to give those nasty aliens every advantage. 

So if you have access to a 48K Apple* with DOS 
3.3, and you're hot for some new thrills, Alien Ambush 
was written for you. But be warned: It just got a lot 
tougher to survive in space.

Hold on there, podniih! Don't bet your bottom dollar the

For those of you who believe that lightning never strikes

contemplating 

a byte 

Robots are here and they are changing the world we live In. From bulky Industrial 
welders to fantastically complex planetary probes, robots are sure to make our lives a Uttle 
easier. Robots will get much more sophisticated In the decades to come ; by the next cen- 
tury they may be our model citizens. 

But will robots be immune from the human weaknesses that usually attend a high level 
of intelligence? On the cover of our August 1981 Issue we fantasized what a humanold robot 
may look like in the future. We also gave this highly developed mechanical man the hard- 
est task we could devise — contemplating an object and its significance. 

Will robots ever be able to sit and think about something that is not directly related to 
performing a task? 

Softalk can't answer that question for you, but we can help you contemplate the un- 
known future In a special way. We commissioned graphics artist Robert Zralck to do 
August's cover with a poster in mind. The robot contemplating a bite is evocative both of 
Rodin's The Thinker and the Genesis passage on the Garden of Eden . . . not to mention the 
possible significance to our favorite technological fruit. 

The artist and Softalk are sharing in the profits from the poster. Softalk will distribute 
its proceeds to individuals developing Apple tools to help the handicapped. Softalk guaran- 
tees 100 percent distribution of Its monies. 

In addition to the posters, which are sold at $6.00 (plus fl.SO to cover shipping and han- 
dling) , some of the two hundred artist's proofs, signed by Rot>ert Zralck, are still available 
at $79 each. 

The size of the poster is 24 inches by 34 Inches. The artist's proofs arc hand-numbered and 
hand-signed, and each Is accompanied by a certificate giving its number and guarantee- 
ing that only 200 are being distributed. 

Robert Zraick's art will grace any computer room, and your purchase will help others 
become more self-sufficient.

forth from their Eugene, Oregon, apartment to do economic 
battle with the big guys. They won. Apple Oalaxian, now called 
Alien Rain, dominated the Christmas 1980 season like the 
Colossus dominated Rhodes. It sold more copies faster than 
any program that preceded it and probably marks the water- 
shed between the old cottage industry market and today's 
high-gloss, volume-oriented market. 

Galaxian was followed by Space Eggs, which was followed 
by Raster Blaster. For long months, VisiCalc quietly bided its 
time, waiting for the game craze to end and for the Apple mar-

sallied forth from their new corporate fort in San Rafael, Cali- 
fornia, to again test the market. First returns were disquiet- 
ing — only eleventh the first month. What was not known was 
that much of the nation did not receive the program in time to 
do much, if any, selling during May. But in June Chopl\fter 
took off. 

There's a caveat necessary to insert here. Choplifter clear- 
ly outsold Apple II VisiCalc. But the combined sales of both Ap- 
ple n and Apple HI VisiCalc easily outstripped the game to 
maintain VisiCorp's prestige as leading software publisher. 

What of past pretenders to the throne? They didn't do so 
badly either. On-Line Systems dressed Superscribe in new 
garb, changed the name to Screen Writer II, and made a deter- 
mined run itself, ending up third in its first month of reissue.

but dropped to fourtii, still showing enough strength to carry 
big brother Wizardry to fifth. 

Home Accountant grabbed sixth. Personal Filing System 
was seventh, Snack Attack was eighth, and DB Master was 
ninth. If you're beginning to get the idea that the May disarray 
was superseded by the June bloom, you're catching on fast. 

In fact, if Apple Galaxian signalled the end of the age of in- 
nocence in software marketing and buying, perhaps this June 
represents the next major turning point. 

First, Apple mounted a counterattacli to ward off marliet 
inertia and various other competitors. They bundled Apple 
Writer II with the system at a special price. Now Apple Writer 
II, created by Paul Lutus, Is a pretty fair country word proces- 
sor itself. And between systems sales and normal sales, Apple 
Writer II was right up there with Choplifter and VisiCalc in 
terms of how many end users acquired the package. But after 
subtracting out bundled sales, the program ended up fifteenth. 

If Choplifter made June the month of the joystick. Screen 
Writer and Apple Writer made it the month of the word 
processor. 

Second, dealers witnessed prosperity even in the face of a 
stagnant economy. Bruce Burdlck of Computerland of Over- 
land Park is in his third year. His sales in June exceeded by six 
figures what he had once targeted to be ills annual sales in his 
fifth year. The first million-dollar month by a single retail com- 
puter location is just around the comer. 

Third, Micro Lab quietly began a program that may revo- 
lutionize the way software is made available to the public. 



AUGUST 1982 



193 



Under the aegis of Stan Goldberg, the company has hired a net- 
work of sales reps and has commenced a stocking program, 
whereby the dealer has no front money tied up in Micro Lab 
product and at the end of each thirty-day period, he pays only 
for that product that he's sold. 

The advantages to the dealer are immediate and obvious. 
He can get a large stock of software without the flooring costs 
usually attendant to such inventory. Hopefully, this will mean 
wider selection for the end user at the retail store. The advan- 
tage for Micro Lab is obtaining prime display space for its 
wide range of products in more stores than their prior distrib- 
utors could deliver. The gamble for Micro Lab is whether these 
newly reached end users will be attracted to their product line. 

As with all things temporal, the reaction from the retail sec- 
tor is not unanimous. But, for the most part, Goldberg is seen 
as a welcome stand-in for the Second Coming. Paul Page of 
Computers Unlimited in Towson, Maryland, made no bones 
about his approbation: "I think It's a great idea and more pub-

Ushers should do it. It creates a nice display in the store and in- 
creases the manufacturer's exposure." Luke Snyder of Pams- 
worth Computers in Chicago ventured that "this is the way 
software should be handled." In his view, the major publish- 
ers should go with stocking plans, while the smaller publishers 
should stop trying to market direct and enlist the aid of the dis- 
tributors. 

It will be some months before the plan is completely imple- 
mented. But it's a safe bet that if Goldberg should soon take a 
walk across Lake Michigan, and it's July instead of Decem- 
ber, it would portend momentous changes to come in software 
marketing. 

A fourth change in the marketplace is the unexpected 
strength of several unprotected pieces of software in the Hobby 
Ten list. For the second consecutive month, seven of the ten en- 
tries are not copy-protected.

1st CLASS MAIL. By Bob Schoenburg and Steve Pollack. 
Here's a pair of authors who may be software's answer 
to Irving Wallace. Wallace is the bestselling author who 
hears the murmuring of general populace and caters to 
their desires. Bob Schoenburg and Steve Pollack seem 
to have the same trait. 
Consider. 

The pair brought out Home Money Minder, a 
perfectly respectable home finance package. Then they 
listened to the user feedback. The result was Home 
Accountant, one of the phenomenal success stories of the 
first half of 1982. 

Around the same time Home Money Minder hit, the 
team also tested the market with The Mailroom. 
Mailroom never was the success of HMM, but the authors 
used the same technique — listen to the users and in- 
corporate all the good ideas. The result is 1st CLASS 
MAIL — a program that, incredibly enough, manages to 
live up to its double-entendre name. 

All of the above is not to accuse Schoenburg and 
Pollack of putting out the programming equivalent of 
stalking-horses to do their market research for them. 
Their original efforts do stand on their own merit. They 
just pale next to the sequels. 

1st CLASS MAIL is so well thought out and so easy 
to use that other publishers who call their programs ' 'user 
friendly" should bow their heads in shame, 

SOFTALK got an early release of the program sans 
documentation. Yet a rank computer illiterate was able 
to apply the program to two separate uses with relatively 
little trouble. This is high praise indeed; that a novice 
operator could use a powerful program with no more 
than the screen menus. 

The program allows for twelve fields, clearly more 
than the traditional name and address of a mailing label. 
The implication is that the software can be put to other 
innovative uses as well. The built-in ability to sort and 
filter on any field or combination thereof enhances the 
chances that users will find multiple applications for 
the program. 

Continental Software will actually be publishing 
four versions of the program.'* The one already in release 
is for the Apple II using floppy disks. A hard-disk ver- 
sion will follow. Both versions are pending for Apple III 
as well, awaiting the development of a rapid binary sort 
subroutine. 

Ist CLASS MAIL is a first-rate program for special- 
ized data base applications.

ANNOUNCING 
AN INNOVATION 
IN TYPING INSTRUCTION. 



AUGUST 1982 



In good times, their continued success would not be so re- 
markable, but May was the absolute pits. Any reasonable per- 
son would have thought that in times of tight money, the un- 
protected software would be ripped off while the preciovis dol- 
lars went to the otherwise unobtainable protected disks. In- 
stead, Penguin and Beagle Bros, champions of the open soft- 
ware policy, are reaping the rewards while others moan the 
vicissitudes of the economy. 

Three programs made the Top Thirty for the first time in 
June: Apple Speller from Sensible Software, Marauder from 
On-Line Systems, and Bandits from Sirius Software. 

There were few shifts in the Apple III market, where Visir 
Calc, Apple Writer III, and Personal Filing System hold forth 
as the leaders. The Executive Accounting System (EASy) 
from Denver Software displaced Oreat Plains as the account- 
ing package of preference. 

The remarkable sales levels of unprotected programs in the 
Hobby Ten was enumerated previously. Equally noteworthy 
was the widened gap between leader Bag of Tricks from Qual-

ity Software and the second-place program. In addition to 
tightening its hold at the top of the Hobby Ten list, Bag of 
Tricks rose to tenth on the Top Thirty. 

The top seven programs in the Home Ten list have been 
there so long they almost have permanent possession of their 
positions. But the bottom three programs are new and, in one 
case, quixotic. Logo, an educational programming lang^uage, 
made eighth in the form sold by Apple Computer. The Dow 
Jones Market Analyser from RTR Software took ninth, and 
Micro-Courier, clearly out of its class, got tenth. 

Everyone knows Micro-Courier is a business communica- 
tions package. So why's it Usted in the home section? Because 
that's where the other communications packages are listed, in 
deference to their wide use for purposes other than business. 
Micro-Courier has no diversity of uses; it's a business pack- 
age pvire and simple. But it's also a communications package, 
so it's hsted here with its compatriots, even if it isn't right. 

Micro-Courier would not have made the Business Ten, 
where changes are rare. The top eight programs held their 
ground in June, with PFS: Graph and dBase II taking over 
ninth and tenth from General Manager and Versaform. Re- 
tailers were voluble in their praise of PFS: Graph and the way 
in which it interfaces with the dandy new Hewlett-Packard 
plotter. 

As noted before, word processors found their way Into the 
hands of end users in unprecedented quantities in Jtine. In ad- 
dition to Screen Writer and Apple Writer, WordStar's sales re- 
boimded nicely from a May slump. Apple Speller from Sen- 
sible Software glommed on to more than three-quarters of the 
market for proofreading programs and attained the Top 
Thirty. 




Improve your keyboard skills 

witn Masterlype. 

A typing program for the Apple II that 
dares to be fun. But it's not just child's play. 
No matter who you are, your computer will 
become a more efficient tool, as you become 
a more proficient typist. And MasterType 
can help. Dramatically. 

But don't just take our word for it. 

Infoworld magazine had this to say 
about Lightning Software's Hi-Res MasterType: 
"MasterType is an excellent instructional 
typing game. We had fun reviewing it, and 
we highly recommend it to those who 
want to learn typing in an unconventional 
but motivating way." 

Infoworld also went on to rate Master- 
Type as Excellent in all categories. 

Good news for Atari owners! 

MasterType will introduce an Atari version 
on July 1st. Watch for it! 

Attention all Dealers.

AUGUST 1982 



And coming up fast Is PIE Writer from Hayden. When PIE 
Writer was Apple PIE from Programma, it dominated south- 
em California word processing completely. It was nearly im- 
possible to buy another program. Now it's back in improved 
form and with a more formidable marketing arm, spoiling for 
the fray and showing in the early rounds that it intends to in- 
crease its market share. 

Also new to the Word Processor Ten is Zardax, the brash 
Aussie contender. 

Castle Wolfenstein remains firmly atop the Strategy Five 
list as well as being sixteenth on the Top Thirty. Another Silas 
Warner creation, RobotWar, rejoins the list as the only new- 
comer this month. 

Infocom's amazing Deadline continues to best its hi-res 
cousins in the adventure genre as well as missing the Top 
Thirty by only one place. The some maligned Kabul Spy rose to 



Apple-franchlsed retail stores representing approximately 9.3 percent of 
the sales of Apples and Apple-related products volunteered to participate In 
the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early In July to ascertain their sales leaders 
for the month of June. 

The only criterion for Inclusion on the list was number of sales made — 
such other criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer retail- 
er, and personal preference of the Individual respondents were not con- 
sidered. 

Respondents in July represented every geographical area of the conti- 
nental United States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted In 
the Index number to the left of the program name In the Top Thirty listing. 
The Index number is an arbitrary measure of relative strength of the pro- 
grams listed. Index numbers are correlative only for the month in which they 
are printed: readers cannot assume that an Index rating of 60 in one month 
represents equivalent sales to an index number of 60 in another month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus-or- minus 3.8 percent, which trans- 
lates roughly into the theoretical possibility of a change of 2.63 points, plus or 
minus, in any index number.

second while Time Zone dropped to third. The Wizard and the 
Princess bounced back to fourth and Zork II was fifth. 

Slr-tech's domination of the Fantasy Five continues. Con- 
sider that Knight of Diamonds and Wizardry sold more copies 
In June than all other eligible programs combined. Andrew 
Greenberg and Robert Woodhead are the first writing team to 
have two programs in the top five of the Top Thirty for two con- 
secutive months, besting Ken and Roberta Williams. When the 
Slr-techers wrap up their next volume, they can take a shot at 
another set of the On-Liners's laurels as the only team ever to 
put three programs in the top ten. 

But for all of the genius of Greenberg and Woodhead and of 
Williams and Williams, and for all of the Impending shifts in 
the marketplace, one thing seems sure: soon we'll see Visi- 
Calc back leading the Apple market. But uneasy should be the 
head that wears the crown. You see . . . there's still a number 
of heretofore unknown programmers rendering programs. 
And there's still another Carlston to be drafted into the fray. 

So if VisiCalc gets too dominant, around Christmas 1983 we 
should see Doug, Gary, Kathy and brother Don salljdng forth 
from the Broderbund bauhaus with yet another unknown's 
first product to prove that fairy tales can come true.
