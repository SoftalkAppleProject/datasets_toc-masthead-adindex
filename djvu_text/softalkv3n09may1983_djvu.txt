May. 

There's the month of May, May Flowers, 
May Day, "Mother, May I?" May pull syrup, 
Maymie Eisenhower, the Mayflower, May din 
Japan, and Maypole. Maypole? That's a good 
one; it's contest time. 

You don't see a whole lot of Maypoles 
around anymore. But they were fun while they 
lasted. People used to dance around them while 
holding on to brightly colored streamers. Now, 
in case you're picturing a bunch of party ani- 
mals getting drunk and doing disco steps 
around a pole, it wasn't quite like that. 

Here's how it worked. There was this great 
big pole with streamers attached to the top. 
Kids would form a circle around the pole, each 
one holding on to a streamer. Numbered from 
one to however many kids there were, the odd- 
numbered ones would start walking in one di- 
rection around the pole, and the rest would 
walk in the opposite direction. 

At first, they all bumped into each other af- 
ter taking two steps. Then they got the great 
idea of weaving over and under each other's 
streamers. This had two nifty effects. One, the 
kids didn't bump into each other anymore; and 
two, the pole ended up elaborately decorated 
with braided colored streamers. 

Well, this month we're going to make our 
own Maypoles, only we're going to use word 
chains as streamers. A word chain is a sequence 
of words, names, or phrases that link from one 
to the next by words in common, words that 
sound alike, puns, or special relationships. An 
example: baseball . . . Yankees . . . keystone . . . 
cops . . . Copts and Robbers . . . Sirius Soft- 
ware . . . dogstar . . . and so on. Simple. 

Our Maypole has six streamers, which means 
you'll have to make six word chains. And 
just to create a little brain twisting, we'll add 
one small catch. Each time streamers (chains) 
"cross," the links in each chain must also link to 
the streamer it's crossing. For instance, if our 
chain given in the previous example were to 
cross another chain at the link, "dogstar," then 
the other chain's link must link to "dogstar." 

Sure it sounds confusing; and it's even more 
tricky than it sounds. But just to show that 
nothing is impossible, we've included an exam- 
ple of a Maypole on the next page. 

Send in your entry in matrix form, just like 
the example on the next page. Each box con- 
tains two links. The top link in each box moves 



MAY 1983 




from left to right, and the bottom one moves 
from right to left. In our example, "baseball dia- 
mond" in box A (top) moves to box B and 
changes to "Diamonds Are Forever," while 
"Sir-tech" in box C (bottom) goes left to box B 
and changes to "Knight of Diamonds." 

Start your first turn by filling in boxes A, C, 
and E. On the next turn, the top links will move 
from A to B, from C to D, and from E to F. 
The bottom links, on the other hand, will move 
from A to F, from C to B, and from E to D 
(whew!). 

In other words, for each turn, each link 
moves to the box on its left; each bottom one 
moves to the box on its right. And don't over- 
look wraparound. When a top link gets to box 
F, it moves next to box A; when a bottom link 
gets to box A, it next moves to box F. It's easier 
if you just picture the top row as words on a 
conveyor belt going one way, and the bottom 
row as words on a belt going the other way. 
Each time the rows line up, the words have to 
change, yet still relate to each other. 

In our example, each chain has a different 
color to make the chain easier to follow. We've 
even left the fifth turn empty for you to try your 
hand at Maypole building. 

Scoring. Give yourself ten points for each 
link of each chain. You also get twenty bonus 
(extra) points for each link that represents an 
Apple-related company or product. In other 
words, Apple-related links are worth thirty 
points. 

The person with the highest score will reign 
as the Softalk Maypole Dance Champ and will 
receive $100 in all sorts of wonderful stuff made 
by our advertisers. Send in your entry matrix 
with your name, address, phone number, and 
what you'd hke to win to Softalk Maypole, Box 
60, North Hollywood, CA 91603, postmarked 
by June 10, 1983.

Oracle Final Four's Final Two. In the 

world of college sports, most fans will remem- 
ber 1983 as the Year of the Ulcer. Basketball 
tough kid Ralph Sampson went home for the 
fourth time without a championship ring, the 
NCAA swimming and diving championships 
were decided in the last .48 seconds of the last 
event, and Georgia football hero Herschel 
Walker turned professional prematurely — in 
that other league. 

Entrants in Softalk's Oracle '83 contest, 
however, will remember it as the year every- 
thing went wrong in the NCAA basketball tour- 
nament. That's a bit misleading, though, be- 
cause it was a great tournament for the un- 
derdog. 

Unfortunately, when it came to predicting 
which teams would make the NCAA's Final 
Four, most contestants took a look at the na- 
tional rankings as they were at the time (De- 
cember 1982) and made their selections based 
on that. If Oracle contestants had their way, it 
would have been Virginia, UCLA, Indiana, and 
Georgetown. After all, those were the teams 
that were heading the wire services' and coach- 
es' polls back in December, and they were the 




teams that most people picked to be on the road 
to Albuquerque. Most, but not all. 

One of those "not alls" was Paul Ducken- 
field (Clemson, SC), the winner of Oracle '83, 
part 2. Of the hundreds and hundreds of en- 
tries, most couldn't name even one team; some 
were able to come up with one. The most teams 
anyone could name was two, and Duckenfield 
was one of only three persons to do so. The 
awesome Softalk Random Number Generator 
came back from vacation just in time to pick 
Duckenfield as the winner. 

Duckenfield predicted Virginia (nope), 
Georgetown (still nope), Louisville (yep), and 
Houston (yep again) to make the trip to Albu- 
querque. Even though he was able to predict 
only half the teams, it was good enough to win 
him the customary $100 in prizes for his Apple. 
When we called to let him know he had won, 
Duckenfield was too overcome with joy to de- 
cide what he wanted to get. Probably some 
games? A joystick? How about some utilities? 
"Um, um, um, I dunno." 

For those who got disgusted and quit fol- 
lowing the tournament when their predicted 
teams were eliminated. North Carolina State

AMPERGRAPH is a powerful, easy-to-use 
relocatable graphics utility for the Apple II +le. 
AMPERGRAPH adds twenty-two Applesoft com- 
mands that allow effortless generation of profes- 
sional-looking plots of scientific or financial data. All 
of the necessary scaling and screen formatting is ac- 
complished with just a few, simple Applesoft lines. 

Unlike most other plotting systems for the Apple II 
which are stand-alone systems, the AMPERGRAPH 
utility provides extended BASIC graphics language 
macros that you can use directly in your own Ap- 
plesoft programs. The additional commands are 
&SCALE, &LIMIT, &AXES, &GRID, &FRAME, &LOG 
X, &LOG Y, &LABEL AXES, &LABEL, &VLABEL, 
&CENTER LABEL, &CENTER VLABEL, &DRAW, 
&PENUP, &GROSS, &OPEN SQUARE, &CLOSED 
SQUARE, &OPEN CIRCLE, &CLOSED CIRCLE, 
&ERROR BARS, &DUMP (to dump the graph on a 
Silentype printer) and &*DUMP (to link with AMER- 
DUMP, see below). ^ „

inches) 

* Vertical magnifications: 9 with Epson printers 
(0.88 to 7.96 inches); 6 with all others (1.33 to 8.00 
inches) 

* Horizontal and vertical magnifications can be 
specified independently. 

' Normal / Inverse dumps * Fast 

* Adjustable horizontal tab * Easy to use 

* Compatible with AMPERGRAPH * Relocatable

squeaked by Virginia, and Georgia beat the tar 
out of the North Carolina Tar Heels to make 
the trip to the Final Four as well. 

The Peru Brothers, Shawn McLaughlin 
(Peru, NY) and Larry Houston (Peru, IN), were 
the only others who could name two teams. 
McLaughlin picked Houston (the school, not 
Larry) and Louisville, while Houston (Larry, 
not the school) tagged Louisville and North 
Carolina State to make the final cut. 

A special mention goes to James M. Wil- 
son III (Skaneateles, NY), who was the only 
one to predict that Georgia would be one of the 
last four teams left. That's not a bad feat, con- 
sidering that this was the first time in the 
school's seventy-eight-year basketball history 
that it's ever been invited to take part in the 
tournament. And who would have guessed at 
the beginning of the season that Georgia would 
even be invited? Only Wilson. 

As for those ten bonus points for predicting 
the winner . . . sorry, gang. You could count on 
one hand the number of people who predicted 
Houston and North Carolina State to make the 
Final Four, but not one person predicted that 
North Carolina State would pull a slam dunk 
out of nowhere with one second left to win the 
national championship. 

Before we get rolling with the results of Feb- 
ruary's contest, a special thanks goes out to 
Marlene Sutton (Watertown, SD), who sent the 
most thoughtful get-well card to our injured 
mail carriers. The mail carriers thank you, the 
guard dog thanks you, and we thank you. 

Now, the Juicy News. For a lot of contest- 
ants in our Funky February Puns 'n' Ana- 
grams contest, February came to an end none 
too soon. The contest was mean; the clues kill- 
ers. One man who didn't think it was too bad is 
Lauren Flewelling (Boxboro, MA), who won 
the first part of the contest, solving the puns- 
and-anagrams clues to complete the crossword 
puzzle. 

Flewelling, an avid reader of Games maga- 
zine, spent just a few days deciphering, demys- 
tifying, and depunning all the clues to the cross- 
word monstrosity. His $100 certificate will go 
toward the purchase of Sensible Software's Sen- 
sible Speller, which he'll pick up at his local 
store, the Game Shop, in nearby Acton. 

When putting together clues for the con- 
test, Softalk's contest conjurers laughed with dia- 
bolical glee; they thought no one would even 
come close to solving them all. By the time the 
last entry was wrenched from a bruised and tat- 
tered mail carrier's hand, the contest conjurers 
weren't laughing very loud. Quite a number of 
contestants managed to get all but one, and a 
relative handful turned in a perfect score. 

Rest assured, all you who tore your hair out 
and kicked the dog because you thought some 
clues had no answer; the answers to the cross- 
word appear at the end of this section. 

The second part of the contest, figuring out 
what each answer had to do with the month of 
February, involved much more than an agile 
mind; it required a good pair of feet to walk 
down to the library and a good set of eyes to 
look up all those names, events, and dates. 



Even though contestants' success with part 1 
put a damper on things at the contestmeisters' 
Valentine's Day party, part 2 managed to arch a 
few supercilious eyebrows. Nobody got all the 
dates right. 

But that's okay; there were enough obscure 
names and dates to drive even the best re- 
searchers batty. Leading the way in looking-up- 
stuff skills was Bruce Buzbee (San Jose, CA), 
who got every name, event, and date right ex- 
cept for four of them. Selecting prizes present- 
ed somewhat of a problem for Buzbee. "If I win 
the crossword puzzle part," he wrote on his en- 
try, "I'd like to get The Arcade Machine from 
Broderbund and BudgeCo's Pintail Construc- 
tion Set (that should keep me busy for a while)." 

However, he also wrote, "If I win the date- 
finding part, I promised my wife she could have 
whatever she wants. She would like to get 
Sirius's Type Attack and Synergistic's Microbe. 
If I win both parts, I'd like to get all of the 
above and retire as the undefeated Softalk 
Crossword Solver Supreme." 

Well, since Buzbee did win the second part, 
is he going to go away empty-handed and let his 
wife have what she wants? "No way. We're go- 
ing to split the prizes." 

Now, the Dirt. Three entries that caught 
our eye were those by Alice Asling (Davis, CA), 
Jason Kantor (Palo Alto, CA), and Dick Tim- 
berlake (Colorado Springs, CO), who solved 
clue twelve across to be "Pia [Zadora]." We're 
still scratching our heads trying to figure out 
how they arrived at that answer. 

The name of the game for the Jeffries (Den- 
ver, CO) household was team effort. Accompa- 
nying entries by Ruth, Tony, and William Jef- 
fries was a cover letter that said, "Enclosed are 
three identical entries because this has been a 
family venture. No, we didn't put in an entry for 
every member of the tribe. Steve said it was 
sheer madness, Patty kept the fiends in food, 
Kenney took phone calls, and Nancy let the dog 
out." 

We think people like Russell Negus (Mans- 
field, MA) are just swell. Negus wasn't picky 
about what he wanted for prizes if he won. If you 
use a little recollection, you'll remember that the 
coupon asked contestants to fill in their choices 
of preferred prizes after the prompt, "Gee, I'd 
like to win; ." But Negus didn't care what he 
won; he changed his entry blank to read, "Gee, 
I'd like to win!!!" Sorry, Russell. You did- 
n't win. 

In addition to being one of the three who 
figured Pia Zadora to be "a most beautiful 
woman," Jason Kantor is also this month's Sof- 
talk Slob. Kantor's entry arrived complete with 
smeared ink, frayed edges, grease stains, and 
marks that looked like the remains of some sort 
of brown fluid. His penmanship was nice, 
though. 

Here are the answers to the February Puns 
'n' Anagrams contest:

YOU WIU NEVER JMrAIN 
HAVE TO WASTE HME 
WAITING FOR YOUR PRINTER. 



MICROBUFFER Allows YOU 
TO PRINT AND PROCESS 
SIMULTANEOUSLY. 

Microbuffer will instantly increase 
your efficiency — and eliminate 
the frustration of waiting for your 
slowpoke printer. 

Now you can simply dump your 
printing data directly to Microbuffer 
and continue processing. 
Microbuffer accepts the data as 
fast as your computer can send. It 
stores the data in its own memory 
buffer, then takes control of your 
printer. 

THERE IS A MICROBUFFER 
FOR ANY COMPUTER/PRINTER 
COMBINATION. 



Whatever your system, there is a 
specific Microbuffer designed to 
accommodate it. 




FOR APPLE II COMPUTERS, 
Mircobuffer II features on-board 
firmware for text formatting and 
advanced graphics dump routines. 
Both serial and pari lei versions 



have a power-efficient low- 
consumption design. Special 
functions include Basic listing 
formatter, self-test, buffer zap, and 
transparent and maintain modes. 
The 16K model is priced at $259 
and the 32K, at $299. 




FOR EPSON PRINTERS, Microbuffer/ E 
comes in two serial versions — 
8K or 16K (upgradable to 32K) — 
and two parallel versions — 16K 
or 32K (upgradable to 64K). The 
serial buffer supports both hard- 
ware handshaking and XON-XOFF 
software handshaking at baud 
rates up to 19,200. Both interfaces 
are compatible with standard Epson 
commands, including GRAFTRAX-80 
and GRAFTRAX-80 +. Prices range 
from $159 to $279. 




ALL OTHER COMPUTER/PRINTER 
COMBINATIONS are served by the 
stand-alone Microbuffer In-line. 

The serial stand-alone will 
support different input and output 
baud rates and different hand- 
shake protocol. Both serial and 
parallel versions are available in a 
32K model at $299 or 64K for 
$349. Either can be user-upgraded 
to a total of 256K with 64K add-ons 
— just $179 each. 

SIMPLE TO INSTALL. 

Microbuffer II is slot-independent. 
It slips directly inside the Apple II 
in any slot except zero. 

Microbuffer/ E mounts easily 
inside the existing auxiliary slot 
directly inside the Epson printer. 

The stand-alone Microbuffer is 
installed in-line between virtually 
any computer and any printer. 

MICROBUFFER FROM 
PRACTICAL PERIPHERALS. 

So what are you waiting for? Write 
to us for more information or ask 
your dealer for a demonstration. 

When you see how much 
freedom Microbuffer will allow, 
you'll understand why it's so silly 
to be without one.

Thisyear.thousandsof Kids will be 
searching for the most amazing thing 

At Spinnaker, we don't believe in the 
"kill or be killed" concept behind nnost 
computer games. In fact, we believe 
computer games should be instruc- 
tive, hot destructive. Butjustas 
importantly, they should be fun. 

That's why in 5EARCM OF TfiE MOST 
AMAZIMQ TfiiriCj™i5 designed to let your 
kids negotiate with aliens instead of destroy- 
ing them. Because given the opportunity 
^ kids enjoy using their minds. 
It's Amazingly Fun. 

The Most Amazing Thing is out there 
somewhere. Finding it won't be easy 
But relax, your kids will have the 
help of their old uncle 5moke Bailey 
he'll give them a B-liner (sort of a 
cross between a hot air balloon 
and a dune buggy) to use on their 
Journey They'll have to learn how to 
fly the B-liner and navigate it through 
storms and fog. But before they do 
anything, your kids will have to talk to Old 
5moke. he'll tell them about the Mire People 
and the strange language that they speak, he'll 
also tell them to avoid the dangerous Mire 
Crabs and how to get fuel for the B-liner 

Your kids will visit the Metallican Auction 
where they'll trade with the aliens for valuable 
chips. Your kids will then use these chips to buy 
things they'll need for their trip. And your kids 
will learn how to fly over the planet using their 
jet pack. 

The Most Amazing Thing 
holds great powers, but it will 
take great skill, persistence 
and imagination to find it. 
It's Amazingly Educational. 

lh5EARChOFThEM05T 
AMAZinQ ThlhQ is written by 
Tom Snyder, educator and 
author of the best-selling 
Snooper Troops™ Detective 
Series. 

And like all Spinnaker games, Ih 
SEARCh OF ThE MOST AMAZING ThIhQ has rea 
educational value. For instance, your kids will 
sharpen their ability to estimate distances and 




quantities. And since they'll be navi- 
gating their B-liner, they'll become aware 
of distance, direction and time. They'll also 
develop a knack for economic and monetary 
principles through trading with the aliens. 
And they'll solve problems through trial 
and error 

They'll learn all of these things, plus they'll 
learn that nothing is impossible if you put your 
mind to it. 

A Movel Approach to Computer C5ames. 

Besides offering your children all of the above, 
in SEARCh OF ThE MOST AMAZihQ ThIhQ gives 
them an opportunity to develop their reading 
skills. Because included with the game is Jim 
Morrow's new novel The Adventures of Smoke 
Baile y* So your children will have hours of fun 
reading the book or playing the game. And 
they'll be learning at the same time. 
Parental Discretion Advised. 

If you're a parent who would rather see your 
kids reason with aliens than destroy them, 
you've got plenty of reasons to 
ask your local software retailer 
for IM SEARCh OF ThE MOST 
AMAZIMQ ThIhG. It's compatible 
with Apple,® IBM,® Atari,® and 
Commodore 64™ computers. 
And it offers so much fun you'll 
probably be tempted to play it yo

system that lets you create lessons 
on any subject, tailoring the 
progrcim to your child's needs. No 
knowledge of computers is required. 
Our programs make sense to people 
— from 4 to 94 — and grow right 
along with your child.

chosen CAI progrcims to teach 
essenticd vocabulary and logic skills 
in a full range of topics. Our products 
get recognition— because they work.

RAPHKS WHERE 




TSHMIJ 

You'll never see Infocom s graphics on 
any computer screen. Because there's 
never been a computer built by man 
that could handle the images we pro- 
duce. And, there never will be. 
We draw our graphics from the limit- 
less imagery of your imagination— a 
technology so powerful, it makes 
any picture that's ever come 
out of a screen look like 
graffiti by comparison. 
And nobody knows how 
to unleash your imag- 
ination like Infocom. 
Through our prose, 
your imagination 
makes you part of 
our stories, in con- 
trol of what you do 
and where you go- 
yet unable to pre- 
dict or control the 
course of events. 
You're confronted 
with situations and 
logical puzzles the like 
of which you won't find 
elsewhere. And you're im- 
mersed in rich environments alive 
with personalities as real as any 
you'll meet in the flesh— yet all the 
more vivid because they're perceived 
directly by your mind's eye, not 
through your external senses. The 
method to this magic? We've found 
the way to plug our prose right into 
your psyche, and catapult you into a 
whole new dimension. 

Take some tough critics' words 
about our words. SOFTALK, for 
example, called ZORK® Ill's prose 




'far more graphic than any depiction 
yet achieved by an adventure with 
graphics." And the NEW YORK 
TIMES saw fit to print that our 
DEADLINE™ is "an amazing 
feat of programming." Even a 
journal as video-oriented as ELEC- 
TRONIC GAMES found Infocom 
prose to be such an eye-opener they 
named one of our games their Best 
Adventure of 1983. 

Better still, bring an Infocom game 
home with you. Discover firsthand 
why thousands upon thousands of 
discriminating game players keep 
turning everything we write into 
instantaneous bestsellers. 

Step up to Infocom. All words. No 
graffiti. The secret reaches of your 
mind are beckoning. A whole new 
dimension is in there waiting for you.

For Line Surge Suppression 

The SYSTEM SAVER provides es- 
sential protection to hardware and 
data from dangerous power surges 
and spikes. 




Volts 
RMS 



SYSTEM SAVER 
APPLE II 



By connecting the Apple II 
power input through the SYSTEM 
SAVER, power is controlled in two 
ways: 1) Dangerous voltage spikes 
are clipped off at a safe 130 Volts 
RMS/175 Volts dc level. 2) High fre- 
quency noise is smoothed out be- 
fore reaching the Apple E. A PI type 
filter attenuates common mode 
noise signals by a minimum of 
30 dB from 600 khz to 20 mhz, with 
a maximum attenuation of 50 dB. 



For Cooling 

As soon as you add 80 columns or 
more memory to your Apple II you 
need SYSTEM SAVER. 

Today's advanced peripheral 
cards generate more heat. In addi- 
tion, the cards block any natural air 
flow through the Apple n creatmg 
high temperature conditions that 
substantially reduce the life of the 
cards and the computer itself. 



For Operating Efficiency 

SYSTEM SAVER contains two 
switched power outlets. As shown 
m the diagram, the SYSTEM 
SAVER efficiently organizes your 
system so that one convenient, 
front mounted 
power switch 
controls SYSTEM 
SAVER, Apple H, 
monitor and printer 




SYSTEM SAVER provides cor- 
rect cooling. An efficient, quiet fan 
draws fresh air across the mother 
board, over the power supply and 
out the side ventilation slots. 



The heavy duty switch has a 
pilot light to alert when system is 
on.You'U never use the Apple power 
switch again! 



Easy Installation 



Just clips on. 
No mounting or 
hardware required. 
Color matched 
to Apple n.

If your printer uses your Apple 
more than yoti do, 
yott need The Bufferboatd. 



If your Apple is locked into the "PRINT" 
mode so much that you've taken up soli- 
taire to kill the boredom, you need a 
buffer. And if your computer is the Apple 
II or III, the only buffer for you is The 
Bufferboard. Expandable to 64K of stor- 
age. The Bufferboard stores an instantane- 
ous bucketful of print data from your 
computer Then it feeds the data to your 
printer at its own printing rate. Your Apple 
is set free from driving your printer and is 
ready for more data from you. 



or expensive power supplies are needed 
because The Bufferboard fits right into 
your Apple — and docks onto your existing 
printer interface. The result is convenient 





Take your existing interface — 
and buffer it! 

Only The Bufferboard has a simple 
Interface-Docking System. No bulky boxes 



and economical buffering of most popu- 
lar printer interfaces, including the 
Grappler-i-™ interface, Epson interface, 
and Apple printer interface. Thirty sec- 
onds and a single hook-up are all you need 
to end the printer waiting game forever. 

Up to 20 letter-size pages 
stored at a time. 

The Bufferboard comes standard with 
16K, and is expandable to 32K or 64K of 
buffering capacity with the addition of 




memory chips. This "bucket" will hold up 
to 20 pages of a print job, allowing you 
freedom to use your Apple. 

The Bufferboard — designed 
exclusively for the Apple Computer. 

Specifications: 

• Versions for Grappler -i- interface, Epson 
interface, Apple interface, and other popu- 
lar printer interfaces • 16K buffer standard 

• Upgradeable to 32K or 64K • Automatic 
memory configuration • Automatic self 
test • Includes interface docking cable. 

The Bufferboard is made by Orange 
Micro, Inc.; the same people who brought 
you the popular Grappler + printer inter- 
face. Both the Grappler + and The 
Bufferboard are now available at your 
local Apple dealer.

A General 
Problem Solving 
Program For 
Technical 
People: 

CALFEX™ 



CALFEX is more than a math 
program. It simplifies your task 
for routine or complicated 
analysis. 

CALFEX software is a generalized, menu driven program 
which makes it easy to do analysis on your personal com- 
puter. It is a powerful "WHAT IF?" problem solver. You only 
have to enter your equations and input values and CALFEX 
does all the rest. 

A great timesaver. Easy to leam and even 
easier to use. CALFEX eliminates all the input, output and 
printing statements which were often the majority of your 
programming time. Many programs can be created in min- 
utes instead of hours or days. Given inputs and your equa- 
tions. CALFEX calculates the answers and displays or prints 
the results. Inputs are easily changed. Variables may be given 
names or labels. You get the answers you need quickly, 
through a clearly understandable format. 

NO LrNIQL^E SYMBOLS OK LANGUAGE TO LEARN. 
Most problems can be solved without prior programming 
experience. Yet if needed, you have access to normal BASIC 
programming to expand its capabilities. 

OKGANIZEU AND DOCUMENTED PROGRAMS ARE 
easy with CALFEX. Your programs, theory and diskettes 
are easily organized and may then be kept in the binder 
Extra diskette holders are also provided. Finally you can 
have a consistent documentation system, which other peo- 
ple can understand. 

SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS, NUMERICAL INTE- 
GRATION, MAXIMA AND MINIMA can all be handled by 
CALFEX. Up to 10 simultaneous equations can be solved. 
Built in constants and functions simplify your task. Add 
your own if you like. Up to 120 inputs and 120 outputs are 
available in simpleorarray variables. You can save up to 10 
sets of inputs. 

A\* i Ycos (V + Z) 
^ 1 + BY^ In (Z/Y) 
Solve for Y? With VARIABLE 
EXCHANGE, CALFEX will do it for you. 
It allows the effective exchange of any dependent variable 
with an independent This powerful feature is of great impor- 
tance, since it's frequently difficult or impossible to solve 
your equations analytically for a given variable. Also it is not 
always obvious in advance which variables should be the 
dependent ones. With CALFEX you can easily exchange the 
variables at any time. 

APPLICATIONS PROGRAMS are being developed for 
various engineering disciplines including mechanical and 
electrical engineering.

One Apple 
and %575 
can make a lot of pies. 

And charts. And graphs. 



Introducing the New Personal 
Computer Plotter from 
Hewlett-Packard 

Now you can use your Apple® com- 
puter to generate your own presentation 
charts, graphs, and pie charts. How? 
Simply add on the new high 
quality, low cost HP 7470A ^"^^ 
Personal Computer 
Plotter. ^\ 

The 7470A helps you 
save time, save money, and, 
lets you communicate quickly, accu 
rately and effectively. 

The eye is faster. 

Data, when visualized graphically, becomes informa- 
tion fast. Charts and bar graphs can make any presenta- 
tion clearer and more readily understood. But asking your 
staff to produce the graphics 
for your next presentation 
doesn't ensure accuracy or 
artistic talent. And going to 
outside suppliers can be 
costly. Combined with your 
Apple® computer, the new 
HP 7470A plotter does the 
communicating for you. 
Quickly. Logically. And with 
off-the-shelf software. 

Fast and pretty. 

The 7470A gives you high plotting speed with excellent 
line quality. . .faster than any competitive small plotter. 
On top of all that, it comes in an attractive design 
package that looks nice on your desk. And it does it 
for only $1,575. (U.S.A. domestic suggested retail price.) 




Count on it. 

The 7470A is built the Hewlett- 
Packard way. To last. Designed and 
engineered with only a few parts, none 
of which require adjustment. And with 
customized integrated circuits 
that ensure reliability. 




Pen Pals. 

The HP 7470A has 
two single -pen stables 
" that output multi-color plots in 

your choice of ten coordinated colors. Pens 
are automatically capped and stored. 

An option youH want, too. 

For only $95, you can also get a 17057 Overhead 
Transparency Kit that turns your plots into transpar- 
encies for overhead projectors. For "1 need it tomorrow 
at 9:00 A.M!" meetings, it's a necessity. 

Start plotting your next presentation today. 
Clip and mail the coupon below. Now. 

Mail the coupon below and we'll send you — absolutely 
free — a sample plot, a more detailed brochure, and a

Discussion 



The Most Personal 

Apple produced the first open microcomputer 
system. This was more than a hacker's system 
because it allowed anyone to plug in new hard- 
ware. The new Apple He is even more open, be- 
cause now it has a sixty-pin computer slot in it. 
This is the main improvement. Every signal of 
any consequence is available to the new sixty- 
pin slot. What this means is that Apple has now 
introduced the first microcomputer that cannot 
be outdated. When the thirty-two-bit proces- 
sors arrive, and the big changes come about, 
you will be able to plug them into your lie. The 
6502 can then be used for I/O or graphics. 

What we need is to get Dr. Jeppson to write 
an emulation of the He for the Apple HI. He is 
perhaps the only one with enough guts to get 
the job done. 

Apple has now introduced the first truly 
personal computer, the Lisa. If Apple under- 
stands the market that this superb product 
should be targeted for, Lisa will sell like hot 
cakes. The reasons are simple. Now one man- 
ager, with a Lisa, can do the work of several 
managers who must use a manual system. The 
economics are also simple. Cut office labor 
costs by using the Lisa; more payroll cuts are

Well Done 

As a new Apple owner with kids, I was con- 
cerned that they would only be able to find ar- 
cade-style games to play, which were shoot-'em- 
ups and other forms of violence. Almost imme- 
diately I discovered the game Pie Man at my lo- 
cal computer store; I was first drawn to it by the 
cartoonish nature of the cover art. How won- 
derful it was for my kids and me that the con- 
tents continued that theme. Others had told me 
that the only way arcade-type games could real- 
ly be exciting was if they involved firing lasers, 
burning down buildings, shooting down para- 
chutists, or the like. Pie Man is none of these — 
no one is ever harmed and yet the action is en- 
joyable and exciting. 
David Erlich, Palo Alto, CA 

Old Faithful 

After several years of faithful operation, my old 
Hayes Micromodem II stopped working in my 
Integer Apple 11. 1 stuffed it in a box along with 
a brief note describing the problem and shipped 
it to the company in Georgia. What a wonder- 
ful surprise when a larger box was shortly re- 
turned to me containing a brand-new 1983 ver- 
sion of the famous Hayes Micromodem II. 

Still more wonders. Upon opening the 
invoice, I found that it was sent without charge. 
What more can a customer ask for? Needless to 
say, my ftiture communication needs, both 
hardware and software, will be satisfied with 
Hayes microcomputer products. 
Arthur H. Ude, Stoddard, NH 

He Too! 

I have been using Apple Writer II and Quick 
File II for about a month now and find these 
two software packages to be excellent. As a 
nurse anesthesia educator I have been using 
Apple Writer II for preparation of lecture notes 
with the greatest of ease and hope to use Quick 
File II for filing banks of test questions for pres- 
ent and future classes to allow for selectivity in 
printing and formatting tests. However, Quick 
File II may not be the most efficient package for 
test-authoring available. If readers involved in 
educational uses of the Apple He are aware of 
test-writing software that could help me, I 
would appreciate hearing from them. 

I am also interested in finding software for 
keeping gradebooks, attendance records, and 



comprehensive scheduling of class and clinical 
time equitably. Please help! 

Understanding that the Apple He is a rela- 
tively new machine, I have not expected an ava- 
lanche of software tailored for the lie's en- 
hancements. However, I hope that Softalk will 
soon include a separate listing of Ile-specific 
software in Fastalk. I am most interested in 
applications that will utilize the full two banks 
of 64K available with the extended memory 
eighty-column card I now own. For example, I 
would very much like to see a comprehensive 
review of The Incredible Jack. 

Another article that might be appreciated 
would be a tutorial covering the new Apple 
Dot-Matrix Printer that would include access- 
ing the array of printing fonts available through 
Apple Writer II. 

Stephen C. Smith, Houston, TX 
Easy To Be Hard 

If there are any Corvus hard-disk users that ei- 
ther have Apple Writer lie or are considering 
purchasing it, consider this. Though not men- 
tioned anywhere in the manual, it is possible to 
use Apple Writer He with the Corvus. All you 
have to do is type C while it is booting, and Ap- 
ple Writer lie will respond with "Enable Cor- 
vus in Slot 6 ? (Y/N)." Simply respond with a 
Y, and you are up and running on the hard 
disk. 

And to anyone who is looking for a great 
assembler, I highly recommend Merlin, from 
Southwestern Data Systems. Though it re- 
quires a 16K card, it is by far the simplest, while 
still the most sophisticated, assembler I have 
ever used on the Apple. It also includes Sourc- 
eror, an extremely easy-to-use disassembler. 
Jeff Jewell, Kennwick, WA 

Happiness Is 

Softalk is a magazine for users and, hopefially, 
manufacturers alike. I have several gripes, ideas, 
and suggestions for the manufacturers that 
would make people like me, a user, very happy. 

Last week I bought some items from Videx 
and from Apple. The products worked fine, but 
when it came time to fill out the registration 
forms the easy stuff stopped. Finding the serial 
number on the Videoterm was easy — I think. I 
still don't know if I got the right number. On 
the Apple letter-quality printer, I had to tilt it on 
its side to read the numbers. But the worst thing 
was on the Apple Super Serial Card. There are 
numbers all over the card, but not one of them 
looks like a serial number. When I first bought 
my Apple I got a NEC display with it. What 
does NEC do? It provides a separate card with 
the serial numbers on it. This makes it easy to 
fill out the registration form, and I had a serial 
number that I could put away with the instruc- 
tion manual. So much for the gripes. 

I have compiled a list of things that my 
friends and I think would be nice (really, a ne- 
cessity) to have on all software. The first thing is 
a fast-loading DOS of some kind. Most manu- 
facturers put this in with their copy protection. 
Another thing would make games playable on 
Apples that have the Enhancer II installed.

Don't use the escape key for anything — the En- 
hancer usually waits for something to follow so 
the program hangs. The simple solution would 
be to use a different key for pause, like return. 
While we are on the subject of pausing games, 
let's have a pause that waits a few seconds be- 
fore the game restarts. Trying to restart a game 
while holding onto a joystick and keeping your 
eyes on the screen all at once is very difficult. 
Why not just put a time delay of five seconds af- 
ter the restart key has been pressed? The last 
suggestion is that high scores should be record- 
ed onto the disk after the game has been played. 
The high-score system on Serpentine is a per- 
fect example of what I am talking about. 

If manufacturers would listen to these few 
suggestions, it would make computers and com- 
puter games more enjoyable. 
Timo Bruck, Long Beach, CA 

Emulation Indication 

I would urge all writers and publishers writing 
for the Apple II to indicate specifically whether 
or not the program will run on the Apple III in 
emulation mode. There are many Apple III 
owners who frequently put away VisiCalc in fa- 
vor of a good old game. Special thanks to those 
software publishing houses that already indi- 
cate this, such as Dakin-5, Infocom, and Blue 
Chip Software. 

Stephen M. Dorman, Clarkston, WA 
Cry If You Want To 

I loaned my filing program, PFS, to a friend for 
him to view. He returned it to me at a party. I 
didn't know what to do with it, so I put it on the 
kitchen cupboard. At the end of the party, when 
I went to get the program, to my dismay I 
found that ice cream had been spilled all over it. 
When I took it home and tried to boot it up, I 
found that the disk was all gummed in and 
couldn't turn in the drive. I thought that all was 
lost but decided to try opening the plastic case 
(after all, the program was shot anyway). 

I took out the plastic disk and rinsed it off 
with water and carefully blotted it with some 
toilet tissue. Then I took out the soft, now 
sticky, lining, cleaned the plastic disk case, and 
dried it off. I carefully put the disk back into the 
case and taped it shut. By that time the disk had 
fingerprints and stains on it. To my amazement 
the program booted up beautifully and has been 
working well ever since. 
Tim Anderson, Logan, UT 

Bucking the Averages 

My Apple II Plus (48K) is connected to a C. 
Itoh printer (model 8510) through a Grappler 
card, and I'm afraid that the printer is the most 
underutilized part of my system. This printer 
has many features, many capabilities, but I've 
found it difficult to use, because in my opinion 
the printer manual is not written for the av- 
erage user. 

D. G. Thomas, Erie, PA 
The Orange Oval 

I have recently acquired the third in a series of 
PES programs — PFS. Graph. They have all 



been excellent, with the latter exceptionally use- 
ful. However, the full capabilities have not been 
exercised because I mistakenly purchased a 
product from Orange Micro — the Grappler-I- 
printer interface. This interface creates ellipsoid 
pie charts instead of round ones. I have tried 
other boards at my local dealer and all work 
properly. 

Phillip P. Brown, Nashville, TN 

The manufacturer responds: 

PFS.Graph was rewritten by Software Pub- 
lishing Corporation to provide compatibility 
with the Grappler-I- last year. When this was 
done, the Grappler-H driver did not account for 
aspect-ratio variance. The original printer 
driver was written to interface an Epson printer 
with an Epson interface card. The hi-res screen- 
dump distortion was corrected by Software 
Publishing Corporation for this particular 
combination. 

The Grappler-h does not actually cause the 
distortion of the hi-res picture. Each printer 
brand will have a different distortion ratio be- 
cause graphics resolution values vary from 
manufacturer to manufacturer. This distortion 
ratio can be corrected only within the software. 

The technical staff has informed me that it is 
aware of the distortion, and that future ver- 
sions of PFS. Graph will adjust the aspect ratio 
for an output more closely resembling the video 
display. 

Bob Mickey, technical manager. Orange Micro, 
Anaheim, CA 

Preservation of Vital Assets 

The piracy of software is a business within a 
business. As soon as a piece of software hits the 
market — that is, the open market and not the 
computer stores — the product has been "bro- 
ken" and has begun its trek around the coun- 
try — in some cases, around the world. 

Software manufacturers appear to take the 
brute-force approach when dealing with this 
particular problem. They protect, reprotect, and 
double-protect their disks to such a point that 
some manufacturers' programs will not boot on 
my Apple disk drives. This protection hurts 
both the manufacturer and the end user. 

The manufacturer has to pay people to han- 
dle the phone and mail complaints arising from 
the protection schemes. This extra customer 
support amounts to added costs for the manu- 
facturer, which are passed on to the consumer 
in the form of higher software costs. The con- 
sumer has to face the problem of disk exchange 
from the local, "friendly" computer store, or 
possibly face the long wait and cost of replac- 
ing the disk via the mail. This experience can ul- 
timately lead to consumer resentment of a par- 
ticular software manufacturer, and that resent- 
ment can be transmitted like a disease, until it 
destroys one of a company's vital assets — 
goodwill. 

Take a hard look at the copy-protection 
policies. If manufacturers must protect their 
disks, they should make sure that any protec- 
tion technique they employ will be compatible 
with standard Apple equipment. If they find 



that a copy-protection technique is incompati- 
ble with some standard Apple equipment, they 
should correct the problem and provide the 
parties who have defective disks with a copy of 
the new release. A company that follows this 
course of action will engender good feeling 
among the consumers and subsequently in- 
crease its goodwill. 
David B. Martin, Fort Worth, TX 

Conclusions — On and Off the Mark 

A valuable and continuing contribution to the 
use of personal computers would be honest 
reactions and evaluations of software from 
those who've purchased and tried to use it. 

When I bought my first Apple II Plus, I 
bought a copy of Easy Writer Professional as my 
word processor. After easily learning VisiCalc, 
Information Master, and DB Master, I ap- 
proached Easy Writer. To put it bluntly — I 
failed, as did my daughter, who has a degree in 
computer science from a leading university. In 
frustration we traded it in for WordStar, which, 
though much . more expensive and requiring 
considerably more hardware, was at least a us- 
able word processing program. 

After becoming proficient in additional pro- 
grams, I decided to give the original Easy- 
Writer a second try. With a year of experience 
behind me, I did get the original Easy Writer up 
and running, but it is one of the most foolishly 
designed programs I've yet experienced. The 
manual is a disaster, and would be better placed 
in the area of fantasy games complete with hid-

den caverns, misdirections, and all the ploys 
found in Adventure and other such games. 

I recently obtained ScreenWriter II; once 
one gets through a somewhat ponderous man- 
ual, it works very well. ScreenWriter II is par- 
ticularly attractive in that it allows users to see 
the page format without an eighty-column 
board. (It displays up to seventy columns.) 
Compared to the Easy Writer products distrib- 
uted by Information Unlimited, it is infinitely 
superior. 

One thing that disturbs me about Softalk is 
the continued listing of Easy Writer in the Fas- 
talk column. Why do you continue to do so, 



knowing that it performs miserably? Had I pur- 
chased the program on the basis of the recom- 
mendation in Fastalk, I would conclude that 
these recommendations were bought and 
paid for.

purchased, is Apple II software and hardware 
compatible. Virtually all programs running on 
an Apple II will run on the Franklin. Likewise, 
virtually all Apple II articles, advertisements, 
and programs contained in the pages of Softalk 
are totally compatible with the Franklin. Why, 
then, are first-year subscriptions not available 
on the same basis to Franklin owners? I realize 
that it would make little sense to give the maga- 
zine to all 6502-based computer owners, but 
owners of Apple "clones" would get the same 
benefit as Apple owners. 

Perhaps you don't know where or even how 
to "draw the line." May I suggest that a pro- 
gram be developed that would fairly test for ar- 
chitectural and software similarity. Any com- 
puter that can run the program and produce 
meaningful output, unassisted by patches, 
should qualify for the free subscription. If you 
are really unrelated to Apple, then why leave 
out this segment of your market? 

I have been a well-satisfied reader of Sof- 
talk for two years, but only recently purchased 
my first computer. 

I will continue buying the magazine if you 
do not give me the free subscription; just like an 
Apple owner, I need it.

Send Out the Clones 

When the Apple "clone" machines, Orange II, 
Franklin Ace, and Pineapple, first came on the 
market, my initial reaction was to scream 
bloody murder. Arrest them, drag the perpetra- 
tors off to court, and sentence them to drawing 
hi-res pictures with a keyboard for twenty years. 
Here I paid a king's ransom for my Apple 
(bought from a dealer), and these companies are 
making a fortune by charging less than what I 
paid for a machine that does the same thing. 
The non-Apple owners are snickering up their 
sleeves while their "Franklinsteins" sport extras 
like built-in fans, numeric keyboards, volume 
control, and multijoystick capability. Apple 
software runs equally well on theirs, and they 
didn't have to mortgage the house and sell the 
dog to afford it. Well, they'll be sorry when Mr. 
Jobs and the Wizard of Woz take these compa- 
nies to court; meanwhile, I'll just pretend they 
don't exist and refuse to acknowlalge that the 
clone owners have any kind of computer at all! 

But when you think about it, the only major 
difference between the Apple and any other 
6502-based microcomputer is the software in 
ROM. A quick look in the back of the Apple II 
Reference Manual reveals listings of the Moni- 
tor and the Autostart ROM. Hardly a way to 
keep a secret and very helpful for advanced pro- 
grammers to learn more about the system. The 
question arises as to whether or not these com- 
panies are illegally undermining the success of 
Apple Computer, or just building machines that 
follow an industry "standard" set by Apple for 
a 6502 microcomputer, allowing use of the al- 
ready flooded software market for Apple pro- 
grams. A "hardware pirate," by my definition, 
is one who copies a device in design, right down 
to the silk-screened pc board. These companies 
have designed their own machines, with desir- 



1 



able improvements, and sold them for far less 
than Apple has. Let's face it, Apple has always 
charged more than it absolutely had to for its 
equipment. A good example of this is the de- 
crease in price of the Apple II disk drive, after 
the "compatible drives" hit the market. 

I don't see the harm in giving Apple Com- 
puter some long-needed honest competition. 
We will all benefit from it in the long run. I 
bought my Apple in June of 1980 and began my 
subscription to Softalk the same month. Apple 
was and still is the Cadillac of microcomputers. 
The quality control on the Apple II Plus is out- 
standing and dealer service (rarely required) is 
typically prompt. If I had to do it over again I 
might buy another Apple, but only if I was in a 
position to afford it. 
Bruce D. Youmans, Utica, NY 

Slow Down! 

I absolutely loved your March issue, partic- 
ularly all the reviews and part 2 of "Apple on 
the Phone." However, Softalk still has one big 
drawback — Fastalk. It has to be the silliest con- 
cept ever! It wastes about seven pages of valu- 
able space and serves no useful purpose what- 
soever. I would love to know how many people 
actually read Fastalk and use it for one reason 
or another. Do you want to know why I hate 
Fastalk? It's always wrong somewhere, some- 
place. For instance, since when are the 
S.A.G.A. adventures designated classics? 
They're fairly new and are merely spruced-up 
versions of the original Scott Adams adven- 
tures. I also feel that Hi-Res Adventure #2 is a 
classic, after being in the Top Thirty for over a 
year, as well as Zork I, for continuing to be in 
the Adventure 5 list and the Top Thirty. And 
what about DB Master^. Or Ultima'] Or Word- 
Star^. Or DOS Tool Kit'] Or LISA 2.51 All of 
these programs are definite classics and should 
be labeled so. And since when is Crossword 
Magic a classic? I have never even heard of it or 
seen it in the Top Thirty. And what about 
WayouP. If it can be a classic, then so can Chop- 
lifter, Snack Attack (which should be). Swash- 
buckler, and many others.

Of Stellar Modifications 

To Greg Tibbetts: First, let me say how much I 
enjoy SoftCard Symposium. It certainly has 
helped me to understand and appreciate the ca- 
pabilities and potential of Microsoft's Z-80 
card. I initially bought the card to allow access 
to CP/M-based word processing {WordStar) 
and found out there's a whole new and power- 
ful world wrapped up and plugged into slot 4! 
Along with learning CP/M from books and 
help from your column, I am also digging into 
the internals of the WordStar program and real- 
izing that there's a lot of variables that can be 
manipulated to customize the program to suit 
anyone's particular hardware setup. 

I guess the reason why I am writing is to ask 
for a little help. I am sitting here with an 80K 
Apple, Z-80 card, WordStar (3.01 P), and an 
NEC PC-8023. The printer is not being utilized 
to its full capacity. There are features that the

WordStar program is not calling and will not 
unless I load DDT.COM and have at the inter- 
nal workings. I've read the WordStar manual 
and will admit that I really don't understand 
how to install scrollup and scrolldown, nor 
backspace, nor a host of other little goodies that 
would be nice to peek and tweak this particular 
configuration. 

How about showing the power of DDT.- 
COM and other commands, as well as provid- 
ing us with a few vivid examples by using Word- 
Star as the guinea pig? 
Chris Steam, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico 

Greg Tibbetts responds: 

One of the most difficult things for a contribut- 
ing editor such as myself is the inabihty to be all 
things to all people. Your particular concern in 
this case is the WordStar word processor. It's 
certainly a valid concern and a widely used pro- 
gram. Among the thousands of other readers of 
the column, however, exist several hundred 
other legitimate and worthwhile concerns. It is 
not within my power to address each person's 
specific area of need. The best I can hope to do 
is act as a sort of guide through the programs 
and material shipped with SoftCard and with 
CP/M. 

Where possible during discussions on some 
of these programs, I do try to incorporate sim- 
ple examples with wide application that, un- 
like WordStar, will not create more questions 
than they answer. Each reader's need for Word- 
Star modifications, even assuming that all read- 



Teen Dream 

I think Bill Budge is a gorgeous hunk! Why 
don't you call him up for an interview some 
time, and pretend you're going to talk about his 
new Pintail Construction Set — but instead just 
take lots of pictures. You could publish the pic- 
tures and pretend you forgot to publish the 
text — and in the next issue publish an erratum, 
explaining that, golly, you left the text of the 
interview lying around somewhere but couldn't 
remember just where. Then, if Mr. Budge got 
upset, you'd go over to his house, pretend to re- 
interview him, but actually take more pictures. 

I think Doug Carlston is cute, too, but he's 
older. (I'm only 17.) 
Poppi Kosak, Novato, CA 

SoftGraph Glitch 

I have been following David Durkee's Soft- 
Graph series and have been avidly entering his 
programs each month. When my March issue 
arrived, I entered the Pie Chart program that 
appeared in it. 

It worked like a charm, except for one 
minor error. No matter which column of data 
you select to graph, the labels printed are the la- 
bels for the first column. In other words, if you 
elect to graph the data in the third column, the 
graph will be correct, but the labels will have the 
data from the first column. The error is in state- 
ment 740. The first command on that line 
should be changed from HF= 2 to read HF = 
PR(2) + 1. 

Norman L. Kushnick, Baltimore, MD 



ers have and use it, would be quite different, re- 
quiring considerable customization and expla- 
nation. To attempt even a light touch on this 
would be a book in and of itself. In fact, several 
books exist on the subject of WordStar, and 
most of these don't attempt to deal with the cus- 
tomization of that product. To deal with this in 
the few pages allowed me in the column would 
be unfair to the product, to the readers, and all 
in all would produce a less-than-desirable result. 

I hope this explains, at least in part, why I 
do not choose such topics as WordStar for ex- 
ample material. As to where one could go to get 
such information, you might seriously consider 
contacting MicroPro's technical-support sec- 
tion for the names of publications that discuss 
WordStar modifications. Personally, I have 
never needed to go beyond the WordStar man- 
ual and MicroPro's customization notes, al- 
though I do remember spending considerable 
time reading and rereading the same para- 
graphs before it became totally clear. In future 
columns, when and if the actual operating sys- 
tem information has been thoroughly dis- 
cussed, I will probably begin to take some of 
these subjects on.

A Real Nowhere File 

Doug Carlston suggested the following pro- 
gram line that enables users to catalog during a 
load or save by asking for a file with no name. 

25 VTAB 23: IF A$ = "" THEN PRINT 



CHR$(4);"CATAL0G";PRINT:PRINT 
:GOTO 20 

Why doesn't changing "" to CHR$(13) or 

CHR$(32) do the same? 

J. C. Gobins, Jr., Phoenix, AZ 

Doug Carlston responds: 

Input treats both of these characters in a spe- 
cial manner. If you hit return (or control-M, 
which is the same thing), this is a signal to input 
to stop accepting input. Therefore: 

10 INPUT A$: IF A$ = CHR$(13) THEN 

PRINT "AHA!" 
20 GOTO 10 

You will never be able to get an "AHA!" 
out of your machine, since the return you press 
will always be taken as a signal that input is 
finished. Likewise with CHR$(32), the space: 

10 INPUT A$: PRINT LEN(A$);" "A$: GOTO 
10 

Try entering the following: 

HELLO (then press return) 
HELLO (then press return) 
HELLO (then press return) 

Leading spaces are ignored by an input 
statement. If you had tried most other keys (one 
not treated in a special manner by input), your 
approach would have worked. 
Doug Carlston, San Rafael, CA

David Durkee responds: 

The "labels-in-two-columns" option was de- 
signed to allow labels of larger than eight char- 
acters, in which case the second column must be 
the one read for the second half of the label, as 
shown in the upper-left screen shot on page 76 
of the March SoftGraph. Making Mr. Kush- 
nick's correction will give you a different use for 
this parameter. The second column of the data 
will be the numbers that are graphed, which is 
useful as well, but it eliminates the possibility of 
using more than one column for labels, as was 
originally intended. This means that categories 
such as "Development," as shown in the screen 
shots, would have to be abbreviated to 
"Devlpmnt," or something similar. 

In short, you can have one of these options 
or the other, but not both. Incorporating both 
options would be possible, but it would require 
rewriting the parameter-input label-reading 
routines. 

Also, several readers have called to report a 
problem with SoftGraph. When Bar /Line Chart 
gets to the point where it is supposed to label a 
graph, it goes haywire and draws horizontal and 
vertical lines all over the screen. Those familiar 
with the operations of shape tables will instant- 
ly recognize what's wrong: The scale hasn't been 
set to 1 , so it has remained at its default value of 
0, which is the equivalent of 256. 

This was mysterious because the scale set- 
ting was supposed to be in the hello program (at 
the end of the February article), and, in fact, is 
there on the disk. Not so in the magazine. To 
correct this fault, change line 10 of the hello 
program to read TEXT: HOME : SCALE= 1: 
ROT= 0. Those who purchased SoftGraph on 
disk escaped the problem. 

If you want to see the kind of tribulations 
your ambitious counterparts who typed in the 
program went through, boot the disk, quit from 
the menu, type scale=0 and run. Then run 
Bar/ Line Chart as you normally would. 
David Durkee, Burbank, CA 

Jabbertalky 

In the March Softalk, Allen Munro makes a 
reference to Alice in Wonderland in which he 
claims the Mad Hatter says that words mean 
what he wants them to mean. 

Though very apt, it was Humpty Dumpty 
who made the remark, and it's from Through 
the Looking Glass. " 'When I use a word,' 
Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone, 
'it means just what I choose it to mean — neither 
more nor less.' " 
Timothy King, Monmouth, OR 

An Isolated Case? 

After one year with Apple and Softalk, I now 
appreciate the value of your publication. I 
would like to suggest, though, that writers pro- 
vide a brief bibhography at the end of articles 
when it applies. These references need not ex- 
ceed five items. This would greatly facilitate the 
spread of knowledge on the more obscure topics. 
The problem in my geographic location is a lack 
of computer stores or computer books in book- 
stores. An occasional mention of quality refer-

Poking the Byte out of the Bag 

Yes, I am game. I, of course, am writing in re- 
sponse to the responses to Mike Mahone's orig- 
inal reset problem. I myself remember a prob- 
lem I had not at all dissimilar to Mahone's a 
year ago. I was writing a program for my junior 
high school, and I wanted it to be totally 
seventh-grader-proof This was before I be- 
longed to Mini'app'les, and before I ever picked 
up an issue of Softalk. I called every computer 
store and computer person I knew, and the best 
answer I got was, "Flip the switch on the en- 
coder board so the user must press control-re- 
set." This did no good because I needed a soft- 
ware solution. I looked for hours before I found 
page 37 of the Apple II Reference Manual. I 
have been intrigued by the answer ever since. 

Whenever someone presses reset, the Apple 
takes a look at what is in locations 1010 ($3F2) 
and 1011 ($3F3). It takes the LSB out of 1010 
and the MSB out of 1011 and jumps to that 
location. To find what the address is, type 

PEEK (1010) + PEEK (1011) * 256. 

According to the manual, it is supposed to 
contain $E003. 1 found that to be true most of 
the time. Sometimes it has different addresses, 
but they all seem to be some kind of DOS

If that were the case alone, the reset key

there's more. When Apple came out with the 
Autostart ROM, it had to have some way of 
knowing whether the Apple had just been 
turned on or not so it could carry out the prop- 
er code to boot itself. (This is otherwise known 
as doing a cold start.) This is where 1012 ($3F4) 
comes in. It is affectionately known as the 
"power-up byte." The tricky Apple system 
Monitor checks to see whether 1012 ($3F4) con- 
tains the exclusive-or of $A5 (165) and what- 
ever is contained in 101 1. In Basic terms, that's 
peek (1011). Normally, this is $E0 (224). (Re- 
member $E003?) Therefore, if 1011 contains 
$E0, as it should, then 

$E0 (11 100000)= 224 
$A5 (10100101)=165 



EOR = $45 (01000101)=69 

If 1012 agrees with 1011 by containing the 
FOR of $A5 and the contents of 1011, then 
reset will jump to the location specified in 1010 
and 1011. If 1011 and 1012 do not agree with 
each other, the Apple thinks someone has just 
turned it on, and it reboots. Simple as that. I 
hope that is clear to you. 

For those of you who don't wish to figure 
out the exclusive-or after you have changed 
1010 and 1011 to suit your needs, the system 
Monitor has a routine to do just that for you. It 
can be accessed as follows: call 64367, in Basic; 
or call —1169; or from assembly language JSR 
FB6F. 

Therefore, if you want your Apple to jump 
to a specific location, do the following:

POKE 1010, ADDRS - ( INT ( ADDRS / 256) 
* 256) : POKE 1011, INT ( ADDRS / 256 ) 
: CALL -1169 

where ADDRS is the address you want it to 
jump to. If, however, you simply want it to re- 
boot, just set 1012 to a value that does not agree 
with 101 1. (Meaning, of course, that it does not 
have the EOR of $A5 and the byte contained in 
1011.) Try this: 

POKE 1012,X 

where X is any value that is not the exclusive-or 
of $A5 and peek (101 1). Zero usually works fine 
for starters. 

Now that you understand how the Apple 
treats the reset key, you can make reset do a 
jump to any location in memory. You can make 
it go to any machine language routine of your 
creation, so long as it can find its way back. 
(Remember, when reset is pressed, your Apple 
does a J MP to the location specified, not a 
JSR!) The addresses I like to use as a value for 
ADDRS previously mentioned are 54630 
($D566), which is equivalent to RUN, and 976, 
which reconnects DOS. 

I like to use the last one most of all because 
it doesn't appear as if reset is acting any differ- 
ently than normal, but it is actually reconnect- 
ing DOS. (Don't you hate it when you try to 
save a file you have been working on and it 
gives you an unappreciative syntax error?) 

There are many routines I would like to use, 
but I can't because they end in an RTS. For in- 
stance, try using 42350 ($A56E), which prints a 
catalog when called. It will work, up to the 
point when it tries to get back to Applesoft. In- 
stead, it will continue executing whatever is at 
the top of the system stack, which could mean 
disaster. Try it sometime (that is, when you 
don't have anything important in memory). I 
would like to use —3100, which displays page 
one hi-res graphics, but that also ends in an RTS. 

In this not-so-brief letter (my English 
teacher, who is also a computer buff, calls it an 
"article"), I hope I have opened up some inter- 
esting possibilities using the reset key. If you still 
need to know more, try (and I mean try) to read 
pages 36 and 37 of the Apple II Reference 
Manual. Also, even though I can't say I have 
read it, an article called "Trapping the Reset 
Key" appeared in Nibble, volume 2, number 5. 1 
did, however, read a letter responding to that 
article in Nibble, volume 3, number 7, that made 
some "vital modifications" to the program that 
would trap reset with an onerr goto statement. 
If anyone wants to know more, I'll be glad to 
try to help; I always like to have more people to 
exchange information with.

Meeow ! 

"Pokes 'n' Boots" (March Open Discussion) 
was great! I found it unsuccessful, though, in a 
security program I'm developing. With poke 
1010,102 and poke 1011.213 plus call 64367, the 
program restarted as expected. Then, when I 
punched in the correct code, every time thereaf- 
ter reset ran the hello program again. How can I 
undo the pokes so I can program in peace?

IF YOITRE CONFUSED 
PERSONAL COMPUTER, 



At this moment, there are no 
less than 50 personal computers 
on the market. And more are 
being introduced every day. 

On one hand, having all those 
options is a good thing. On the 
other. It can make picking the 
right one pretty difficult. 




Computers come in two parts. 
You have to buy both. 

Wed like to help. So here are a 
few suggestions about how to buy 
the computer that's right for you. 
Computers come in two parts. 

One part is the "hardware," 
which is the machinery itself. The 
other is the "software," or a pro- 
gram, as It's sometimes called. 

Software is the part that tells 
the computer what to do, the way 
a driver tells a car what to do. 

Without software, a computer 
can't do anything. 

And vice versa. 

You have to buy both. 
Buy the software first. 

Since the reason you're buying 
a computer is to get the capability 
the software gives you (remember 
it's the software that knows how 
to get things done), it makes 
good sense to pick the 
software first. 



Start by making a list of the 
things you want to use the com- 
puter for. It can include almost 
anything— any kind of inventory, 
filing, accounting, graphics, 
reporting, record-keeping, 
analysis -you name it and there's 
probably a software program that 
does it. 

Next, take the list into a com- 
puter store and ask the salesper- 
son to give you a demonstration 
of the program, or programs, 
that will do the things you 
want. 

Even though you'U 
need a computer 
for the software 
demonstra- 



tion, keep in mind the computer 
is just a vehicle. The software is 
the driver. And once you've 
decided on the software, picking 
out the rest of the computer sys- 
tem will be much easier. 
The simpler the better. 

Look for software that's easy to 
learn, easy to use, and that does 
the job in the simplest way 
possible. 

Good personal soft- 
ware should be, as the 
computer people say 
friendly." Meaning 
that it helps you 
do what you 
have to do 
without get- 
ting in the 
way 





Apr 



Mean- 
ing there 
are no com- 
plicated routines 
to follow to perform 
a simple task. And no 
programming 
language to learn. 
Some people, how- 
ever, will teU you that soft- 
ware has to be compli- 
cated to be powerful. 

• Nothing could be far- 
ther from the truth. 
Because in order for a 
program to appear simple 
to you on the outside, it has to 
be extremely complex on 
the inside. 



ABOUT BUYING A 
HERE'S SOME HELE 



Good software keeps the com- 
plications in the computer, where 
they belong. And keeps the capa- 
bility at your fingertips. It's that 
simple. 

You simply have to see 
for yourself. 

You can read any number of 
interesting books and magazines 
about personal computers. You 
can ask friends who have them. 
You can look at all the sales litera- 
ture you can get your hands on. 
And you should do all those 
things before you decide to buy 

But as helpful as all that can be, 
there r-eally is no substitute for a 
real, live demonstration. 

When you do go out shopping, 
we recommend you take a look at 
the PFS®Family of Software. 

The PFS family is designed the 
way we think all software should 
be: simple, straightforward and 
powerful. 

Currently three products 
make up the family PFS:FILE, 
PFS:REPORT and PFS:GRAPH, 
with more programs on the way 
Here's a little more about each 
of them. 

PFS:FILE. The simplest way 
to get organized. 

Basically FDjE works like a 
paper filing system, without the 
paper So you can record, file, 
retrieve and review information in 
a fraction of the time it takes with 
a conventional filing system. 

FEjE lets you arrange your 
information in "forms" you design 
yourself. So you can get at and 
really use your information in ^ ■ 
ways never before possible. 

What's more, FILE lets you 
change the original form without 
having to redo the information on it. 



PFS:REPORT. Making the most 
of your information. 

REPORT summarizes the 
information on your forms so you 
can use it to analyze, plan and 
make better-informed decisions. 

With REPORT, you get presen- 
tation-quality reports— sorted, cal- 
culated, formatted and printed- 
automatically in seconds. 
PFS:GRAPH. Instant pictures. 

GRAPH gives you presentation 
quality bar charts, line graphs, 
and pie charts, in black and white 
or color, on paper or the com- 
puter screen. To get a clearer 
picture of things and spot trends 
instantly you simply enter your 
information and specify the kind 
of graph or chart you want. 
GRAPH does the rest. 

You can also mix and match 
line and bar graphs, or even stack 
or compare up to four bar graphs 
simultaneously. 

And GRAPH will work with 
PFS:FILE, VisiCalc® files, or data 
entered directly into the 
computer. 

Best of all, compared to the 
cost of hand-drawn graphics, 
GRAPH can save you enough 
money over the course of a few 
months to pay for the computer it 
runs on.

I'd like to comment on Matt Offenbacher's 
poke 50, (any number from 0 to 254) mentioned 
in "Pokes 'n' Boots." (How about a section in 
So/talk devoted to these obscure peeks, pokes, 
and calls?) Location 50 is the video mask byte. 
If it has 255 then normal output; if it has 127 
then flashing output; if it has 63 then inverse 
output. Any other number will cause garbage 
output.

pany has been "moving around" lately but I 
have a return postage-paid envelope from it 
with this address. 

To Thomas Batson: I have both versions of 
Pascal that you mention — Apple's and the Sof- 
tech version for the Apple. I haven't used the 
Softech version very much. In fact, it is current- 
ly sitting unused. It represents certain enhance- 
ments to the system with regard to multitask- 
ing, screen control, and segmentation, but it has 
some serious problems in my opinion. First, it 
appears to be incompatible with many of the ac- 
cessory boards for the Apple slots that so many 
of us are fond of. This is supposedly handled 
with the user-definable drivers. This, however, 
requires thorough knowledge of assembler as 
well as the internals of the board in question. 
Softech provides some drivers, but not too 
many, and this leaves a large gap. A specific ex- 
ample: Softech Pascal will not even boot on my 
Apple, let alone operate, with the Novation Ap- 
ple-Cat modem installed. Calls to Softech have 
produced a shrugged shoulder and the com- 
ment from the company that Softech never 
claimed its Pascal would be compatible with all 
boards (but Softech never said it wouldn't be ei- 
ther). A call to Novation informed me that the 
company only advertises its board as being 
compatible with Apple Pascal. Sound familiar 
to any of your readers? Softech Pascal is more 
disk-dependent (swapping) than Apple's ver- 
sion. Unless you have enough disks on-line to 
leave the system files on-line at all times, it can 
be frustrating. Again, an example is that the 
filer code must remain on-line in order to do 
some of its operations. Not so with Apple Pas- 
cal; once you are in the filer, you can take the 
disk out. 

In closing, I would like to recommend that 
Thomas Batson get a copy of Apple Orchard, 
volume 3, number 2 (May-June 1982). This has 
a nice article by Dr. Wo on the various Pascal 
versions. I would have preferred that it be a lit- 
tle more critical in its review, but it is still a 
good, interesting article.

Translator Needed 

I have a data storage and retrieval program that 
runs in Pascal. I do not otherwise use Pascal. I 
do a great deal of word processing with Apple 
Writer II. It has dawned on me that I won't be 
able to make full use of my stored data until I 
can load it out of my Pascal text files into my 
Apple Writer II text files. 

I understand there is a translator program 
that will turn Pascal text files into DOS text files 
but that it needs a Pascal operating system, 
which I don't have. Does anyone have any 
advice? 

I suppose another solution to the problem 
would be to go to word processing in Pascal. 
I've had no success so far in finding out how to 
use Pascal as a word processor. Can anyone 
help?

eRAM 80 takes a shine to Apple. 

The eRAM 80 by Quadram is designed exclusively 
for the Apple He computer. It's an enhancennent 
card that builds character and innproves memory. 
Just plug into a special auxiliary slot in the back of 
the computer and eRAM 80 is ready to go to work. 

Double your viewing area. 

When the card is activated, see twice the amount 
of text on the screen. The eRAM 80 allows the 
monitor to display 80 characters per line with com- 
patible software. Instead of the usual 40. 

That uncomplicates things. Especially when 
it comes to word processing. And creating or 
editing documents. 

Increase your storage space. 

Besides improving character count, Quadram's 
eRAM 80 offers 64K of auxiliary memory. 
Whenever the Apple lie's internal memory isn't 



enough to handle all data and programming 
needs, let eRAM 80 take over. Even double 
storage space, up to 128K, by combining eRAM 
80 with some software. 

When using compatible software, it's easy to 
switch from the main memory to eRAM 80. So 
you can store and retrieve information needed. 
Quickly. And easily. 

What nnore could you ask for? 

Quadram puts the same traditional quality into 
eRAM 80 as put into all its other products. It's 
the kind of quality you can count on. The kind of 
quality also found in Quadram's Apple II, lie and 111 
Parallel Interface Card (APIC)and Parallel Interface 
Card with Graphics (APIC/G). 

More characters per line. More memory. More 
Quadram quality. That's eRAM 80. Look for it 
now at your nearest retailer $1 59.

modem and useful text-editing system. The 
original program was very simple to use and 
could be copied to any disk. This made it easy 
to use one disk for letters, another for reports, 
and so on, without having to switch disks or use 
two drives. One shortcoming was that non- 
ASCII letter codes were used. This made it im- 
possible to enter printer commands for print 
size, underlining, and the like. Another disad- 
vantage was that everything was displayed in 
upper case, making it difficult to read. Capital 
letters displayed in inverse did not help avoid 
capitalization errors. 

The following articles can upgrade your old 
Apple Writer program. For lower-case display 
and standard ASCII code files, see the Feb- 
ruary 198 1 issue of Creative Computing. A Dan 
Paymar or similar lower-case adapter is re- 
quired to display lower case. The June 1982 
issue tells how to incorporate printer control 
codes into Apple Writer files. For example, all I 
have to do is enter control-I and E to insert a 
file called Text.E containing the printer code for 
elite printing. Another article in the same issue 
tells how to preview your file on-screen just as it 
will print. 

For entering lower case into Basic pro- 
grams, see the April 1982 Call -A.P.P.L.E. To 
wire in the shift key, see the May 1982 Call 
—A.P.P.L.E. I had to figure out for myself how 
to add this shift-key modification to the Apple 
Writer program. It works great, except for spe- 
cial characters that normally use the shift key in 
Apple Writer. With my own shift-key mods 
these characters cannot be entered from the 
keyboard but can be kept in a file and inserted 
like printer control codes. In the same manner 
you could also print any graphic symbols avail- 
able in your printer, such as Greek letters. 

With lower-case display, use of the shift key, 
standard ASCII coding, and printer control 
codes entered into files, I think that my good 
old modified Apple Writer is the most versatile 
and easy-to-use text-editing program I could 
find. It uses the same keys for editing as Apple- 
soft uses. I laugh when I look at the compli- 
cated manuals of other word processing pro-

Gettin' Cookin' 

I am interested in hearing about anyone's ex- 
periences with software designed for the main- 
tenance of a recipe file, as well as other cook- 
book-related functions. I am already aware of 
Micro Cookbook from Virtual Combinatics, but 
I'd like to hear about some other products as 
well. 

Nancy Stanger, Chatham, NJ 
Dialing Data for Doc 

I have been reading with interest the "Apple on 
the Phone" articles, and now I have a question 
perhaps someone could answer. Are there any 
independent on-line databases? In particular, 
I'm interested in those relating to medicine. 
W. V. Cuthrell, Portsmouth, VA 



Community Conscious 

Our school uses only Apple computers, and we 
find them very reliable. We are pleased with the 
amount of materials available for it. The users' 
group that we participate in is for all types of 
machines. Do any readers have any informa- 
tion that would help us become better or- 
ganized, or activities that we could offer to the 
community? Our long-range objective is to offer 
a computer fair so that nonusers and potential 
buyers can see what a micro can do. 
Mary Ann Emerick, Bancroft, lA 

Major Announcement 

The 175th Medical Brigade, California Army 
National Guard, has formed a clearing house 
for military users of personal computers. The 
unit has established an Apple II software li- 
brary of military applications, as well as a data- 
base of personnel and units who are using any 
personal computer. Anyone interested may con- 
tact me, the clearing house project officer.

f Syntauri Corporation were just another high-tech com- 
— pany, its people would have some bright ideas, an Ap- 
M * ple-related product, and the business skills to sell it at a 
^ profit. While that's all true, something beyond brains 
and greed comes through when Syntaurians talk about 

I their work. 

Call it belief, passion, juice, or commitment. 
Listen to founder and president Ellen Lapham: "When I discovered 
the Syntauri synthesizer I said, 'Wow! This is what I want to do with my 
life.' It's fun because your heart and your guts are engaged, as well as 
your mind." 

Cofounder and software consultant Scott Gibbs says, "Everyone 
connected with Syntauri is cause-oriented." (As in true believer.) "There 
is never enough time to do all we want. Both Ellen and I are that way." 
Congratulations are in order. Gibbs and Lapham were recently married. 

The Original Syn. The attitude that this is more than just a job seems 
spread throughout the company. 

"I don't work for money," says marketing director liana Wiedhopf. 
"I work for productivity and creativity. Since age twelve I wanted to give 
something to the world. When I realized God gave me life, I asked my- 
self, 'What can I do with it?' There's a lot of that in Syntauri. 

"I believe in the product," she continues, referring to the Apple- 
driven, digital music synthesizer called the alphaSyntauri. The name is a 
play on the double star Alpha Centauri (our closest stellar neighbor) in 
the constellation Centaurus. 

"I can transfer how I feel about it to a broad number of people. That 



comes from inside. I have to preach and spread the word." She laughs 
self-consciously. "Yes, it's evangelism. Sometimes I get embarrassed. I 
start pounding." 

Senior software writer Steve Leonard was among the first musicians 
to buy the alphaSyntauri. At Lapham's urging he came north from Los 
Angeles to the company's home in Palo Alto, California, to help take the 
synthesizer from "an experiment for hobbyists to a performance ii ^tru- 
ment for professional musicians. 

"I love working in an art form with expressive people," Leonard 
says. "There's a fulfillment that is part of the magic of Syntauri. All the 
people in the company make it special. I feel lucky to have fallen into it." 

Lenore Wolgelenter, who has just left Syntauri after more than three 
years with the company, was the first person Ellen Lapham hired. "I en- 
joy art in a multitude of forms," says Wolgelenter. "I'm an artistic voy- 
eur. Syntauri gave me the outlet to be involved in a creative process. 

"The product is sexy. It's fun." 

Do You Believe in Syn? Sexy? Fun? Magic? True belief? Evan- 
gelism? What are these people talking about? Beyond the joy of music, 
they work, and play, in a new realm that treats sound as digitized data to 
be created, manipulated, stored, and retrieved lightning fast. 

'This is an orchestra in a keyboard," says Gibbs, who is part of the 
team of programmer/musicians that create the alphaSyntauri's power 
and flexibility. Their top-of-the-line software lets you record one sound 
over another (called sound on sound) and play up to eight "instru- 
ments" at the same time (called split keyboard). "Put them together in 
the right way," Gibbs explains, "and you have a multitrack system." 



Opposite page, top to bottom: Scott Gibbs, cofounder and software consultant; liana Wiedhopf, nnarketing director; Julie Roybal, operations 
director; and Robin Jigour, director of product development. This page: Ellen Lapham, president and cofounder. 



Syntauri calls it Metatrak. With another program, called Com- 
poser's Assistant, the Apple prints out in score form what you have just 
composed. 

Robin Jigour, Syntauri's director of product development, speaks 
proudly of what he helped create. "We have a sixteen-track recorder with 
our Metatrak software," he says. "It allows you to set up any track with 
any instrument, play it back at any volume, and hsten to it while playing 
on top of it. When you're finished you're not stuck with the piece as you 
recorded it. You can go back and change any of the instruments any way 
you want. This versatility and flexibility of the system is what attracts 
most professional musicians." 

Perhaps the best-known professional to endorse the alphaSyntauri is 
Herbie Hancock, jazz keyboardist and synthesist. Jigour calls him a mu- 
sician's musician. 

"If you can satisfy the professional market," Jigour adds, "you can 
derive from that and satisfy the personal market." 

Syntauri's personal market includes music students in schools and 
colleges, as well as families at home. Developing strategies to reach those 
prospects is the job of recently hired marketing consultant David Arch- 
ambault, who sees Syntauri facing a potential market as large as every 
home with a piano or organ. 

"The desire for a musical instrument in the home hasn't changed," he 
says. "It's still there, as strong as ever. Music is the next major area of 
computer exploitation. We'll see an increasing demand for a computer- 
based musical instrument as a home-entertainment device." 

Taking Aim. Archambault describes Syntauri's targeted home user 
with almost statistical precision. 

"Our home market is the young male professional, aged thirty to for- 
ty-five, married with young kids. He's already bought himself an Apple 
but hasn't yet purchased an organ or piano. Now the kids are growing 
up and he wants to teach them music." 

Buying a computer, disk drives, printer, video monitor, amplifier, 
and speakers, plus a keyboard, seems like a hefty investment for a child's 
musical experience. To the question, why not just get a piano, Lapham

says: "What is a musical experience? I can show you with a couple of 
spoons and a pie tin that we can make terrific music together. Anything 
creative with sound can be called musical. 

"Our focus is to broaden the musical experience. When I was a kid we 
had pianos, and all I cared about was exploring the sound capability with 
them, making thunderstorms or putting pencils and nails along the 
strings and listening to the weird effects. I also found that that wasn't 
done. Little girls don't go around making thunder sounds on pianos. In- 
stead you study classical piano, usually from a little old piano teacher 
who turns you off. 

"Everyone has had turn-off experiences in music because of the hmi- 
tations of the instrument. An alphaSyntauri doesn't impose these struc- 
tures because it's got so much programmability. You can go off with it 
and do what you want. You can explore. We are opening up what it is 
that's a musical experience." 

The theme of opening to greater creative possibilities runs through 
the Syntauri group. "I think people are not satisfied with a closed set of 
capabilities," says Wiedhopf. Part of her job as marketing director is to 
know what people want. 

"Syntauri gives them more variety than a piano. People say, 'Why 
should I buy a piano when this can play a piano and the flute and make a 
wa-wa sound and I can design any sound I want and compose?' People 
want music in their lives; the more creative they can be with it, the more 
they like it." 

Garage Sale. While on the subject of creativity, remember the story 
of how a couple of young guys at Hewlett-Packard built a microcom- 
puter in their garage and offered it to their corporate employer? And the 
employer didn't want it so they went out and started their own 
company? 

Syntauri's company history includes an analogue of that story. It be- 
gins with Charlie Kellner, a programmer/musician in Oregon. Kelber is 
fuzzy on the dates, but sometime in 1975 or 1976 he and a couple of 
friends in Salem built a synthesizer from an old organ keyboard, using 
hardware and logic only. 

"I have always underestimated the power of software," he says. 

In January 1979, Kellner came south to California to write educa- 
tional software. He couldn't afford to move his piano with him and 
wanted a substitute. While working in Silicon Valley he learned of 
Mountain Hardware (later to become Mountain Computer), which pro- 
duced a music synthesizer card. With an organ keyboard, an interface 
card, several thousand connections, and an Apple computer, he had syn- 
thesized music again. 

"The first software was primitive," Kellner says. "I was doing every- 
thing the hard way. But it worked out to a design similar to what Syn- 
tauri is using now." 

Kellner first offered his computer-driven digital music synthesizer, 
which he named alphaSyntauri, to his corporate employer, but they 
turned it down. The company? Apple Computer. 

"It would have been a good product for the company," says Kellner, 
who still does programming and research for Apple. "After a long deci- 
sion-making process, though, they decided they weren't in the music 
business." 

So Kellner introduced it on his own. He first showed the alphaSyn- 
tauri synthesizer at the West Coast Computer Faire in April 1979. Later 
that year it appeared at shows in Chicago (Consumer Electronics Show) 
and New York (National Computer Conference). "It was the hit of the 
show," he adds matter-of-factly. At the New York show EUen Lapham 
approached him about taking the product to market. 

"I had to decide whether to do it myself or go elsewhere," Kellner 
says. "There were too many possibilities at Apple for me to leave. And I 
didn't want to spend my life building synthesizers. Ellen and Scott con- 
vinced me that they had the talent and the know-how to make it success- 
ful. They were my best opportunity." 

Says Scott Gibbs: "Ellen was the person who said, 'This thing will 
go.' She always believed that it would take off. It took more convincing 
for me." 

Syncing Up. Lapham and Gibbs bought the rights to Kellner's syn- 
thesizer and the names alphaSyntauri and Syntauri Corporation, which 
they established in California. Kellner says their first agreement, written

on a napkin, was informal and based on mutual trust. 

Although his original idea was to sell Lapham and Gibbs all rights to 
the product, Kellner found himself involved in the early work of refining 
the synthesizer. At that time he took royalties in lieu of wages. Now the 
royalties have stopped. 

"I have no regrets," says Kellner, who is no longer involved with 
Syntauri. "Ellen and Scott have done an incredible job with it. They took 
the synthesizer farther than I could have. 

"The people at Syntauri are doing a very professional job," he adds. 
"The new software has features that can't be matched even by a $20,000 
synthesizer. It's way beyond my original concept. It's becoming 90 per- 
cent of what anyone would want to do with a synthesizer." 

Kellner also says the alpha's progress is a matter of musicianship. 
"Robin and Scott are both performers. They can add to software devel- 
opment what I couldn't. They know what to do with a synthesizer. It's 
the kind of experience programmers don't have. That's what's making 
Syntauri so successful." 

How successful has Syntauri become since it first started shipping 
product in December 1980? Lapham and her staff won't say exactly, but 
she admits to 1982 sales in the $1 million to $2 million range. Although 
the company has factors in its favor (an innovative, artistic, timely, soft- 
ware-based product promoted to diverse markets by bright, high-energy 
people), it is still a small start-up (only fourteen employees) facing a num- 
ber of challenges. 

Variable Barriers. New products, no matter how good, require edu- 
cating both consumers and dealers, as well as overcoming the barriers 
of resistance. According to Wiedhopf, the barriers vary with the market. 

"In the professional market," she says, "they know a lot about mu- 
sic, but they don't feel comfortable with the computer. In the education 
market, they love the fact that it has a computer. They love everything it 
has. The barrier is budget. In the home market, it's also economics, al- 
though as we ride the trend of increasing computer awareness we will 
do fine." 

Syntauri faces a more serious challenge in establishing a high-quality 



dealer network. They have only seventy-five U.S. dealers, with another 
fifteen overseas. Their goal is to double that number in 1983 and even- 
tually peak at four hundred. 

"The biggest problem we have now is finding dealers sophisticated 
enough to understand the computers and the music aspects," says Arch- 
ambault. Syntauri began by offering its product at computer stores. 

"The computer people are still learning their own business," he says, 
explaining why the alphaSyntauri sells better in music stores. "They 
aren't sophisticated enough yet to see music as the next major area. Some 
do, and as our dealers they do very well." 

Musical Sales. Since it now sees its product as fundamentally musi- 
cal, Syntauri has adjusted its sales strategy toward various music outlets. 
While the majority of its dealers are still computer stores, the highest 
sales volumes come from music dealers. These include the now-strug- 
gling piano and organ store (Archambault says organ sales in North 
America fell 42 percent in 1982), the high-volume music store, and the 
average pro-sound store. 

"Music is the most personal home entertainment medium," he says. 
"The prime dealer increasingly is the store with someone on staff who 
has a personal interest in the product, someone who has taught himself 
about computers and can see the way the business is going. They spend 
the time with the customer. People still need to have it demonstrated to 
them, even though they are accepting the technology." 

Syntauri's sales growth may have to be pushed through the bottle- 
neck of its ability to expand a supportable dealer network. "Much the 
way the dealer has to give personal support to the end user, we have to 
give personal support to the dealers," Archambault explains. Syntauri's 
dealer support also includes cooperative advertising, local seminars, and 
new point-of-purchase materials. 

While the keyboard synthesizer and its software have been well-re- 
viewed, Syntauri people talk honestly about the need for product 
improvements. 

Operations director Julie Roybal says their biggest manufacturing 
problem is a return rate of 5 percent on the music synthesizer boards.

MAY 1983 



which are made for Syntauri by Mountain Computer Company of Scotts 
Valley, California. 

"It's a complex unit and the quality control is not very good," she 
says. Keyboards, pc boards, and cables are subcontracted for manufac- 
ture to a local electronics company. Roybal estimates the return rate at 1 
per 100. "I would like to see that improved to 1 in 500," she says, al- 
though she adds that the quality improvement might not be worth the 
extra time and expense. 

Scott Gibbs has the precision of a mathematician (which he is) and 
the perfectionism of a classically trained musician (which he also is). He 
is not satisfied with the sounds from the alphaSyntauri. 

"I'm a purist in that sense," he says. "The sounds simply aren't good 
enough. The organ sounds are superb. Steve Leonard did those. The 
trumpet sounds are not good enough. The strings are definitely not good 
enough. A little postprocessing has to be done to make them sound real- 
ly snappy. 

"I think the boards in this system, without any more money being 
poured into them except for software development, can make fantastic 
sounds. There are people in the company who don't agree with me, but 
I'm sure of it. I'm working on getting the last ounce of quality out of 
these boards." 

A Delicate Balance. For Robin Jigour and his team of software 
writers, the problem is to keep a balance in meeting the needs of Syntau- 
ri's three basic markets: professionals, students, and home users. 

"We could go into one market and hit every key feature and need," 
Jigour says, "but that could mean abandoning others. The real chal- 
lenge is satisfying all of them." 

Jigour says the company also faces the problem of finding qualified 
engineers for its special product. "We need engineers with computer 
hardware and software experience and a strong background in music 
synthesis or music theory. It's a very select breed. 

"Now it's much easier because Syntauri is so well-known for what it 
does that people have been coming to us. In the earlier days we had to do 
the hunting. We were lucky to get a guy like Steve Leonard." 

Ellen Lapham and her team candidly admit to having made mis- 
takes and learned along the way. 

"I would have gotten more capital in sooner," says Lapham. "And I 
should have gotten my board of directors together sooner. Now I have a 
board that is absolutely colossal. I wish I had this crew a year ago." 

Heavy Hitters. Besides Lapham as chair, the Syntauri board in- 
cludes Julie Roybal's husband, Phil Roybal, manager of European mar- 
keting for Apple Computer; Tom Skornia, venture capitalist and former 
vice president of and general counsel for Advanced Micro Devices; 
Herbie Hancock; and Sam Bernstein, a former vice president of sales at 
Commodore Computer. 

"We should have been more efficient with our promotional dollars," 
Lapham adds. "And I would have loved to have hired a few people 
sooner, so we would have a broader software product line today. That's 
the dilemma of a start-up company. You have to focus." 

"I would say the major mistake was thinking of the synthesizer as a 
set of features rather than a set of benefits," says Wiedhopf. " 'The 
programs are written in Applesoft,' for example. 

"That type of thinking is related to our going to computer dealers 
first rather than music dealers. It's a common error in this industry. But 
one day you wake up and you hear consumers saying, 'What do you 
meari] I don't care about that.' Anyone marketing a high-tech product to 
consumers should forget what is inside or how it works. Tell them why 
they should buy it. What it will do for them." 

Scott Gibbs ponders the question of mistakes. "Did I make any mis- 
takes?" he asks himself in a whisper. "No, I don't think I made any mis- 
takes." 

What did he learn? 

"Be prepared to kill yourself in the process. I have given it my all, al- 
though I have a lot more left." He describes writing software as harrow- 
ing. "The concentration is the most exhausting thing I have ever expe- 
rienced. The only way I can finish something is by working fourteen 
hours straight. Then I collapse for a day. I'm always thinking about 
something. It's like an irritation until the problem is solved." 

Lapham is clear about what she has learned. "Understand what cash 



flow really means. Cash flow is the bottom line for any start-up compa- 
ny. I don't have to worry about return on investment yet, but I sure have 
to worry about whether I can pay my bills. To have controls in place for 
cash-flow management is very important. 

"You can't afford mistakes or fuzzy thinking in a start-up," she says, 
"especially in high-tech types where the technology is moving — or you 
are moving it — faster than anyone else. Managing in an environment of 
constant newness means you have to hire people who are good at 
self-managing. 

"The hardest thing in dealing with a start-up is the people part. With 
technology, if you throw enough time and money at a problem you will 
probably solve it. But getting the people who can pull that off, providing 
the internal working relationships that have them feeling satisfied and 
happy and feeling good about being a team, that's the trick. 

"It's important that lines of communication are established and 
maintained, that there's trust between people and a certain amount of 
professional respect. You get that by having communication. My job is 
to be sensitive to when it breaks dovra and provide the structure for com- 
munication to occur." 

The Lapham Guide to Success. "Hire the absolutely best people you 
can early on in the game; people who are not only motivated but who are 
as experienced as you can get. You don't necessarily have to get the 
heavyweights in the industry. You need people who have functional skills 
and a certain amount of self-confidence. I have a team of terrific people 
who are highly motivated, with high energy, who are willing to take the 
personal risk of tackling something they haven't done before." 

Lapham points to Lenore Wolgelenter, her first employee, as one 
who had the courage to risk doing what is new and different. 

"She's not a musician, but she went out and did the demos at all the 
Applefests. She's not a computer programmer, never held a soldering 
iron, no 'techy' skills whatsoever. But good 'people' skills and high 
energy. 

"We have what everyone feels is a high-tech product. But it's a people 
product. It's as high-tech as a piano or as low-tech as a kazoo, depend- 
ing on what you want to do with it." 

The Syntauri people all seem to love putting in long hours. Typical- 
ly, they work ten to twelve hours per day, six days a week. Some longer. 

"I'm always thinking about something Syntauri-related," says Gibbs. 
"It never stops, except for short vacations or when I get sick." 

"It's with me every day," Steve Leonard says. "Even when I'm ! 
watching TV. That's how I problem-solve. It's the nature of the indus- 
try. Also, there's competition. It's what you have to do to make it the 
best." 

Wiedhopf says she doesn't count the hours. "My dream is to be able 
to work forty a week. Sometimes it's eighteen hours per day. Sometimes ; 
when I burn out it can be five." To deal with the stress she swims an hour 
a day, spends two or three hours per day with her teen-age daughter, or 
turns to music, preferably Bach fugues on violin. When it gets really bad 
she turns to country music. 

Lapham and Julie Roybal deal with the stress through the relaxation 
of massage. "Your body and your brain are tied together," Lapham 
says. "The massage gives me a chance to concentrate on relaxing my i 
body. Countering stress also means putting things in perspective and y 
dealing with them one by one." \ 

Roybal puts the long, hard hours in a different perspective. "It's not ; 
the number of hours you spend. It's how you feel about what you're do- 
ing. This has been the most dynamic, eye-opening, emotionally demand- 
ing experience of my life. I have become much more attuned to my own 
strengths and weaknesses, and much more sensitive to others." 

Command Performance. It all comes back to those intangibles; what i 
Lapham calls the "psychic satisfactions" of managing a small, innova- 1 
tive company. 

"I have a gut belief in what we're doing," Lapham says. "I can't re- 
late on a day-to-day basis with what Herbie Hancock does, because I 
don't have Herbie's musical skills— his 'chops,' as they say. 

"But I can relate to every kid who is taking music lessons. All of us j 
are musicians at heart. The synthesizer lets me be a kid with my own i 
product. I think that's great. It's a lot more fun than business-systems ! 
software."

Mind Your 




BY PETER OLIVIERI 




May is one of the nicest months of the year. Here's hoping that as 
you read this you're relaxing somewhere and enjoying some fine weather. 
After all, what could be more pleasant than soaking up some sun, sip- 
ping a refreshing drink, and reading the most recent issue? 

Looks Are Everything. When it comes to printed output, looks are, 
indeed, everything. Often, a report with quality content fails to get the at- 
tention it deserves because it doesn't "look professional." And often, a 
report of lesser quality wins an audience solely as a result of its attractive 
appearance. It stands to reason, then, that whatever you can do to en- 
hance the appearance of your material will probably increase its chances 
of being read and taken seriously. 

Such things as type style, paper quality, and how the document is for- 
matted are important factors in how "professional" a document looks. A 
good-quality daisy-wheel printer can give you very professional-looking 
output. In addition, by changing the print wheel, you can get various dif- 
ferent type styles. (A similar effect can be achieved using a dot-matrix 
printer if that printer has certain options. For example, many Epson 
users have said that printing in emphasized, double-strike mode results in 
near-letter-quality printing. Of course, there is some sacrifice; printing 
speed is slowed considerably, for one thing.) 

It's also possible to get different typefaces by means of software. This 
approach is often a bit less expensive than purchasing a letter-quality 
printer. With that in mind, look now at Type Faces, a new program from

Alpha Software Corporation that allows users to incorporate some in- 
teresting options into their printed material. Type Faces is a powerful, 
easy-to-use program for printing in different fonts. It can be used to pre- 
pare business presentations, professional-quality invitations, letterhead 
stationery, special announcements, personalized cards, and attractive 
signs. 

Type Faces requires 64K of memory, two disk drives, and a printer. The 
printers it supports include the IDS 460/Prism 80, IDS 560/Prism 132, 
Epson 80/100, Trendcom 200, and the Silentype. (The Epson and IDS 
printers must have the graphics option.) Note that Type Faces supports 
regular parallel and serial printer cards but is not compatible with 
"smart" printer cards such as the Grappler and Microbuffer. 

The intent of this package is to allow the user to print text in a vari- 
ety of fonts. The actual characters printed are about five-sixteenths of an 
inch high (about the equivalent of two lines of single-spaced, normal 
text). Thus, Type Faces has not been designed as a multiple font pro- 
gram for your word processing applications but more as a means of 
creating attractive signs and announcements. The results are indeed at- 
tractive. Not only are the characters clearly formed and easy to read, but 
the variety of characters available is quite appealing. Sixteen different 
type styles available are shown on this page. 

The user guide is quite clear, and in no time at all you can learn how 
to print out text in a variety of formats. Besides being able to enter text.

save it, and print it out in the font of your choice, you can use Type Faces 
to list all the file names in your directory, list your original file on the 
printer, delete a file from disk, pack the data on disk in order to take ad- 
vantage of any unused space, format a blank disk, move backup copies 
of data disks, copy a EXDS text file, and copy a CP/M text file. 

The program can read files from those word processors that store 
data in DOS text files and it can also read files generated via WordStar 
and other CP/M word processing programs. In addition, any file created 
by a Pascal editor can be copied onto the Type Faces data disk, and later 
on such a file can be typed out in any face you choose. 

Left Face. Besides printing the contents of your text file, you can 
embed format commands within the text itself in order to achieve for- 
mat variations. Here are some examples: .ce — this will center the next 
line; .ul — this will underline the next line; and .sp 3 — this will skip 
three lines. 

The print commands are reasonably extensive and include spacing 
commands (spaces between lines, line heights), print enhancements 
(underlining, changing character sets), page organization commands 
(headers, footers, and page lengths), and line organization commands 
(justification, indenting, and so on). Type Faces also offers a "compre- 
hensive" mode for the editing of files. In this mode, characters can be 
searched for, lines inserted and deleted, text saved, characters substi- 
tuted, and so on. 

For applications requiring a poster, sign, or announcement. Type 
Faces may be just right. Please note that you'll need 64K, that the prod- 
uct supports only certain printers, and that it's not a replacement for a 
letter-quality muliple-font printer for word processing. 

Quick File III. Database management is an application area of great 
interest to most businesses. DBMS packages range from the simple to 
use (such as PFS. File) to the more complex, full-function database (such 
as DB Master). One of the database packages created for the Apple III is 
Quick File III from Apple Computer. To use the program, you need an 
Apple III with a second disk drive or a ProFile hard disk. A printer. 



while not required, is highly recommended. 

Quick File III was designed for somewhat less complex applications 
than a program such as DB Master might be used for. The name is an 
appropriate one — Quick File III can be learned quickly and retrieves da- 
ta quickly. To most users, these are important features. Some possible 
applications for this package include keeping and retrieving data on ex- 
pense accounts, travel itineraries, appointments, business contacts, per- 
sonnel reports, telephone lists, and so forth. 

This database management system allows the user to show the infor- 
mation in the database on-screen in the order and format that is most ap- 
propriate to a particular application. There's a good deal of flexibility in 
this regard. Information can be sorted in any order, and reports can be 
easily prepared. Searches through the database can be made to select on- 
ly information that meets certain user-defined conditions. 

One of Quick File Ilfs nice features is that it takes advantage of the 
Apple Ill's special characteristics. Thus, let's suppose that the records in 
your database have been called to the screen. To look through the rec- 
ords, you simply use the arrow keys (to move left and right one charac- 
ter at a time), the up and down arrows (to move up and down a line), and 
the tab key to move to the next piece of information (that is, to the next 
field). Combining the open-Apple key with these keys enables the user to 
move backward by field, move to the beginning or the end of a file, and 
up or down the screen page by page. There's also a help screen that al- 
lows you to seek clarification if you don't understand something; this fea- 
ture is another indication of a well-designed system. 

For example, suppose you're looking at the names of the depart- 
ments in which all the people in your database are employed and you 
wish to look at all the records of the people in a particular department. 
Let's further suppose that you're not sure how to use the "find" feature 
in Quick File III. Your first step would be to invoke the "help" option by 
pressing the open-Apple key and the letter H at the same time. You'd 
then be presented with a series of help screens, one of which deals with 
the find command. You would see the following on-screen summary 
(all of these commands are preceded by pressing the open-Apple key): 

A Arrange (sort) on a category. 

B Go to beginning of file. 

D Delete records. 

E Go to end of file. 

F Find all records [hat contain. . . . 

I Insert new records before the current record. 

K Ivlake a duplicate copy of the current record. 

After choosing F (by pressing open-Apple F), you'd be asked to en- 
ter the information you were searching for. It would then be brought to 
the screen for display. 

Quick File IITs screen displays are designed to be as informative as 
possible. You always know where you are in Quick File III, what you are 
currently doing, and how to get back to the main menu; this informa- 
tion is displayed directly on-screen. 

Sorting is also quick and easy. You simply place the cursor on the 
field that you wish to have sorted and press open-Apple A (for arrange). 
The arrangement order can be A to Z, Z to A, 0 to 9, or 9 to 0. 

One of the unique features of this package is that it offers you two 
record layouts. (A record is a collection of information about one mem- 
ber of your database. One piece of information in a record is called a 
field) These two record layouts are called the "multiple record layout" 
and the "single record layout." 

As the name implies, the single record layout displays all of the fields 
of information about one member of your database. The multiple rec- 
ord layout displays the data for several records. Users may choose to 
have this layout display only the records they're interested in, rather than 
all of the records in the database. This is extremely handy, since it allows 
users to create different data-collection forms, different record-update 
forms, or different screen displays according to the particular needs of 
the time. It is also quite easy to rearrange a record format into a differ- 
ent order or to specify a different selection of fields. 

Quick File III also has a report option. The two report styles avail- 
able are "tables style" (in which information is shown in rows and col- 
umns and only one record can appear on one line) and "labels style" (in 
which information is displayed in a vertical format and data from a sin-

SMART CUSTOMERS HELPED DESIGN 
OUR NEWEST PROGRAM. IT SORTS, 
LISTS, SCANS, TOTALS, SEARCHES 
AND DOES AMAZING TRICKS! 



The story behind our new program. 

No sooner had we introduced our first checkbook 
accounting system last year, than customers began 
calling and writing. They said they loved the 
program, and then began pestering us to produce a 
new program. 

For example, Leo de Gar Kulka of Foster City, 
California wrote saying: "I've tried five checkbook 
balancers for the Apple. Yours is best. But you need 
to take one more step: Make it do bookkeeping. 
Right now you almost have a business ledger with 
as many categories as you give". 

Then there was the letter from Mike Merren, a 
neurologist in San Antonio, Texas: "I find it an 
excellent program and use it for my wife's small 
business", he wrote, adding that it could become a 
"cash basis" bookkeeper if it sorted cleared and 
uncleared checks together. 

Kellar Watson, a retired druggist from Orange, 
California explained that he manages his children's 
trusts: "I use your checkbook accounting program 
and now find it would be almost impossible to live 
without it". He went on to suggest that any new 
program allow sorts by fiscal year. 

A general contractor in Portland, Oregon suggested 
our new program include a sort-by-payee feature: 
"That way I could do job costing and file IRS 1099s 
directly from my checkbook". 

Doyle Lee, a computer store owner said, "For small 
business, your checkbook accounting system is 
usually better than a full-blown accounting 
package. But your new program should include 
running sub-totals of category codes. With those, 
anyone could create customized reports". 

A local CPA suggested we add new audit trail 
features: "Make your new program sort by amount, 
entry order, and uncleared checks. Make it print a 
"trial reconciliation" to help balance the bank 
statement. 

He also suggested our new program create a 
cancelled check file: "Which leaves checks in the 
order which you get them back from the bank, but 
allows a user to find disputed checks fast". 

Money Streetlllt's totally new. So, we 

went to work and created a brand new program. It's 
called Money Street, and it's a checkbook 
accounting system like none you've ever seen. We 
did all the things our customers asked for, and 
added over 25 other features. 

For example, you can sit before your computer and 
scan an electronic file of checks at the rate of 500 
per minute. You can enter a check and instantly see 
a "category year-to-date total". You can find a 
cancelled check in a file of 1200 checks in 90 
seconds. 

Money Street prints reconciliation summary of each 
balancing session. It prints a complete checkbook 
history showing every entry, plus the running 
balance each step of the way. Money Street lets 
you edit any entry, anytime; before, during, and 
after entering it into the system. 



It can sort checks into tax deductible categories. It 
manages unlimited checking accounts; one 
program does it all. It's documentation includes 
tutorial, on-screen demo, program map, samples of 
all important screens, plus samples of all reports. 

It allows you to code deposits, too. That means you 
can track income, sales, and taxable items. Mix 
checks and deposits into one category, and create 
net amounts. 

Academy Award. If programmers got 
Academy Awards, then Don Hill deserves it for 
Money Street. Don zips you around the program in 
seconds. His error trapping simply won't allow you 
to make invalid entries. His prompts always tell you 
where you are, what you do, and how you exit. 
There are no dead ends, no traps, and no fancy set- 
ups. 

Best of all, his 15 ready-to-print reports require only 
four key presses. He included a place for your 
name, your account name, and today's date. He 
even created a special way to "talk" to your printer. 
For example, you can tell an Epson to print 
emphasized type faces. The reports look like this:

One $99.95 package does it all. That's 
because one Money Street package handles 
unlimited checking accounts, it works for calendar 
or fiscal years too. At years end, the program rolls 
over into the new year in less than two minutes. 

Better yet, all your business and tax data is 
confidential. Your personal financial life is your 
own. It's a private matter between you and your 
computer. 



How it works. On your computer screen, 
you create a facsimile of your checkbook. You see 
17 items per screen, and can scroll for more. It looks 
like this:

Money Street's most amazing feature is its "real 
time" data bank. It accumulates year-to-date totals 
for each of the 100 categories. You see these totals 
instantly. Just enter a check, and look at the bottom 
of the screen. The year-to-date total will flash into 
view with each new entry. So, you get constant up- 
dates as you enter data! 

Here's how you set up your code categories. Press 
Ctrl-0 and a screen-behind-the-screen instantly 
appears. Then just type in category names. You can 
add, change, or delete category names anytime 
without affecting data. It looks like this: 



OO/LEMON PURCHASES 
01/SUGAR PURCHASES . 
02/CUPS. STRAWS. MISC^. 
03/»TOTAL INVENTORY

OS/LEMONADE SALES

09/»»PROFIT OR LOSS«» 

10/ 

11/SALES TAX 

12/INCOME TAX 

13/» TOTAL TAX . , _ 



Look again at the Dictionary, and you'll see all the 
year-to-date totals, plus a count of items. The count 
is very handy for checking on items requiring 
monthly payments. 

Better yet, the Dictionary will let you sub-total 
groups of category codes. In the example above, 
code three totals all the categories above it. To get 
group totals, just start any category with an 
asterisk. Two asterisk creates grand totals. 

Includes tutorial, map, and reports. 

Money Street includes Program Map, complete 
documentation, and samples of all reports. For 
Apple® II, II -I- , lie, and III in emulation. Requires 
3.3 DOS, 48K. Money Street works with one drive, 
but two are preferred. It's also okay without a 
printer, but you'll miss a few reports. Master 
Charge, Visa, COD okay. Add $2.50 on all orders for 
postage and packing. Back-up $10. 

Money back no matter what. Why not 

give us a try? As with our other programs, if you 
aren't delighted, we'll give you a full refund (on mail 
order purchases from us, only).

gle record may appear across several lines). The tables-style report for- 
mat permits you to subtotal and total categories and to calculate a new 
"column" based on information from other columns in your table. Ex- 
amples of the labels-style report format include mailing labels, index 
cards, recipes, and so on. In the course of designing your reports, you can 
delete columns, switch columns, sort information, and set the appropri- 
ate printer options. Report formats can be saved for recall later. 

The documentation is well done. Examples are plentiful and you can 
become familiar with the features of the program very quickly. Users of 
WPL (the Word Processing Language from Apple Writer III) will be 
pleased to know that it's possible to transfer Quick File III reports \.o Ap- 
ple Writer III. Thus, any such reports can be included as part of a docu- 
ment you've prepared using that word processor. 

Here are a few other guidelines of interest. 

Number of files per disk: twenty-six. 

Number of categories p)er file: fifteen. 

Length of a record: 1,140 characters (maximum). 

Length of an entry: seventy-six characters (maximum). 

Number of characters in a file name: twenty. 

Number of characters in a field name: twenty. 

As you can see, this is a fairly thorough database management pack- 
age. It does have a limitation, however, that may be significant to some 
users. This limitation concerns the number of records allowed in a file. 
Assuming an average record size of seventy-five characters, you can store 
250 records per file on a 128K Apple III and 550 records per file on a 
256K Apple III. Note that the file size is not a function of the capacity of 
the disks being used. More specifically, if you have a 128K Apple III, 
20,000 divided by the record size equals the number of records per file. 
Thus, this program is only appropriate for relatively small files. It is ex- 
cellent at managing files of this size, and if your applications fit into this 
category, you'll probably be very pleased with Quick File III, its docu- 
mentation, its speed of operation, and its variety of features.

of the hints, helpful suggestions, and questions that have come in 
recently. 

Epson Edification. One of the most frequently asked questions has 
concerned reference materials for the Epson. In particular, readers were 
interested in knowing how to use an Epson printer with Apple Writer II. 
One way to find out is by reading Minute Manual for Apple Writer II, 
published by MinuteWare (Columbia, MD) and written by Jim Pirisino. 

This eighty -page manual would be useful to an Apple Writer II be- 
ginner, to someone who is constantly being asked to show others how to 
use Apple Writer II, and to anyone who wants to learn more about the 
hardware that can enhance the package. The book provides an excellent 
summary of the Apple Writer II commands and procedures and explains 
how they work. There's even a brief section on WPL, but don't expect 
this guide to help you there. 

The book also contains a twenty-two-page chapter on using the features 
of the Epson printer with Apple Writer II. In addition to general instruc- 
tions, the chapter includes information on condensed mode, double- 
width mode, condensed/double-width mode, double-strike mode, em- 
phasized mode, italics, underlining, backspacing and overstrike, unidi- 
rectional printing, and subscripts and superscripts (in normal, empha- 
sized, and double-strike modes). In addition, there's a section explaining 
how to create a glossary of all the printing commands. Finally, the Ep- 
son chapter describes how to display and print some of the special char- 
acters not shown on the keyboard. 

If you're still having trouble getting your Epson to do all that it 
should with Apple Writer II, you'll certainly want to consider obtaining 
this guidebook. 

Tracking Epson. Harding Rees of Los Gatos, California, sends in a 
suggestion for those who are having problems with the tractor feed 
mechanism on their Epson printers (as was Paul Metzker, Mind Your 
Business, December 1982). The problem is that the margins begin to vary 
after a few pages and the tractor teeth begin chewing up the paper. 

The Epson manual is remiss, explains Rees, when it talks about in- 
stalling the paper separator, the metal rack that is supposed to allow the 
paper to feed smoothly. After connecting the paper separator to the 
printer, it's necessary to inspect the metal rack carefully to be sure that 
the rack doesn't rest in contact with the top surface of the printer, thus 
pinching the paper between the rack and the printer surface. If the paper 
is pinched, with even slightly more pressure on one side than on the 
other, the paper will wander toward the side as it feeds through and will 
cause trouble by the time the fourth or fifth sheet is being printed. The 
solution is to bend the two shorter wires at each end of the rack down 
slightly, allowing the paper to slide under the rack without being 
squeezed between it and the printer surface. 

Rees also has a question for other B.U.G. members. He'd like to 
know if anyone is using the Epson with Quick File III or VisiCalc III. If 
so, how can one get the printer to print with a single line feed when using 
these packages? 

VisiCalc Help. Here's a call for help from Robert Krandel of San 
Jose, California. He wants to get a count of numbers in a column that 
fall within different ranges. If, for example, he had a column titled 
SALES that contained the dollar amount of sales for forty different 
salespersons, he'd like to be able to use the VisiCalc function COUNT 
to determine how many salespersons had sales between $0 and $50, how 
many had sales between $51 and $100, how many had sales between $101 
and $151, and so on. 

C'mon all you puzzle-lovers — what's the simplest solution? There's 
probably a solution involving the IF command, but it looks compli- 
cated. Let's all try to come up with something and meet back again soon 
to .compare what we've worked out. 

It's Almost June. Well, we've rambled over enough territory for this 
month. If you get the chance before next month, get in touch. Include 
complaints, compliments, questions, suggestions, hints for other read- 
ers, goals for B.U.G., whatever. Take care until then.

Not long ago, there weren't many programs intended especially for 
the very young computer user. Lately, however, new companies that 
specialize in creating software for young children have popped up, and 
established companies have responded as well. In the course of this 
month's column, we'll look at a few of the choices available to kids and 
their parents. 

But First, What Else Is Happening? As summer approaches, com- 
puter users of all ages are being bombarded with educational oppor- 
tunities. Conferences, workshops, institutes, and computer camps all 
over the country are promising an embarrassment of riches, including 
information, experience with software, and exposure to new ideas and 
applications, in environments especially conducive to the development of 
skills. 

Let's take a few minutes now to consider a few special summer pos- 
sibilities, some of which may hold particular appeal for you. 

The fifth annual National Education Computing Conference takes 
place June 6—8 in Baltimore, Maryland. Hosted by Towson State Uni- 
versity, the conference is the product of cooperation among nineteen sci- 
entific and professional societies involved in educational computing. 
Stated objectives are to present major work regarding computers in 
instruction, to promote interaction among educators and others at all 
levels, to develop and coordinate the activities of various professional or- 
ganizations, and to produce a proceedings that documents the status of 
computers in education. 

The conference will feature survey and tutorial sessions by invited 
speakers, presentations of contributed papers, and special panels. Topics 
will include the current status of the educational use of computers at the 
national level and projections for the future. Informal "birds of a 
feather" sessions will be scheduled throughout the three-day program so 
that attendees with common interests, problems, and goals can connect 
with each other. In addition, there will be vendor demos and exhibits as 
well as noncommercial exhibits. Preconference workshops will be held 
on June 5. 

For more information, contact Doris K. Lidtke, NECC-83 General 
Chairman, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Tow- 
son State University, Baltimore, MD 21204. 

The University of Wisconsin at Madison's Center for Education Re- 
search is holding its third annual Microcomputers in Education confer- 
ence on Saturday, June 18, from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on the campus. 
Keynote speaker Nancy Grimes will talk about the development and im- 
plementation of a computer-literacy program in grades 3 through 9 in 
Wisconsin's Apple Valley/ Rosemount School District, and other educa- 
tors who use computers will also be giving presentations. 

To leam more, contact the Wisconsin Center for Education Re- 
search, 1025 West Johnson Street, Madison, WI 53706. 

New York City's Sheraton Centre will be the site of a one-day semi- 
nar for educators and administrators sponsored by CW Communica- 
tions on Saturday, June 25. The Microcomputers in Education seminar 
is part of a three-day event, the Executive Miaocomputer Conference 
and Exposition. Dr. Sylvia Charp, editor-in-chief of T.H.E. Journal and 
director of instructional systems for the Philadelphia Public School Sys- 
tem, is Saturday's keynote speaker. In addition to Dr. Charp's presenta- 
tion on the role of computers in education, there will be sessions on com- 
puter funding and acquisition, Logo, teacher training, administrative ap-

Necessary Direction for Computer Education: Navigational Aids of 



the '80s is the theme of Computers in Education '83, a conference and 
summer institute hosted by the University Conference Center at Rutgers 
University in New Jersey. Both events will focus on the impact that 
microcomputers and other information technologies are having on 
education at all levels, and both are intended to benefit teachers and ad- 
ministrators; book, periodical, and software publishers; and others with 
an interest in the educational applications of computers. According to 
CE director Dr. Mitchell Batoff, CE '83, cosponsored by more than a 
dozen nonprofit professional associations, will provide attendees with 
opportunities "to meet with hundreds of other microcomputer users 
from all levels and disciplines in education . . . and to engage in free ex- 
change of ideas and experiences." 

The conference will be held June 27-29 and will feature nine key- 
note presentations, plus 150 special interest sessions and short reports 
from experts and grassroots representatives around the country. Also 
planned are showings of award-winning films on computers in educa- 
tion, a computer graphics theater, exhibits, and displays. 

The CE '83 summer institute, held June 20- July 15, will offer some 
forty professional development courses for educators and administra- 
tors working at the elementary through university levels. Most courses 
will offer extensive hands-on experience using a microcomputer, so en- 
rollment is limited. The sessions will run an average of three days and 
may be taken for continuing education or graduate aedit. They'll span a 
broad range of topics, including computer literacy, computer languages

EZ-LEDGER is the Ideal record keeping system for somebody running a small business 
out of their home. EZ-LEDGER uses the simplest form of bookkeeping possible. Single 
entry bookkeeping requires only posting transactions either under INCOME or EXPENSE. 
EZ-LEDGER will keep track of expense items under any one of 99 user selected tax codes 
plus keeping all year-to-date and monthly running totals for each of the selected items. 
Expense items may be entered under DEDUCTIBLE or NONDEDUCTIBLE type codes. EZ- 
LEDGER is a strictly cash system i.e. if you pay out monies (check, cash, credit cards, 
etc.) then the transaction is posted under EXPENSE and if you receive monies then 
record them under INCOME. EZ-LEDGER will produce INVOICES with an automatically 
incremented Invoice number and then automatically post the data to an ACCOUNTS 
RECEIVABLE 'holding' file or directly to INCOME and update all totals. The accounts 
receivable and accounts payable files are 'holding' files with their own running year-to- 
date totals. Transactions In these files may be automatically posted to INCOME or 
EXPENSE and all respective totals will be updated automatically. EZ-LEDGER will sup- 
port 80 or 132 column printers and one or two disk drives. The printer is needed for 
producing invoices, but optional on all other reports EZ-LEDGER requires 48K RAM, 

APPLESOFT ROM and DOS 3,3 $60.00 

EZ-INVOICE 1.0 will allow you to generate invoices and then save them to disk. You may 
then recall the Invoices and print them or fully edit them. The great thing about EZ- 
INVOICE IS that everything on the invoices is user designed. The lines of dashes, the 
centering of headers, even which line the header (If any) Is to go on. The really exciting 
feature about EZ-INVOICE is the editing features. W/hen you recall an invoice/statement 
from your invoice-data disk you will be able to edit any of the Items on the Invoice and 
then print it or save it. You will be able to delete Items, revise items and add items. 

EZ-INVOICE also has a keyboard Macro feature. What this means is that you can build 
a name and address file or an items and prices file and then call the entire record into 
your invoice by entering a user defined three character code, what could be easier!

The International Institutie on Microcomputers in Education is slated 
for June 27— July 29 at Stanford University. Cosponsored by Stanford's 
School of Education and Interactive Sciences, a nonprofit corporation 
based in Palo Alto, California, the institute is intended to prepare edu- 
cators, researchers, and administrators to become computer-resource 
people for their districts and home schools. During the five-week pro- 
gram, educators will develop key computer-using skills and acquire a 
background that will help them establish computer centers in their home 
school systems. Offered concurrently with the institute will be a comput- 
er camp for young people ages eleven to seventeen. 

Interactive Sciences has been developing and refining effective ways 
of teaching computer literacy to both children and adults for several 
years. One particularly significant result of their work is the highly suc- 
cessful Computer Tutor method. At this summer's institute, modeled on 
an institute and computer camp held by Interactive Sciences and Stan- 
ford last year, computer-literate young people wall introduce educators to 
computers, and educators will in turn teach young computer campers 
how to use computers. 

By means of the computer tutor method, participating educators will 
get lots of hands-on experience with Apples and other microcomputers. 
They'll learn elementary Basic programming, word processing, database 
management, and spreadsheet analysis. Through "cross tutoring" (tu- 
toring and learning from other participants) they'll gain and reinforce 
skills, and learn to teach those same skills to another person. They'll also 
go on field trips, attend demonstrations of computer equipment, and 
hear guest speakers and panels of experts discuss computer-related 
topics. 

Interactive Sciences is committed to bringing the power of computer 
technology to as broad a range of people as possible. In keeping with this 
philosophy, no prior computer background or mathematical ability is as- 
sumed, and a special effort is made to ensure that people who are some- 
times excluded from such opportunities (such as girls and women, senior 
citizens, and the disabled) are included in the program.

Troll's Tale. By Sunnyside Soft. In a story as simple as a fairy tale, as 
serene in its fantasy as a sunlit summer lake, events need not happen in a 
hard and fast order. As long as all the things happen at one time or an- 
other to get the main character to the happy ending, everything's fine. 

What an ideal vehicle, then, for an interactive computer story for 
small children. With their second offering in just this vein, Sunnyside 
Soft proves it works. 

In form, Troll's Tale is an introductory adventure, as was its pred- 
ecessor, Dragon's Keep. Instead of typing in commands, the player 
chooses one of several commands listed on the screen. Press the space 
bar to move the command you want; press return to tell the Apple you 
want it. 

But, truly, Troll's Tale is an interactive story. The player, who is the 
protagonist, learns right away that the quest is to find and return the lost 
treasures of King Mark, treasures hidden and guarded by a pesky troll. 
The player determines the route to travel through the game; it doesn't 
matter — in the end, players must touch all the rooms and time is not im- 
portant. Fun is. 

All the treasures recovered, the player has a lovely surprise in store. 
Let's just say it's the perfect fairy-tale ending to this story. Children will 
be surprised and delighted. And they'll feel they're responsible for it, that 



MAY 1983 



they caused this lovely ending to happen. 

The graphics aren't the greatest but it doesn't matter; they're sunny 
and bright and clear. What they lack in polish is more than compensated 
for by the adventure itself and delightful touches in the text. For exam- 
ple, when you're in a well, something falls in the water and makes a 
splash; one of the options is to see the splash again. No tricks; it's a neat 
splash. Another time, you have a chance to check out a bottle in the 
troll's room. Poison? No way; just something yummy. 

Other messages contain little lessons and encourage kids to feel good 
about themselves and to be curious about the rest of this unique world. 

Sunnyside Soft earns its name. Troll's Tale is a totally delightful ex- 
perience for young children, one from which they'll learn many good 
things about thinking and feeling. 

Troll's Tale, by Sunyside Soft, Sierra On-Line (Sierra On-Line Building, Coarse- 
gold, CA 93614; 209-683-6858). $29.95. 

Alphabet Beasts & Co. By Classic Family Software. Alphabet Beasts & 
Co. is a well-executed number and letter recognition program for kids 
ages three and up. It combines sound learning theory, neat, imaginative 
graphics, discriminating use of color and sound, and touches of humor 
into a most satisfying and educational whole. 

Program operation is very simple, involving single keystrokes and the 
use of the space bar and return key. It's impossible to do anything 
"wrong" here; pressing any number or letter key or the space bar has an 
entertaining result; hitting any other key has no effect. 

To see a letter on-screen, the child simply hits that letter key. A pic- 
ture of a child and an appropriate mythological or fantasy creature then 
appears, accompanied by a pleasing rhyme for parents or siblings to read 
aloud that repeatedly uses the sound of the letter chosen. Hitting the 
same letter key again causes the letter to be printed on-screen by the 
"magic pencil." This representation of the letter matches the Zaner-Blos- 
er alphabet model — ^the method most often taught in elementary schools. 
Hitting some other letter instead produces the picture and rhyme for it. 

To see numbers, the child presses the number keys. Doing this acti- 
vates a nifty animated sequence: A seemingly blank picture frame ap- 
pears, and then the magic pencil prints out the spelling of the number. 
When the number key is pressed again, the numeral itself is printed by 
the pencil. (Hitting a different number or a letter begins the sequence ap- 
propriate to that entry.) Next, a little dragon dances onto the screen. 
When the dragon breathes on the picture frame, a portrait of another 
dragon gradually comes into view, this one in the shape of the number 
being displayed. To complete the sequence, more dragons (the correct 
number) bounce onto the screen, accompanied by a corresponding num- 
ber of notes of the musical scale. 

Alphabet Beasts & Co. contains a fun bonus feature — a Creature 
Feature, activated by hitting the return key in response to the title page 
(instead of a number or letter key) or by hitting the return key or the 
space bar at various other points in the program. This is a mix-and- 
match sequence in which children can mix up the heads, bodies, and legs 
of four creatures — a dragon, an alien, a genie, and a boy. The completed 
creature is then transported to a new setting. 

Because the program's creators "know from personal experience that 
kids and copy protection don't go together," Alphabet Beasts & Co. is un- 
protected; this facilitates the making of a backup. In addition, a sound- 
off option has been incorporated so that kids can play quietly when 
necessary. 

This program operates effectively on several levels. Its animation, 
sound effects, and ease of use make it ideal for young children to play 
with on their own, while its mythological verses and characters encour- 
age family participation and ongoing enjoyment.

Spelling Bee Games. By John Conrad. This program consists of four 
games intended to reinforce the spelling and reading skills of children 
ages four through seven. In the process, hand-eye coordination and the 
ability to memorize are also called into play. The word lists used in the 
games are the same as those used in Spelling Bee and Reading Primer, 
Edu-Ware's original education system. 

In Squadron, players are shown words and pictures and must match 
them up. This is done by guiding a game-paddle-controlled airplane into 
the correct position and zapping the word that corresponds to the pic-

ross Clues: 
The unique word 
challenge game. 

It offers intellectual stimulation arcade games can't 
match . . . with all the excitement. 

Fast-action fun isn't just for mysteiy or arcade games any 
more. Cross Clues is a word game that tests more than 
mere reflexes. It's the mind-challenging evolution of the 
crossword puzzle, with beat-the-clock excitement. The 
playing tempo is lively, but you decide how fast you want 
to go. The computer "umpires" while you compete with 
another player for hidden words, coaxing clues from the 
computer. Since a clue helps your opponent too, suspense 
builds till the end, when the best combination of skill, 
intellect, timing and luck wins. 

If you're ready lor an even greater challenge, try 
Concentration Crosswords™ a game that offers 3 levels 
of difficulty and 3 ways to play — lor even the most 
demanding word whiz. Again, you compete against the 
clock to uncover hidden words. But once discovered, they 
disappear, to test your memory. Here, a combination of 
word skills, intellect, memory and luck determine the 
winner. 

Both games olfer 50 mind-boggling puzzles that appeal 
to young teens through adults. T17 them both! You may 
find you've matched wits with monsters and space critters 
long enough.

ture by hitting the paddle button. A single player may compete against 
himself, or two players may compete against each other. 

Skyhook may be played by a single player or by as many as four 
players at a time. This game also involves associating a word with the 
correct picture. Here, however, a helicopter is part of the action. Players 
must assemble the word that goes with the displayed picture by choos- 
ing the appropriate letters from a truckload of letters provided at the bot- 
tom of the screen. Then they must hook each letter individually, maneu- 
vering the helicopter by means of the game paddles and flying the letter 
to the correct location in another part of the screen and then releasing it. 
The player gets a point for each letter correctly placed; incorrectly placed 
letters simply return to the truck to be used later on. 

Puzzle is a memorization exercise for one to four players that also in- 
volves making word/picture connections. Six squares, each containing a 
picture, are displayed on-screen for about six seconds. Then they are ob- 
scured by a numbered screen or door. Players get points by remember- 
ing what and where the objects are when a word corresponding to one of 
the hidden objects is shown on the screen. When an incorrect guess is 
made, the object that is actually contained in the box that was guessed is 
displayed for several seconds. This adds playing value to the game, since 
it has the effect of giving information to all the players that may cost or 
benefit them later in the round. 

In Convoy, a game for from one to four players, each player has a 
truck with his or her name on it. The object of the game is to type in the 
letters of the word that corresponds to a picture. Players take turns enter- 
ing letters, and when a correct letter is entered, the truck of the player 
who chose it moves part way across the screen. When a player's truck 
makes it all the way across the screen, a point is earned. 

Spelling Bee Games is not a terribly flashy program, but it's well done 
and offers young learners a nice variety of enjoyable gamelike ways to 
exercise their spelling and reading skills. It also gives them valuable, 
unintimidating experience using the computer. 

An easy-to-use configuration program contained on disk allows par- 
ents and teachers to set up the program for particular players and to test 
the game paddles to be sure they are functioning properly. From this 
menu, which is hidden from players' view, adults can also choose which 



MAY 1983 



units will be drawn from in a particular game session; there are twenty- 
two in all, ensuring that players will have plenty of new territory to move 
on to when they're ready.

Stickybear Numbers. By Richard Hefter and Janie and Steve Worth- 
ington. Stickybear ABC. By Richard Hefter and Jack Rice. Stickybear 
Bop. By Richard Hefter, Janie and Steve Worthington, and Spencer 
Howe. Big, shiny, brightly colored book covers with a whole bunch of 
goodies inside — what better way to capture the attention of the little 
ones? How about adding a big, cuddly, funny old bear and giving him a 
nice wife bear to join in the fun? Now let the bears run rampant through 
all the good stuff and . . . you've got the kid-pleasing computer packages 
from Xerox. Xerox? Yup, Xerox. (No, they're not copyable.) 

Everything about the Stickybear series and product sticks to the 
theme. Every detail counts and is executed with quality in mind. 

The bunch of goodies consists of bright, uncommercial-looking post- 
ers, sheets of sticky (stick-on) Stickybear stickers, a full-size high-quality 
hard-cover picture book or, in Bop, a heavy cardboard punchout and 
stand-up Stickybear toss game with lots of tossing pieces. 

All this is for the preschool-through-kindergarten crowd. Put the 
child at the keyboard — please with a color monitor or television — boot 
up a Stickybear disk, and enjoy your favorite novel. If you can quit 
watching. 

Numbers teadies the numbers zero through nine. When the child hits 
a number, that many somethings come up on the screen in some setting. 
Let's hit seven; seven plump, spinning spaceships rocket into formation 
over a moonscape. Hit seven again; seven arrows thwup into a target one 
after the other. Hit it again and seven penguins cavort on an Antarctic 
iceberg. One more time and seven trains chug into place, smokestacks 
puffing. There are many more alternatives than there are numbers, and 
sometimes they come up on different backgrounds as well. 

Stickybear is there: Stickybears in the windows of a building; Sticky- 
bear downing ice cream sundaes; Stickybear bedazzled by bouncing 
baUs. 

In ABC, each letter evokes one of two alternative words and pictures

illustrating them. It's a lovely touch that not all the words are objects 
you'd expect. For example, C (for cry) brings a Stickybear with big tears 
plopping from his eyes; K means kiss, and there's Stickybear and Mrs. 
Stickybear stealing a kiss. 

The graphics are an utter delight. Big, fat, crayon-style pictures done 
in fine detail in hi-res that's still wondering where it got all those pure, 
bright colors. Everything has animation — real animation, not Hanna- 
Barbera style; when the bird's wings flap, his legs and body respond. 
Some are simpler but fun, chosen for the occasion, not for the ease of 
execution — for instance, Q, for quilt, evokes a picture of Stickybear in 
bed, just his nose showing under a mountainous quilt, with a part of the 
quilt moving up and down as he breathes. 

Sound has not been forgotten, and its use is thoughtful. No sound 
occurs when snow (S) falls in the Arctic; but dancing hats (H) play a lit- 
tle tune, as do happy snowmen. Ducks quack, trains chug, motors putt- 
putt, rain pings. 

Stickybear Bop is a break in the action for action, and it'll appeal to 
older brothers and sisters, too. (Maybe even moms and pops and teach- 
ers. . . .) It's a game using the Stickybears and the same graphics and ani- 
mation, a shooting arcade that uses pinballs to go after moving objects. 
The bottom level is unmissable, the top a challenge. Six stages follow 
completion of the first level; progressing through levels depends on how 
many objects are hit, not on score. The goals and requirements get hard- 
er as the levels progress. 

If it continues to publish educational software as carefully made and 
as delightful as these Stickybear products, Xerox could have on its hands 
the Golden Books of computerdom.

Earl's Word Power. By George Earl. They sound alike, are often spelled 
alike, but have different meanings. Quick, what are those confusing acci- 
dents of language called? That's right, they're homonyms — words such 
as bark, pool, hear and here, there, their, and they're — and they can 
cause a person who's just learning them endless frustration. So can other 
words similar in sound or spelling, such as quit, quiet, and quite; since, 
sense, and cents. 

Subtitled "Horrible Homonyms," Earl's Word Power focuses on 
these problem-causers in an entertaining way. There's no need for docu- 
mentation explaining how to use the program; simple screen directions 
(such as "press return") tell users all they need to know. In addition, nice- 
size hi-res letters make both the instructions and the exercises easier to 
read. 

Homonyms are introduced two or three at a time. Each sound-alike 
word is defined and used correctly in a sentence. With this information in 
mind, the learner is ready to begin choosing the correct words to fill in 
the blanks in the sentences that follow. This is done by pressing a single 
key rather than spelling out the entire word. 

When an incorrect choice is made, learners aren't told that the an- 
swer is wrong, only to try again. The incorrect answer then disappears 
from the screen, narrowing down the choices. When the correct word has 
been chosen, the differences in meaning and spelling are reiterated and 
the sentence is presented again. 

In Earis Word Power, learning when to use which sound-alike word 
is seen as preparation, as a "dress rehearsal" of sorts. Three reinforce- 
ment exercises — titled Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, and Macbeth and 
loosely (very loosely) based on the plots of the Shakespeare plays of the 
same names — give learners the chance to perform, to use their new 
knowledge. Their task is to fill in the blanks in a long series of sentences 
that retell the famous stories. This helps ensure that they know how 
words are used in context and provides a fun way for kids to consolidate 
what they've learned.

Free Enterprise 

A business management game 

You run your own company making decisions based 
on economic factors and the actions of competitors. 

It's your opportunity to sit on top and run a corporation. 
Free Enterprise, based on an IBM-developed simulation 
for training top-level managers, is as surprising and 
demanding as the real world. 

It lets you face the same on-your-toes challenges you 
would in running a real business: pricing products, 
determining budgets for advertising, production, plant 
improvement, and R&D. Even securing bank loans and 
deciding on stockholder dividends. You use computer 
generated reports to make decisions. But if you're wrong 
you could go bankrupt. Only the shrewd survive! 

Free Enterprise can be played at three competency levels 
so novices can compete with the more experienced, and 
from one to six can play. It's the perfect chance to learn 
about the free enterprise system — to practice business 
strategies — and to enjoy it — with no risks. 

Simulation components: disk, user's manual, pad of 50 
record sheets, and pad of 50 decision sheets. 

To obtain Free Enterprise, see your local dealer or 
send in the order form below.

□ ComputerLand (Hayward, CA) will open 
"satellite" computer stores throughout the Bul- 
lock's department store chain in California, Las 
Vegas, and Phoenix. The satellites will always 
be located in towns that have ComputerLand 
service centers for after-sale support. "It's a 
good match," said ComputerLand vice presi- 
dent of development Ken Waters. "For Bul- 
lock's it solves the problem of carrying popular 
but very complicated technology products; to 
ComputerLand, Bullock's offers a large, high- 
quality clientele. I think we'll do well together." 

□ Marcia Klein has been named president of 
The Learning Company (Portola Valley, CA),

val, Quebec), a major Canadian distributor. 
"We have the utmost confidence that T.C. Da- 
ta Limited will provide outstanding Canadian 
service to our Canadian dealers," said Silicon 
Valley president Nathan Schulhof. "They'll be 
like an extension of our firm." Adding that "we 
feel strongly that training tomorrow's leaders 
adds to our corporate strength," Schulhof also 
announced that his company is donating 
$30,000 worth of software to the Canadian

by Apple will distribute Northwest's Apple- 
compatible instruments in West Germany, 
France, and the United Kingdom. "The evolu- 
tion of the personal computer into the technical 
community has happened faster in Europe than 
in the United States," says Apple Eurof)ean 
marketing manager Phil Roybal. "This was the 
impetus for our marketing agreement with 
Northwest Instruments. According to our re- 
search, we currently have the largest installed 
base of personal computers in technical mar- 
kets." Dealers are now being selected and 
trained for the European technical market. The 
first Northwest product to be distributed by 
Apple will be the Model 85 aScope Digital 



Memory Oscilloscope.

teractive text adventures, has beefed up its re- 
search and development capabilities with the in- 
stallation of a thirty-six-bit DECSystem 20/60 
computer, the largest mainframe manufactured 
by Digital Equipment Corporation. Of the half- 
million-dollar machine, president Joel Berez 
says, "When perfecting our skills at the Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology, we learned 
that the most cost-effective element in product 
development is optimum programmer produc- 
tivity, not hardware; even though this machine 
is very expensive, in the long run we feel it will 
be a much more economical method of de- 
veloping product software than using target 
machines."

PROFESSIONAL MUSIC 
SYSTEMS ON THE APPLE 

by Tom my Gear 




Art and technology meet in the person of the artist, who feels con- 
stantly compelled to find a better or more challenging means of expres- 
sion. For the artist who has chosen a medium as evanescent as the very air 
we breathe — the musician — this is especially true. The movement of a 
column of breath in a metal pipe, the flex of a string — these are simple 
techniques for producing vibrations in the air, which we f)erceive as 
sounds. Such techniques, once developed and refined, make possible the 
creation of sounds that act as bearers of complex meanings and power- 
ful emotions. The many instruments of the symphony orchestra reflect 
the variety of methods that have evolved to achieve this. The advent of 
electronics now offers twentieth-century musicians a new medium with which 
to produce sound, as well as a new means by which to understand it. 

Using electricity, sounds can be produced through circuits called os- 
cillators. The electrical signals oscillators produce become audible only 
after they are processed by an amplifier and sent to a speaker, which 
produces the vibrations in the air we call sounds. Before that point is 
reached, though, signals can be manipulated using electrical voltages and 
circuits, called control voltages and filters; this process is called subtrac- 
tive sound synthesis. A speaker's output and a sound's timbre are ulti- 
mately determined by manipulations such as these. 

The Sound of Electronic Music. A sound can be described by graph- 
ing the way it makes the air move. The line on such a graph would be in 



the shape of a wave. One simple waveform that's produced by an elec- 
tronic oscillator is called a sine wave. Though a sine wave can describe 
any pitch, it is characterized by an almost sterile purity of tone. More 
complex waveforms can be created by combining sine waves and other 
simple waves together. This produces more interesting sounds. 

Producing sounds by adding waveforms together is called additive 
sound synthesis. A sound generated in this way would consist of a fun- 
damental wave that determines its audible pitch, and a variable number 
of barely audible overtone pitches, called harmonics. Each unique sound 
contains a different number of harmonics in varying strengths. This 
strength is measured in amplitude, which reflects the change in air pres- 
sure caused by the presence of different harmonics. 

Another important way to describe a sound indicates how it begins, 
sustains itself, and ends. The amplitude changes that this process reflects 
can also be graphed — the result is called a sound's envelope. Along with 
this, a given sound's unique waveform and harmonic spectrum deter- 
mine its timbre, or characteristic sound. These are the qualities that dis- 
tinguish the sound of a horn from that of a piano. 

Sound synthesis is the aeation of sounds by electronically con- 
trolling all the parameters that define them. Using voltage control to vary 
parameter settings over a range is called analog synthesis, because the 
voltages represent (or are analogs to) the parameters being controlled. 



Digital techniques and circuitry can also be used to produce and control 
sounds, and this is called digital synthesis. To be able to hear sound pro- 
duced digitally, it's necessary to convert the digital information into ana- 
log information, which can then be amplified and played on a speaker. 
This translation is done with a digital-to-analog converter. 

Applying a computer to the creation of sounds and music digitally or 
as a controller of analog synthesizers coheres the ongoing struggle by 
musical artists to come to terms with technology and use it as a means of 
expression. This brief overview gives an idea of the type of knowledge re- 
quired of musicians who choose to pursue the digital muse. 

We'll look at the professional systems currently available to produce 
music with your Apple. Each works in a distinctive way. Three of the 
systems use the Apple directly to generate sounds. The others harness 
various analog synthesizers to the Apple, delegating to it the responsibil- 
ity of master controller. 

Mountain Music Madness. The core of the Mountain Music Sys- 
tem consists of two connected hardware boards that must be inserted in- 
to consecutive slots of the Apple. Attached to them is an audio output 
jack through which the system is connected to a mixer or stereo via a 
standard dual RCA audio cable. A light pen (attached to an imprac- 
tically short cord) is also provided. The system was designed to accept 
commands from the Apple keyboard, a set of paddles, and the light pen.

Certain command options are available through only one of these 

means. 

The sounds themselves are generated by sixteen independent user- 
programmable digital oscillators. A waveform table of 256 bytes is used 
to store the data for the periodic waveforms generated by an oscillator. 
When the waveform tables are residing in the Apple's memory, each os- 
cillator needs to read a new entry from its waveform table every thirty- 
two microseconds. 

The digital data is made audible using eight-bit digital-to-analog con- 
verters. The oscillators are grouped into two clusters of eight. The even- 
numbered oscillators are assigned to the left stereo channel, the odd- 
numbered ones to the right channel. The outputs of each cluster are com- 
bined to form a complex waveform. The Passport Soundchaser and the 
alphaSyntauri keyboards are both designed around the Mountain hard- 
ware. Each system provides you with a unique software package, 
however. 

Let's take a look at the menu of the first of the two disks provided, 
the System 1 software. Its three programs are Music Player, Music Edi- 
tor, and Music Merger. 

Music Player allows you to play songs that have been stored on the 
flip side of the System 1 disk as song files. When a song file is loaded, the

screen displays the song title and a description of some parameters that 
comprise the song, such as the number of instrumental parts, their 
names, and how the individual parts have been assigned between the left 
and right stereo speakers. You can alter the speaker assignment, set the 
entire output to mono, or change the arrangement of instrumental 
sounds that are playing the various parts in the composition. The song 
plays with all the parameters you've chosen. It isn't possible to play a 
piece of music in real time with the Mountain software. Only music load- 
ed from a song file can be played. 

The creation of song files and the modification of existing files is 
done with the Music Editor. The Music Editor also enables you to dis- 
play and print musical scores and to load and save compositions. 

In the top half of the Music Editor's hi-res screen is a musical staff on 
which notes are displayed as they are input. The bottom half of the 
screen consists of the Music Editor's main command menu and a status 
line. Using the light pen or one of the paddles, you can make choices 
about the duration of individual chords, notes, and rests, measure place- 
ment, and accidentals. You can also change pitches, delete segments, or 
scroll to other parts of the piece. 

The status line at the bottom of the screen indicates the current con- 
dition of some important aspects of a composition. It tells you the part or 
voice of the composition that you're currently working on (the saeen can 
only display the notation of one voice at a time), the measure number 
you're on, and the current octave you're working in (there are eight func- 
tional octaves; the screen can display only four at a time). 

Before entering any notes, you have to make some decisions about 
what you want to compose. This means specifying the clef, time, and key 
of the composition from the signature commands menu, accessible from 
the Editor's main command menu. Once this is done, you can place in- 
dividual notes or chords on the hi-res staff using a paddle in conjunction

with the main commands menu. No music keyboard peripheral is in- 
cluded with the Mountain software package. 

Two additional sections give you greater control of refinements. With 
the sound control menu, you control variations in overall dynamics 
(graded from pianissimo to fortissimo), tempo (from lentissimo to 
presto), and spatial location (determining from which stereo speaker the 
sound output of a given part of the composition will emanate). With the 
note modifier menu, you can choose note and chord dynamic accents 
and create ties between notes of different durations. 

When you've finished entering the musical information that com- 
prises the current composition, you can hear it by saving it to the song 
files disk and then reloading it. Some disk swapping is required here if 
you have one drive. Using the Music Merger program, you can combine 
many composition files together into one composition. 

The second disk provided by Mountain is System 2, the Instrument 
Definer. This disk contains the software for creating sounds by means of 
additive synthesis techniques. On its flip side is a collection of twenty or 
so predefined instrumental sounds, called presets, that have been synthe- 
sized for you. They serve as a good starting place to apply the sound 
analysis capabilities of the System 2 disk. 

In creating or analyzing a sound, the Mountain system allows for the 
manipulation of a number of disaete parameters. If any of these param- 
eters is altered, the sound they describe will change. 

Any given sound, instrumental or otherwise, can be graphically rep- 
resented as a waveform. The System 2 disk makes it possible to plot 
waveforms and to combine up to sixteen different ones in varying de- 
grees of intensity in molding a desired sound. 

Recall that each waveform consists of a fundamental frequency and a 
series of harmonics. You are provided with a bar graph on which to plot 
waveforms to the twenty-third harmonic, each harmonic in amplitude 
increments of one hundred units. The overall amplitude and frequency 
modulation of a sound, as well as its envelope, are essential parameters 
determining its distinctive quality, or timbre. AU these aspects of sound

synthesis can be controlled and graphically scrutinized using the System 
2 disk. 

The system is built around sixteen oscillators for generating sounds, 
but some sounds may use more than one oscillator to achieve their tim- 
bre. This implies a lessened note capacity for the piece in which such 
sounds are used. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that this is a sixteen- 
voice system. It is left to the user to keep track of the allocation of the os- 
cillators when composing; otherwise problems become apparent only 
later when you attempt to play the piece. 

The Mountain Music System relies exclusively upon standard music 
notation for generating compositions. When you're trying to harness the 
computer's power in developing musical ideas, the limitations imposed 
by standard notation can be stultifying. In addition to this, certain quirks 
exist even in the way this standard approach is handled. Adjacent flagged 
notes (such as eighths and sixteenths) won't be connected the way they 
should be to conform to standard practice, which makes for difficult 
reading on the staff. Tempo markings are restricted to being the same 
aCTOSS the instrumental voices in a given piece; therefore, polyrhythms 
(overiapping rhythms of different tempos) and other inventive arrange- 
ments are ruled out. Also, all the accidentals in a composition will be in- 
dicated as either all sharps or all flats, depending on the key signature. 

The use of the classic terminology to indicate dynamics is question- 
able when the computer could control these parameters more specifical- 
ly if given a range of numeric inputs. It is simply not possible to adiieve 
any subtlety of musical phrasing given the approach taken in the Music 
Editor software. A most annoying aspect of using the system is the long 
waiting time that often occurs when the program needs to get something 
from the disk. 

The manual, which presents an excellent step-by-step explanation of 
how to use the system, is appropriate for use by someone new to the con- 
cepts of sound synthesis. Reference sections are offered as an aid to those 
who want to explore these topics more deeply. 

In the process of developing a sound, the System 2 software gives 
you constant audio feedback, so you can hear any changes as you're 
making them. If you happen to make a mistake as you're learning how 
to use the system, helpful prompts indicate the error of your ways and try 
to steer you aright. 

Passport to Music. The Passport Soundchaser Computer Music Sys- 
tem from Passport Designs uses the Mountain Computo- hardware with 
software specially developed for the Soundchaser. In addition, Passport 
provides a four-octave, organ-type keyboard connected to an interface 
card that goes into the Apple's slot 7. Music education software that 
works with the system is available, as are program packages for tran- 
scribing notes played on the keyboard, for alternate keyboard tunings, 
and for combining pieces in record album form onto a single disk. 

The Passport software is fast, versatile, and easy to use. The few 
global similarities it shares with the Mountain software result from the 
fact that both systems are constructed around the same hardware base. 
In addition to the eight-track digital performance software already avail- 
able for the Soundchaser, Passport has recently released Turbo-Traks. 

With the Mountain hardware, Turbo-Traks provides a sixteen-oscil- 
lator, digitally programmable synthesizer and sequencer with real-time 
access to sixteen preset programmable sounds, individually playable on 
the Soundchaser polyphonic keyboard. Sounds may be created through 
additive synthesis, then stored to disk as presets. In addition, 112 presets 
are provided on disk as part of the system. The Turbo-Traks sequencer 
operates much like a sixteen-track tape recorder. It will store a passage as 
you play it on the keyboard; then you can listen to it and play along, with 
the sequencer continually storing each consecutive overdub. 

The program to accomplish all this resides on a single unprotected 
disk. Consequently you can work comfortably with only one disk drive. 
Both the Apple and paddles are used in interacting with the system. You 
can use a joystick, but avoid the self-centering kind — otherwise, prob- 
lems of pitch control will arise. 

Upon booting Turbo-Traks, you're presented with the cryptic-look- 
ing preset screen. This screen contains collective and individual informa- 
tion about the sixteen presets that are automatically loaded when you 
boot the system. You can now choose any one of these presets and play it

on the Soundchaser keyboard. You can even split the keyboard at any 
point and assign a different preset to each segment. Enabling the paddle 
potentiometer for pitch bend is possible from the preset screen, as is set- 
ting the control for the overall output volume. 

To understand better how Turbo-Traks is structured, a little more de- 
tail on the way the Mountain hardware boards operate is in order. As 
you'll recall, this hardware provides a total of sixteen oscillators to pro- 
duce sounds, divided between the left and right stereo output channels 
into two groups of eight. These are the physical oscillators, and they lim- 
it the number of sounds possible at a given moment to a maximum of 
sixteen. Although this seems like a reasonable number, recall that if you 
choose to combine them in order to construct more complex timbres, the 
number of individual notes you can play is consequently restricted. These 
sets of instructions in the software that we use to determine how the 
physical oscillators will sound (their timbres) can be considered logical 
oscillators. The more logical oscillators we call into play, the fewer the 
notes we will be able to play on the keyboard at one time. 

It would seem reasonable to assume, then, that when using only one 
logical oscillator it would be possible to play a total of sixteen notes si- 
multaneously on the keyboard. Unfortunately this is not so on the 
Soundchaser keyboard, and this limitation is due to the structure of the 



Mountain hardware boards. The logical oscillators of Turbo-Traks must 
follow the same division between channels into groups of eight as the 
hardware's physical oscillators. If we're utilizing only one logical oscilla- 
tor, it can only be assigned to either the left or the right channel. The re- 
sult is that the maximum keyboard polyphony possible with Turbo-Traks 
is sixteen voices, but only if you split the keyboard and assign a single left 
oscillator to one segment and a single right oscillator to the other. When 
not using this approach, the maximum polyphony possible is eight 
voices. 

The Turbo-Traks preset screen contains a matrix that graphically rep- 
resents how the sixteen oscillators are distributed among the sixteen pre- 
sets currently in memory. A simple command changes the sound of any 
preset by redistributing the oscillators. The change is immediately re- 
flected on the matrix and in the sound produced by the keyboard. 

The parameters that determine the sound produced by an oscillator 
may be varied for each of the sixteen oscillators. Modifying a parameter 
merely means changing the numeric value associated with it, and this 
change is audible in real time. The sound parameters controlled in this 
section of the program are pitch by octave, frequency modulation, and 
envelope shape. Alternate tunings for the Soundchaser keyboard can be 
created using a separate utility.

David Kusek thinks the sound of music is the new frontier in home 
computers. "Today's music is being generated on inexpensive equip- 
ment in people's homes," he says. "There's a whole new market opening 
up in computer music, and the personal computer is paving the way." 

Kusek and John Borowicz have been running Passport Designs out 
of Half Moon Bay, California, since 1980. They came to the computer 
music business via employment with Electronic Music Labs, one of the 
big three of the original synthesizer manufacturers, along with Arp and 
Moog. Following their stint with EML, they founded Star Instruments 
in Connecticut, currently one of the largest manufacturers of percussion 
synthesizers, where they developed the first computer-controlled instru- 
ment synthesizers. 

"We left Star Instruments to pursue our interests in the personal 
computer revolution and its effect on the music industry," says Kusek. 

Passport's central contribution to that industry is the Soundchaser 
computer music system. "The home organ of the future" was originally 
introduced for the Apple in an analog version with Notewriter, a pro- 
gram that allowed real-time music composition, and Musictutor, a com- 
puter-aided instruction package to develop listening skills and general 
music theory. 

The analog system did not do that well in the marketplace. Three 
years ago there wasn't that much of a marketplace, and the pricing of the 
system was not competitive with the standalone synthesizers. 

Passport introduced the Soundchaser Digital keyboard and per- 
formance software in November 1981. The four-octave keyboard comes 
with software for an eight-voice polyphonic synthesizer, allowing the 
creation of waveform programs, defining instruments, plus four-track 
sound-on-sound recording, looping, and real-time control of sound. Or- 
chestral arrangements can be stored and played back with a multitrack 
sequencer that records and layers the individual parts. 

The company's sales increased 258 percent in the six-month period 
following the introduction of the Soundchaser Digital, a growth aided by 
its marketing arrangement with Mountain Computer that allowed the 



packaging of Mountain's Music 
System synthesizer board with each 
Soundchaser system. 

"With Mountain Computer, we 
initiated what I believe to be the first 
co-op marketing campaign between 
two electronics manufacturers," 
says Kusek, "and the success has 
just begun to show. We have devel- 
oped a product that is higher quali- 
ty and lower priced than the com- 
petition and plan to expand our 
markets accordingly." 
Passport continues to aim at three markets — Apple computer users, 
performing musicians, and professional educators. It is focusing more on 
the home consumer market these days, developing more music instruc- 
tion programs, and looking into other computers. "Our forte is soft- 
ware," says vice president of marketing Chris Albano, "and that's what 
we're concentrating on." This is in line with David Kusek's policy of 
continually updating Soundchaser "to offer consumers the most power- 
ful, low-cost computer music system they can buy. The personal com- 
puter revolution is letting us put high-levd digital synthesis in the hands 
of people who could neither afford nor understand it a few years ago." 

Turbo-Traks was the third software package to join the Soundchaser 
library, incorporating user ideas and suggestions to create, in effect, a live 
performance synthesizer and sixteen-track recording studio. It simu- 
lates an analog tape deck in software, variable number of oscillators per 
voice, sync to tape or drum machine, and extended recording time. 
Soundchaser's latest offering, Kaleido^ound, is a real-time graphics pro- 
gram that synchronizes to any audio output to produce a four-color 
kaleidoscope on-screen, after the fashion of the color organs that were 
hot items in the psychedelic sixties. "It's actually quite mesmerizing," 
Kusek says of his company's first entertainment software product, "not 
like a game program Uiat you eventually master and get bored with." 

Even with the emphasis on home-synthesizing for the average user, 
Passport has helped out other people, too. The first customer to patron- 
ize the company on Half Moon Bay was Alan Greenwood, then key- 
board player with Foreigner. Brent Mydland of the Grateful Dead also 
gets a lot of use out of his Soundchaser, as do Roger Powell of Todd 
Rundgren's Utopia, Tom Chase, who scores the television series Fame 
and One Day at a Time, and Andy Musson, music director for Bette 
Midler and the Manhattan Transfer. 

The intrepid band of engineers and musicians who started the com- 
pany with Kusek and Borowicz are looking to make a big noise in the 
business, and the growing reputation of their computer music company 
is music to their ears.

Passport's Turbo-Traks displays information about the sixteen 
presets in the Apple's memory (left), and plots the waveforms you've 
created with the Wavemaker (right). 

With the Wavemaker, you can determine the shapes of the wave- 
forms for the oscillators that go into synthesizing the sixteen presets. You 
can create waveforms by specifying the relative amplitudes of the fimda- 
mental and fifteen harmonics in 255 increments on a bar graph. 

The Wavemaker also allows you to combine already created com- 
plex waves together to produce even more interesting sounds. Four low- 
frequency oscillators (in addition to the primary sixteen) can be used to 
control vibrato or phasing effects. Waveforms that you've created, or 
those that already exist as presets, can be plotted and altered. 

You can play musical passages in real time on the Soundchaser key- 
board at a chosen tempo, keeping your tempo by following a metronome 
click track. You can then play along with tracks you've laid down as 
they're playing back, simultaneously recording the track you're playing. 
In this way a maximum of sixteen separate, completely polyphonic, and 
simultaneously playing data tracks can be stored. Although you can re- 
cord only a single track at a time, each track has individual controls for 
volume and preset assignment. Preset assignments may be varied track 
by track after they're recorded, so you can try out alternatives to the ar- 



rangement you used when the piece was originally recorded. That's a fea- 
ture impossible to achieve on even the most advanced sixteen-track tape 
recorder. 

The restrictions imposed by the sixteen-oscillator limit also apply 
when using the sequencer. The sequencer has an approximate capacity of 
twenty-eight hundred notes with a 48K Apple, and about double that 
with 64K. Other features include being able to transpose the entire play- 
back up or down an octave with one keypress, and to loop the entire pas- 
sage for continuous playback. The Turbo-Traks sequencer does not al- 
low you at any point to enter into a track to change one part of it or to 
fix a mistake that may have occurred when you recorded the track. The 
only altemative in this case is to re-record the entire track and hope you 
get it right this time. 

By being aware of them, a user can avoid the couple of small pitfalls 
the program can present. For example, going directly to the Wavemaker 
section of the program automatically wases any information contained 
in the sequencer's recording buffer. Remembering to merge all recorded 
tracks before going from the sequencer to other parts of the program cir- 
cumvents this problem. Another thing to be aware of is how the pro- 
gram reacts if a language card is present. It automatically loads DOS on- 
to the card, thus freeing about IIK of lower RAM for use by the se- 
quencer. If you won't always be using the program on a 64K machine, 
this could cause problems. Sequencer files created on a 64K machine will 
load and play on a 48K Apple, but if you go to load or save something 
else you may obliterate the DOS files. To get around this you must re- 
member to press the space bar as the program boots; this causes the pro-

In part 1 of this article, we examined the text and lores-graphics 
modes of the Apple II. To continue our exploration of the Apple's video 
capabilities, let's look at the hi-res-graphics mode. In the course of our 
discussion, we'll discover why statements 2 and 3 from last time are false. 
Here are those two statements again, just in case you don't recall them 
right off. 

2. True or false? When two adjacent dots on the hi-res screen are 
"turned on," the complementary colors from each dot blend in the eye to 
form a white spot. 

3. Since the Apple's video signal is described as "NTSC-compat- 
ible," it should be possible to use the Apple with other video devices such 
as video-tape recorders, processing amplifiers, and so on. 

As we said last time, the same circuits that are used to create the text 
and lo-res-graphics modes on the Apple are also used, with a few 
changes, to generate hi-res-graphics displays (see figure 1). For hi-res 
graphics, the first change is in the RAM MUX (multiplexor) section, 
which is where the memory addresses for the visual display are created. 
When the hi-res mode is in use, this section causes the address range be- 
tween $2000 and $3FFF (or alternately $4000 through $5FFF) to be con- 
verted to video. This conversion is performed to create a "bit-mapped" 
image — that is, an image in which each bit corresponds to one picture 
element (pixel). Unfortunately, the bit-mapping is done in a rather com- 
plicated way. The figure on page 21 of the Apple II Reference Manual 
shows how the screen image is mapped into the Apple's memory. 

The next change takes place at the shift registers B4 and B9. Due to 
the connections made through A8, these two four-bit shift registers are 
cascaded to form one eight-bit device. The shift clock rate is reduced to 
one-half that used by the lo-res mode, and this sets the dot rate at 7 
MHz. The output of this dual-shift register leaves B4-15 (B4, pin 15) and 

RED = HI-RES 




@ O 



Figure 1. Schematic showing hi-res circuit path. 



goes to a flip-fiop at Al 1 that delays the bit stream by one-half cycle. 
This is the "color-shift-bit" delay, which is used to get the alternate col- 
ors in the hi-res mode. Both the direct and delayed signals are fed into the 
video selector switch, A9. One of these signals is then selected as the vid- 
eo source, depending on the high-order color shift bit (follow D7 around 
into A8-13, A 10-4, and finally into A9-11). 

The Apple's video output, therefore, is nothing more than a continu- 
ous stream of bits being read out from memory. Note, however, that for 
each byte, the bits are shifted out to the left, starting with the least signifi- 
cant bit, DO. That is, DO gets displayed first with Dl, D2, and so on fol- 
lowing to the right (remember the CRT scans from left to right). This is 
the reverse of the way binary data is usually written. 

Whenever the video bit stream is high, this appears on the monitor as 
white. A low video bit stream appears on the monitor as black. When the 
video signal alternates, however, something special happens. Because the 
dot rate is exactly twice that of the color subcarrier frequency, any tran- 
sitions appear to be chroma information. For example, if the entire 
screen memory is filled with zeros except for a single high bit, a color 
monitor displays this as a small colored dot. The exact color of the dot 
depends on two factors: the screen position and the color shift bit (CSB). 
On a properly adjusted monitor, single dots in the even columns appear 
as violet (CSB=0) or blue (CSB=1). Those in odd columns are green 
(CSB=0) or orange (CSB= 1). Since there's only one CSB for every sev- 
en bits, some color combinations can only alternate every seven dots. Al- 
so, because an odd number of dots is created from each byte in memory, 
a solid-colored object is represented in RAM by alternating byte 
patterns. 

Consider next the case of filling the screen with one solid color. For 
the entire screen to be one color, the CSB of each display byte must be 
the same. For a soHd color {as opposed to black or white), the remaining 
bits within each display byte alternate between 1 and 0. Again, to keep 
the output bit stream consistent, every other display byte starts with the 
opposite polarity (ignoring the CSB of course). Here is how this might 
look in memory: 

01010101 00101010 01010101.... 

or, if you wish, $55, $2A, $55, and so on. 

The boldface numbers represent the color-shift bits and the remain- 
ing bits are what get displayed. Thus, the video output stream from this 
setup would be 

1010101 0101010 1010101. ... 

or a continuously alternating pattern. 

Let's see what this means from the NTSC composite video signal 
standpoint. The video signal in this case resembles a 100 percent, or 100- 
unit, square wave at 3.58 MHz. This is interpreted by a color monitor as 
a color signal whose luminance level is 50 units (that is, gray). The 3.58 
MHz information is regarded as a highly saturated {100 percent) chroma 
signal whose phase represents the color violet. If the bit pattern had 
started with a 0 instead of a 1, then the phase would be shifted 180 de- 
grees to form green (see figure 2). At any point where the color shift bit 
goes high, the remaining seven dots within that byte get displayed using 
the alternate hi-res blue and orange. This is because the CSB causes an 
extra ninety-degree phase shift to be introduced into the video bit stream. 

Now to reveal why the second statement from last month is not the 
correct explanation of why a white spot is produced whenever two adja- 
cent dots are turned on. The true explanation becomes obvious when

you look at the video signal such a pair of Is produce. As the shift 
register clocks out the bits from memory, one high bit followed imme- 
diately by another causes the video signal to remain high for two con- 
secutive dot clocks. This means that there is no transition at the 3.58 
MHz color rate and therefore no chroma information for this portion of 
the video signal. Without any chroma information, the monitor simply 
treats the high video signal as a white area and displays it as such. There- 
fore, the fact that two adjacent dots produce a white spot has nothing to 
do with two complementary colored dots blending on-screen to form 
white (of course, any white spot is technically due to the mixture of light 
from the red, green, and the blue phosphors, but that's a different subject 
altogether). 

Monitors. There are several ways of displaying the Apple's video 
signal. One popular approach is to use an RF modulator with a stan- 
dard black-and-white or color television set. The modulator converts the 
video signal into a VHF (or sometimes UHF) channel that can be re- 
ceived directly by the television receiver. This offers the advantage of low 
cost, specially for color, assuming of course that you already have the 
television set. If the set is also used for normal tdevision viewing, an RF 
switch can be used to select either the Apple or regular antenna signals. 
Using a color television set as a monitor presents several disadvantages, 
however, aside from possible conflicts with broadcast television viewing. 
The major one is limited resolution or clarity of text display. For this 
reason, computers (including the Apple) designed to be used with televi- 
sion receivers limit the number of characters per line to forty or less. 
Most of the "fuzziness" observed on these sets is due to the limited band-

width of the receiver sections. 

Color television sets pose more serious threats to readability — dot 
size and misconvergence. Color picture tubes must use three different 
phosphors to produce the primaiy colors. These phosphors are laid down 
alternately on the face of the screen in very thin stripes or in triangular 
patterns called triads. The use of this process means that the minimum 
dot size and the spacing between dots is much larger than on similar 
monochrome CRTs. Convergence refers to how accurately the three sep- 
arate beams within a color picture tube track each other. Where the con- 
vergence is perfect, the red, green, and blue beams land on the same spot, 
creating a "pure" white spot. Any deviation from this condition causes 
colored halos or shadows to appear. 

A good-quality color monitor can be used to improve the quality of 
color displays. Eliminating the modulation and demodulation proc- 
esses can also eliminate much of this degradation. However, the limita- 
tions of dot size and convergence still exist. The Amdek Color I is a good 
example of an NTSC composite color video monitor. It has 260(H)-by- 
3(XXV) resolution and also contains a built-in speaker and audio ampli- 
fier. For higher-quality graphics, and even eighty-column displays, direa 
RGB video can be used; more on this later. 

For serious computer operation, a good monochrome monitor 
should be used. Several factors can reduce eye fatigue associated with 
prolonged computer use. Screen size, phosphor color, and video band- 
width should all be carefully weighed in terms of personal preferences, 
budget, and specific use. 

Most Apple owners choose either a nine-inch or twelve or thirteen- 
inch monitor to fit on top of the computer. The larger monitor is usually 
preferred because its larger characters are easier to read. This size moni- 
tor is also very good to have when you're going to be using an eighty-col- 
umn board. 

Many people find nine-inch monitors more convenient despite the 
smaller character size they provide (the characters a nine-inch monitor 
displays are still larger than the ones you get with a conventional thir- 
teen-inch eighty-column display). Most nine-inch units fit quite com- 
fortably along with two disk drives on top of the computer. They also of- 
fer a distinct advantage when portability is important. 

One of the biggest debates about monochrome monitors concerns 
what color is best. For a while, most computer displays used standard 
black-and-white television picture tubes. These CRTs have phosphors, 
technically referred to by the designation P4, that emit a white light. 
White light, of course, is just an equal distribution of all frequencies (or 
colors) of light. In actuality, however, this light appears more like a com- 
bination of blue and yellow light, which combine to form a white image. 
This would not be of any consequence were it not for some flaws in nor- 
mal human vision. 

The human eye exhibits an optical property known as chromatic 
aberration. This means that the eye focuses differently on different col- 
ors of light (see figure 3). This would seem to imply, however, that every- 
thing we see should be surrounded by color fringes. A hypothesis ex- 
plaining the lack of these fringes was published in 1939 by Gustavus Hart- 
ridge, who theorized that while yellow light focuses precisely on the 
retina, red and green focus slightly on either side. These out-of-focus

images cause sharp points of light to appear as larger "blurs"; the red 
and green blurs are about the same size, however, and thus tend to form 
a single, fuzzy, yellow spot. Therefore, while this chromatic aberration 
creates a decrease in visual acuity, it does not result in a color distortion. 
By the way, the blue end of the spectrum is not considered because it is 
so poorly focused. This causes its image to be relatively dispersed and per- 
haps even below the threshold of vision. 

From this discussion, it would appear that a yellow phosphor would 
make the ideal monitor. This also correlates well with the spectral sensi- 
tivity of the eye, as shown in figure 4. The peak of the curve in the yellow 
region shows that the eye is most sensitive to the color yellow. To verify 
this conclusion, several studies have been performed. One German group 
compared the performance of computer users working with green, yel- 
low, amber, and black-and-white screens. The results indicated that a yel- 
low screen with an amber filter resulted in performance figures more 
than four times higher than those obtained using a black-and-white 
screen. 

One of the few companies offering amber monitors in this country is 
USI International. Its Pi-3 (twelve inches) and Pi-4 (nine inches) are am- 
ber equivalents to its Pi-1 and Pi-2 green-screen monitors. These moni- 
tors also feature a video invert switch, which allows for either the tradi- 
tional amber letters on a black screen or black letters on a solid amber 
screen. The Pi-4 even has switchable DC restoration (to keep the bright- 
ness level constant regardless of what image is being displayed) and a vid- 
eo/data switch that increases the sharpness of characters when comput- 
er data is being viewed. 

Many companies now offer green-screen monitors that use the popu- 
lar P31 phosphor. Some monitors employ the P39, also a green phos- 
phor, but with a longer persistence. This reduces any flicker that might 
otherwise be noticed with our 60 Hz field rate. But flicker is rarely a 
problem anyway, and the longer persistence can sometimes cause blur- 
ring of fast-moving displays (such as program listings). 

RGB Color System. The NTSC composite video system was de- 
signed for simple transmission through coaxial cable or as a broadcast sig- 
nal. Therefore all of the information carried by this signal is packed to- 
gether as efficiently as possible. This is accomplished partly at the ex- 
pense of bandwidth (resolution) and certainly adds complexity, which in- 
evitably lowers the signal quality. 

Since most computer displays are located inside or within the im- 
mediate vicinity of the computer, the advantages of this system aren't as 
important. If the entire encoding/ decoding process could be elimi- 
nated — so that separate red, green, and blue signals were fed directly in- 
to the CRT — a display of much higher quality could be obtained. For 
one thing, colors would be much more vivid as a result of their increased 
purity and clarity. 

Top-of-the-line RGB monitors such as the Amdek Color IV make 
possible incredible color displays and crisp eighty-column text displays. 
This is because of the use of analog video circuitry and a CRT with ex- 
ceptionally fine dot structure.

Many computers, including the Apple III and the IBM pc, have cir- 
cuitry to drive an RGB monitor. Since the Apple II has no such provi- 
sion, a peripheral card is needed to generate the necessary signals. Am- 
dek manufactures such a board; it's called the DVM, or Digital Video 
Multiplexor. The present version of the board is rather complicated to 
install and offers only digital control of the three primary colors. These 
"channels" are controlled by several soft switches that can be turned on 
and off via simple poke statements. Two other switches select either the 
standard Apple text video or the output from another video device, such 
as an eighty-column board. Connection to an eighty-column board is al- 
so rather complicated, and detailed instructions are given only for the 
Videx Videoterm. People who own other eighty-column boards are on 
their own. 

The DVM board works by intercepting the graphics video data as it 
is read out from RAM. This is accomplished via connection to the data 
latch ICs B6 and B7, which are placed into a small daughterboard, or 
adapter socket. Another daughterboard is inserted at the video counters 
Dll through D14 to pick off the necessary timing signals. 

The DVM interprets the RAM data in a different way than do the 
Apple's graphics generating circuits. Instead of serializing the data to 
form a composite color signal, the DVM handles the data in four-bit (lo- 
res) or two-bit plus color shift bit (hi-res) parallel bundles. These groups 
of bits are then used to turn on the appropriate electron guns of the col- 
or CRT. The lo-res mode is limited to eight colors: black, red, green, yel- 
low, magenta, cyan, blue, and white. These are the only possible colors 
with digital RGB video; they represent all combinations of the three guns 
being on or off. In the hi-res mode, all of these colors except yellow and 
cyan are available. 

Amdek has announced the release of an improved version of the 
DVM. Called the DVM- II, this board features much simpler installa- 
tion, analog intensity control, and better compatibility with eighty-col- 
umn boards. 

For display, Amdek offers a choice of three RGB monitors: the Col- 
or II, Color III, and Color IV. The Color III monitor, which is the least 
expensive, offers 260-by-300 line resolution and should provide satisfac- 



J 97 

tory performance with eighty-column cards that use a 5-by-7 charac- 
ter matrix. Output from cards that use a 7-by-9-or-larger matrix may be 
subject to smearing or other distortions on the Color III. The Color II of- 
fers better resolution (560 by 240) and slightly more accurate conver- 
gence. It also has an intensity input that increases the number of possi- 
ble colors. This monitor can produce striking graphics displays and is 
usable with all eighty-column cards (5-by-7 dot matrix is still preferable). 
For most users, the DVM-I I/Color II combination should provide ex- 
cellent results. 

If higher-resolution RGB graphics boards or a board with analog 
color control should become available, the Color IV monitor ought to be 
considered. It has a resolution of 720 by 420 and its analog circuitry can 
produce an infinite range of colors. Up to ninety-six 5-by-7 characters 
can be displayed on each line. The Color IV should provide superior per- 
formance, even when used with the high-resolution eighty-column cards. 

More Eighty-Column Text Cards. While we're on the subject of vid- 
eo and eighty-column text cards, a couple of newcomers deserve atten- 
tion. The first is the Viewmax-80 from Micromax. This board offers ba- 
sic eighty -column operation with software video switching, a 7-by-9 char- 
acter matrix, and support of the game-port shift-key modification. In 
fact, the firmware automatically attempts to determine whether the shift- 
key mod is present. Particular care has been taken to make this board 
software-compatible with the Videx Videoterm. The Viewmax-80's main 
selling point, however, is its extremely low price. It's also backed with a 
two-year guarantee. 

For a more powerful board with advanced features, there is the Su- 
pervision from Techcom Enterprises. This unit offers superior display 
characteristics, including inverse, flashing, underline, half intensity, and 
an alternate character set. The flashing is a true on/off flash, not the 
alternating normal/inverse flash used by the Apple. All of these attrib- 
utes are available, in any combination, on a character-by-character ba- 
sis. This is accomplished by using a twelve-bit word to store each char- 
acter. Other features include line insert or delete, debug-character-set 
mode, and GOTOXY cursor positioning. As soon as word processing 
programs are modified to take advantage of the Supervision's expanded

features, it will finally be possible to see an eighty-column document with 
underlining, boldface, and so on right on the screen — -just as it will ap- 
pear when printed out. Gone (forever, let's hope) will be the messy con- 
trol characters or formatting commands that just clutter up a document 
when it is displayed on-screen. 

Although the documentation is a little thin, some information on the 
firmware's operation and access to the CRTC registers is included. This 
makes it possible, for example, to change the size of the cursor or its 
blink rate. 

Apple He. One of the enhancements the lie offers is its eighty-col- 
umn capability. Instead of requiring an entirely separate video board to 
generate eighty columns, the motherboard contains most of the neces- 
sary circuitry. In fact, activating a simple soft switch places the lie in 
eighty-column mode. What actually happens is that the dot-clock fre- 
quency is doubled to send out the characters faster. This in effect causes 
the characters to appear half of their normal width. Since the cpu clock 
is not changed, there's time to put out two characters for each cpu cycle. 
The video circuits can still only make one memory access during this 
time, however, so when no circuitry has been added, the Apple just spits 
out two copies of each character. 

Installing an eighty-column text card (either the standard card or the 
expanded memory one) in the special slot 0 makes a new mode possible. 
If the memory on the text card is used, two characters can be stored and 
displayed for each standard location. This added memory can be thought 
of as residing "on top of the normal screen memory from $400 through 
$7FF. Now when the video circuits grab a byte of memory from this lo- 
cation, they actually grab two bytes. One is stored temporarily while the 
other is being displayed (in one-half the time used for a forty-column 
character). Then the second byte from the text card RAM is sent to the 
character generator for display. Thus the characters displayed on the 
screen alternately come from the motherboard and text card RAM. This 
technique makes eighty-column operation much simpler on the He than 
it is on the counterpart lis. It also opens the door to double-resolution 
graphics, which should be possible with later versions of the lie. 

Video Compatibility. Our final topic this month concerns the com-

patibility of the Apple II (and He) video signal with other NTSC stan- 
dard equipment, including video-tape recorders (one-half-inch, three- 
quarter-inch, and one-inch), switchers, processing amplifiers, and other 
broadcast equipment. Although the Apple video signal is described as 
NTSC-compatible, monitors are just about the only equipment you can 
expect this to hold true for. Half-inch (that is. Beta and VHS) and three- 
quarter-inch (U-matic) VCRs usually record a decent black-and-white 
signal from the Apple, but the color signal may be distorted, scrambled, 
or nonexistent. Pre-Revision 7 boards with overly wide sync will prob- 
ably show no color at all. Production switchers and many proc amps 
(processing amplifiers, used to clean up distorted video signals) will not 
accept the Apple's video signal. 

The reason for this mess stems from the simplified approach the Ap- 
ple takes to generating video. The Apple's only rigid adherence to NTSC 
specifications is with the color subcarrier frequency. From there, how- 
ever, the Apple deviates just enough to produce compatibility problems. 

In the true NTSC standard, the 3.58 MHz signal is divided by 227.5 
to derive the horizontal timing. Vertical field rate is produced by divid- 
ing the horizontal timing signal by 262.5. As a consequence of these fig- 
ures, the video signal acquires several characteristics. First there is the 
odd number of lines per frame — 525. This means that each field con- 
tains a half line either at the beginning or end of the field. This is done to 
allow the fields to mesh, or interlace, within each other. 

The Apple, on the other hand, generates an even number of lines 
each field (262), for a total of 524 lines per frame. The Apple video is 
therefore noninterlaced. Because of this, making reference to both field 
rate and frame rate is somewhat redundant. Each field is a complete 
frame, and therefore both consist of 262 lines and get updated approxi- 
mately sixty times per second. To remain consistent with the standard 
NTSC jargon, however, two consecutive fields are often referred to as 
one frame. 

If you absolutely must make the Apple fully NTSC-compatible, you 
have only two possible choices. One is to add a special video board that 
generates proper video completely from scratch. Several such boards are 
available at prices in the thousands of dollars. 

Video Associates Labs offers the models VB-1 and VB-3 at $1,850 
and $2,400 respectively. Both of these boards "genlock" to an existing 
video source and then superimpose the Apple graphics display on top of 
it. The VB-3 has a built-in sync generator and can therefore stand alone 
as a video source for video taping. The VB-3 also has a built-in color 
background generator with full program control of luminance, hue, and 
saturation. Even the horizontal and burst phases of the video signal are 
adjustable from software. 

The Adwar ARS-170 from Adwar Video Corporation is another 
device that can be used to "standardize" the Apple video. Among other 
things, it converts the 524 lines-per-frame Apple video into the proper 
525-line format. The signal from this board may still not be completely 
standard, despite the $2,800 price tag for the ARS-170. 

Another company that has shown interest in Apple-NTSC compati- 
bility is Symtec. This company originally made a simple horizontal sync 
corrector board that improved the sync timing of older Apples. This was 
primarily done to bring the color burst into its proper time slot so that 
other equipment could recognize the Apple's video as a color signal. 
Since the Revision 7 motherboards also corrected this problem, this 
product became obsolete. 

Currently Symtec is manufacturing a $7,000 package called the PGS 
III, or Professional Graphics System. The PGS III is a complete rack- 
mounted graphics generator that just happens to connect to an Apple. It 
uses 32K of its own memory to store images with 512-by-192 resolution 
in any of more than four thousand colors. Both hue and intensity can be 
varied, and a special "transparent-pixel" mode allows computer-gen- 
erated text and graphics to be mixed with scenes from an external video 
source.

Here is a ragtag assortment of odds and ends from Apple III, thrown 
together almost untainted by logical sequence. Some have already been 
published elsewhere; some are obtainable in the fine print of Apple man- 
uals; and some are the fruit of personal investigation. Accuracy, particu- 
larly in the latter category, may not be uniformly high. So be warned. 

Let's face it. Extracting information from Apple Computer isn't the 
easiest thing in the world. In fact, it's usually faster, and more fun, to ask 
the Apple III itself There is no obvious reason for Apple's reticence. The 
folks at Apple intend, they say, to publish the SOS Reference Manual 
and, eventually, the Driver Writer's Guide. The reference manual exists 
already, more or less, as a textbook for the Apple III Technical Work- 
shop. If you're keen on writing assembly language for the III, by all 
means take that course. It tells you lots and lots, although not quite 
everything you might wish to know. Inquiries, however, seem to drift off 
into never-never land. 

Why so secretive? The effect seems primarily to impede the efforts of 
would-be Apple III programmers, which you might suppose would not 
be in Apple's interest. Maybe they are protecting something else? The 
techniques of RAM-based operating systems may have a more general 
applicability . . . perhaps to the Lisa? 

No doubt a recognized software development firm, prepared to sign 



certain agreements, can obtain source materials and technical assistance. 
But many bright ideas must incubate and grow and be played with on 
the machine before they become sufficiently clear and explicit to warrant 
a formal approach to Apple. A lot of maybe-we-coulds must simply have 
vanished because the programmer had insufficient information to per- 
mit experimentation. 

A Memory Map. At any one time, the 6502 cpu works with 64K ad- 
dresses arranged as follows: 



0000.. 1FFF 
lower s-bank 



2000.. 9FFF 
user bank 0-6 



AOOO..FFFF

The system bank is always on-line. It contains SOS. Kernel and other 
goodies. The user banks are switched in and out. Only one user bank is 
on-line at any given moment. 

Table 1 describes the function of pages in the lower system bank. 

Upper System Bank: $AOOO..FFFF. SOS.Kernel occupies 
$BCOO..FFFF. In the future SOS.Kernel may get longer and extend 
down as far as $8800. SOS.Interp, which is "absolute" code, is normally 
loaded below SOS.Kernel. Actually, it is loaded into the highest user 
bank (bank 6 in a 256K machine) beginning at some predetermined lo- 
cation ($7600 for Pascal). It may then extend upward for any length, up 
to the lower end of SOS.Kernel (presently SBCOO). Thus it usually over- 
laps from bank 6, a user bank, into system bank $AOOO..BBFF. This is 
important because the overlap gives the interpreter a sizable area in sys- 




00: "True" zero page. Used early in boot sequence, and as the 

zero page for interrupt handlers. 
01: "Normal" 6502 stack. Addressed by PHA, JSR, and so on, 

whenever bit 2 of environnnent register ($FFDF) is set. Used as 

stack page by interrupt handlers, drivers, and by SOS. Kernel 

itself.

04. .07: Text page 1. In eighty-column mode holds screen memory for 
even-numbered columns 0,2, ..78 (decimal). 

08. .OB: Text page 2. Memory for odd-numbered columns 1,3, ..79 
(decimal). Note: Corresponding addresses in TextPagel and 
TextPage2 are interchanged by the relation: (high byte) XOR 
$00. 

00. .OF: Character set. 

10..11: File names, prefix, ? access routes to files. 

12.. 13: Used as I/O buffer for reading directories. 

14: Xbyte page when zero page is $18. Used by SOS. Kernel and 

by drivers. 
15: Typeahead buffer. 

16: Xbyte page when zero page is $1A. Used by interpreter and by 

assembly modules included in user programs. 
17: Keyboard layout.

19: SOS data and jump tables. 

1A: "User" zero page. Used by interpreter. 

IB: "Alternate" 6502 stack when zero page is $1A (zero page XOR 
$01). Used by interpreter. Alternate stack is addressed by 
PHA, JSR, and so on, whenever bit 2 of environment 
register ($FFDF) is clear.

tern bank for code that is always on-line. Bank-switching must always be 
done from system bank. If you switch banks while running in a user 
bank — puuff! Suddenly you aren't. 

A very short interpreter might lie only in user bank or only in system 
bank. The loading site and length are determined by the writer when the 
interpreter is created. It is absolute code ".org'd" on the intended load- 
ing site. 

Usually the upper system bank is all RAM, except for 
$FFDO..FFDF and $FFEO..FFEF, which are the onboard D and E 
VIAs (versatile interface adapters). In particular, if bit 6 of the environ- 
ment register is clear, then $COOO..CFFF is RAM. If that bit is set, then 
this area is I/O. There are also $20 bytes of RAM "under" the VIAs at 
$FFDO..FFEF. Normally they are off-line. These RAM bytes can be ac- 
cessed only by "8F" extended addressing. This small area of RAM is 
unique in that it is not disturbed by a control-reset reboot, so that's 
where they keep the last valid clock value — less useful, since you ob- 
tained your functioning clock chip. 

The RAM of SOS.Kernel area $COOO..FFFF can be write-protected 
by setting bit 3 of the environment register. Normally this RAM is pro- 
tected while the interpreter is running. This is the user environment, and 
Apple doesn't trust you. It is unprotected in the driver, SOS.Kernel, 
and interrupt handler environments. Write-protection doesn't affect 
I/O $COOO..CFFF when that is enabled, nor the VIA registers 
$FFDO..FFEF. 

Highest User Bank: Bank 6 in a 256K Machine. At boot time 
SOS.Interp is loaded here, at whatever site the writer has designated, as- 
suming, as is usually the case, that the interpreter is not confined entirely 
to $AO(X)..BBFF in system bank. Next the drivers are loaded below 
SOS.Interp, one after another, in whatever order they are encountered in 
SOS. Driver, which is just the reverse of the order listed by the System 
Configuration Program. For this purpose a modular driver is just one

driver, no matter how many modular units it may contain. The drivers 
extend, if necessary, down to the bottom of banlc 6. If more space is 
needed, they continue from the top of the next lower user bank ($9FFF 
with bank 5 switched in). Each driver, however, must be completely con- 
tained within its bank, so if there is insufficient room for the complete 
driver in bank 6 it will be placed entirely in bank 5. Any space left over 
below the drivers is free and available for requisition by the interpreter. 

Interpreter Strategy. Interpreters should never assume they are resi- 
dent in the highest bank, even though that is where they are normally 
loaded. Interpreters will run perfectly well in other banks. All you need 
to do is copy the user bank portion of the interpreter into the correspond- 
ing bytes in another (free and available) bank. Then switch in that bank 
(being careful not to self-destruct) and perform a jump to the first byte of 
interpreter code. The interpreter still overlaps into system bank 
($AOOO..BBFF) just the way it always did. Bank-switching affects only 
the user bank. Interpreters, therefore, should always find out where they 
are by checking the bank register (SFFEF), never by making assump- 
tions or by using location $1901, which does contain the highest bank 
number. 

This relocation trick can be used for interpreter-switching schemes. A 
small switching interpreter is loaded from disk as the original 
SOS.Interp. It is placed entirely in the upper part of the highest user bank, 
with the drivers immediately below. The switching interpreter, in turn, 
loads in another interpreter (perhaps Pascal) but places the user-bank 
portion in a lower bank, where it runs very happily. The switching inter- 
preter remains in the highest bank, taking up very little room, just wait- 
ing for you to call it back by pressing a special key combination (for 
which you will need a small modification of the console driver). Then the 
switching interpreter can load in, and run, some other interpreter, such as 
Basic. 

User Bank 0: "8F" Addressing. The "zero-page anomaly" in Apple 
III means that every time the 6502 executes a zero-page instruction it ac- 
tually operates on the designated zero page, found as the value of the 
zero-page register (SFFEX)). The same thing happens when the (sixteen- 
bit) operand of an instruction has $00 in the high byte, since that also re- 
fers to zero page. Similariy, in extended addressing, if the place you are 
headed has $00 in the high byte of its address, then that is also interpret- 
ed as a zero-page location and you are given whatever is the current zero 
page. But that may not be what you want. 

Extended addressing looks at a 64K stretch of memory comprising 
two consecutive user banks. In extended addressing, $0000 is the bottom 
of one user bank and SFFFF is the top of the next higher user bank. 
Whichever pair of user banks is active depends on the Xbyte of the ex- 
tended address. This works fine except for the lowest page of the lower of 
the two user banks in the pair. That would have to be addressed as 
$0Qxjt/8b. But the high byte of that address is $00, so you are given zero 
page instead. 

Normally you get around the zero-page anomaly by decrementing 
the Xbyte. Then you are looking at a different pair of user banks, with 
your target bank as the higher member of the pair. The lowest page of 
that bank can then be addressed as $80x.x/8b-l. But what about the 
lowest page of bank 0? There is no lower user bank to put underneath it 
in a pair. Hence 8F addressing. 

8F is an Xbyte which, when present, causes the extended addressing 
mechanism to look at 64K of memory constructed as follows: 

0000.. 1FFF 2000. .9FFF A000..FFFF 

lowers-bank bankO uppers-bank 

It is almost exactly like system addressing (Xbyte $00), with bank 0 
switched in. (There is one other interesting feature. It is all RAM, in- 
cluding the RAM beneath the VIA registers $FFDO..FFEF.) 

Thus if you are doing a lot of talking to user bank 0, you should use 
8F as the Xbyte and address the bank as $2000..9FFF, corresponding to 
$0000. .7FFF in the bank. Then you can get to the lowest page without 
worrying about the zero-page anomaly. 

User Bank 0; Graphics. Which, of course, is why you'll want to be 
talking to bank 0. That's where graphics are, when graphics are allo- 
cated. Pascal and Basic each provide for allocations of $00, $40, or $80 



pages of graphics, depending on the graphics mode. Pascal also allows 
$20 pages, which is enough for one lo-res black-and-white buffer. Hi-res 
mode appears to interieave two lo-res modes in alternate columns or 
groups of pixels, much as eighty-column text interleaves two forty-col- 
umn screens. 

The number of pages allocated for graphics is stored in location 
$1907 in the SOS data area. Presumably this byte is used by the video 
generator apparatus, as are surrounding bytes in that area. 

In black-and-white lo-res mode (BW280), buffer 1 runs from 
$2000/208F..3FFF/3F8F (which is $0000..1FFF in bank 0). Buffer 2 is 
found in $4000/408F..5FFF/5F8F. In buffer 1 the lowest byte ($2000/ 
208F) represents the upper-left corner of the screen. Each bit repre- 
sents one pixel. Successive bytes (and their contained bits) are in order 
from the left edge of the screen. One accesses individual bytes by indirect 
Y-indexed addressing (extended addressing) off the base address, which 
is the leftmost byte in that horizontal row. The following algorithm (for 
BW280, buffer 1) relates corresponding bytes in successive rows. It was 
discovered empirically and is doubtless pathetically slow:

if < $2000 then add $2000 and subtract $80 
if < $3C00 tlien add $0400 and subtract $28 
next line down: add $0400 

if >= $4000 then subtract $2000 and add $80 
if >= $2400 then subtract $0400 and add $28 

In hi-res mode (BW560) alternate bytes (groups of eight pixels) come 
from corresponding bytes of the two lo-res buffers just discussed. Thus 
the sequence is $2000, $4000, $2001 , $4001 Hi-res buffer 2 is the cor- 
responding structure beginning at $6000/608F. In color mode (CP280) 
the "upper lo-res buffer" presumably contains color information. We are 
not sure about COL 140 mode. And we are not sure if the base address 
algorithm holds for these modes. 

When you are ready for the video generator to display your graph- 
ics, it is necessary to fiddle with the soft switches (see table 8). Graphics 
information is always taken from bank 0, regardless of which user bank 
is switched in. Presumably this is hard-wired, although it is just conceiv- 
able that the source bank is software-selected. If so, we don't know how. 

The Text Pages: $0400..07FF and $0800..0BFF. Apple III text 
memory is very similar to Apple II; possibly identical for forty-column 
mode. In eighty-column mode the two "text pages" are interleaved: even 
columns from $0400..07FF, odd columns from $0800..0BFF. The rea- 
son for this peculiar arrangement is found in the direct memory access 
(DMA) apparatus of the video generator. When Apple III was designed 
for an eighty -column display, the video generator had to call up twice the 
amount of information as it did for the forty-column display of Apple II. 
But it did not have twice the time in which to do it. So the memory-fetch 
path in Apple III was made sixteen bits wide. Every data fetch actually 
gets two bytes. The video generator uses both. The 6502 chip uses one 
and ignores the other (except in the case of the Xbyte, which is that extra 
byte used in extended addressing). The memory fetch does not get two 
adjacent bytes. It gets the byte at address and the byte at address: high 
byte XOR $0C. Thus a fetch to $0400 also gets the byte from $0800, 
which the video generator puts in the odd column. And this is also the 
reason why the Xbyte page is related to its zero page by the same rela- 
tion, high byte XOR $0C. 

The Apple II "screen holes" are there, but you aren't supposed to use 
them for peripheral card scratchpad space. In the Apple III these loca- 
tions are used as transfer ports when downloading character sets to the 
video generator. But downloading occurs only at boot time or when pro- 
grams deliberately change character sets. It is relatively rare. The rest of 
the time these locations seem to be idle. It may be that a peripheral card 
could use them for a while. But it's illegal according to the definition of 
Apple III. 

It is possible to write directly to the screen from assembly, bypassing 
the console driver. Just put ASCII codes in the appropriate memory lo- 
cations. The high bit should be clear for inverse and set for normal, as- 
suming you are using a standard (not inverted) character set. 

The bytes in each horizontal line are accessed by X-indexed address- 
ing off the base address, which is the leftmost byte of that line (see table 2).

Table 2. Text screen line numbers versus base addresses. 

In eighty -column mode use X : = column DIV 2. If the column number 
is odd, you must also add $0400 to the base address given in the table. 
Alternatively, the base address and index may be computed with a mod- 
ification of the Apple II subroutine Bascalc (table 3).

Table 3. Subroutine Bascalc. 



The Character Set: $OCOO..OFFF. At boot time the system charac- 
ter set is loaded from SOS.Driver and stored in these pages. Similarly, if 
you download another character set from a program by issuing a 
DControl call #16 or #17 to the console driver, the new set is also placed 
here. But these pages are not the active character set in current use by the 
video generator. This is merely a staging area. From these four pages the 
character set is further transferred to the video generator's storage area, 
wherever that is. It is not in addressable memory. Presumably the ma- 
chine contains a IK RAM chip dedicated for this purpose, analogous to 
the ROM chip beneath the Apple II keyboard that contains the charac- 
ter set for that machine. In any event, you can change the copy in 
$OCOO..OFFF all you wish, but nothing happens. 

The console driver uses a complex mechanism to transfer the charac- 
ter set into the video generator. It sets up an interrupt-driven back- 
ground program (spooler) by allocating system internal resources (SIR) 
numbers $05, $06, and $10. The video-generator mechanism then inter- 
acts with the SIR#06 interrupt handler (embedded in the console driver) 
to transfer the character definitions at its leisure. The computer's atten- 
tion is returned to the user's programs, and the video generator inter- 
rupts when it feels ready for another swallow. There may be simpler ways 
if you are willing to let the main program wait. For an entire character 
set the download procedure takes about a second to complete. 

The actual transfer involves the ErVIA's peripheral control register 
($FFEC), interrupt enable register ($FFEE), a couple of sites in $C000 
I/O space ($CODA and $CODB) that are probably soft switches, and the 
notorious screen holes. Apparently the interrupt handler moves the char- 
acter descriptions piecemeal from the $0C00 area to the screen holes and 
then alerts the video generator to move them on from there into its own 
dedicated RAM. 

This transfer could probably proceed just as easily from any mem- 
ory buffer to the screen holes; the $0C00 staging area is merely a conven- 
ience. But if you are operating from a background program, and if that 
program is the interrupt handler itself, then the buffer must be in system 
bank. If the buffer were in a user bank it would surely go off-line due to 
bank-switching. Extended addressing is not available for interrupt han- 
dlers; it doesn't work on the true zero page. Hence the $0C00 buffer. 

Typehead Buffer: $1500..15FF. Page $15 is set aside for use by the 
console driver as a typeahead buffer. It is nothing more than a first-in- 
first-out queue. Actually two queues. The first queue ($1500.. 157F) con- 
tains KBD values, which are the ASCII codes generated by the key- 
board. For each KBD there is also a KBDFLG byte, the second key- 
board byte, which fiags the various modifier keys. KBDFLG is stored in 



the corresponding byte in the second queue ($1580..15FF). The console 
driver maintains a count of the current number of characters in the 
queue and keeps index pointers to the current front and rear of the 
queue. 

When a key is pressed, KBD appears at $C000 just as it does in Ap- 
ple II. At this time KBDFLG also becomes available at $C008. The key- 
board interrupt is cleared with the keyboard strobe, $C010, just as it is in 
Apple II. 

KBD and KBDFLG are picked up by the keyboard (SIR#02) inter- 
rupt handler, which is embedded in the console driver. If they represent 
one of the five console control keys, that function is executed immedi- 
ately. Otherwise, if a standard key was pressed, KBD would be used as 
an index into the keyboard layout look-up table (page $17). KBDFLG 
and the modified value of KBD are then stored in the typeahead buffer. 
The console driver will retrieve them when it feels so inclined. 

Before exiting, the keyboard interrupt handler also checks to see if 
the "any-key" event is armed or if this is the "attention" event character. 
If so, the handler queues up the appropriate "event." Later, before re- 
turning to the user program, SOS checks the event queue and transfers 
control to the event handler as a subroutine. 

SOS Data and Jump Tables: $1900..19FF. The first few bytes on 
page $19 contain important status information (table 4). During ordi- 
nary business, some (or all) of these bytes control the video generator 
and/or similar accessory apparatus. But when the monitor is running, 
they have no perceptible effect. So there must be more than one way to 
control the video generator. 

1900: 10 ?? 

1901: 06 Highest user memory bank. 

1902: 00 Console control #7 and #9. Setting bit 7 suspends screen 

output; bit 6 will "flush" screen output. Low nibble: ?? 
1903: 00 High bit set indicates NMI pending. 
1904: 8F ?? 
1905: 19 ?? 

1906: 82 Console control #5. Clearing bit 7 turns off video. Bit 6 may. 
be involved in graphics. Low nibble contains text mode 
[0..2]. 

1907: 00 Number of pages allocated for graphics. 
Table 4. SOS status info. Some bytes control video generator. 

Page $19 also contains a jump table beginning at $1910. The jumps 
take the form "1913: 4C CA E2 JMP E2CA". The table provides fixed 
entry addresses for certain subroutines that apparently will be supported 
in future versions of SOS. The list is in table 5. Those marked with an as- 
terisk are documented by Apple and are legal to use. The others . . . well, 
they do appear in the jump table.

program counter and all register values for use in debugging. Other SOS 
routines store various temporaries on this page. 

The copyright notice at $1990 is a good spot if you want to store 
things that can be found from the Monitor. If you want to store a lot of 
stuff you can also use the character set area. 

Those Registers: the Onboard 6522 VI As. The two VIAs are re- 
ferred to as D-VIA ($FFDO..FFDF) and E-VIA ($FFEX)..FFEF) re- 
spectively. They are fully occupied with Apple III hardware manipula- 
tions. You cannot, for example, use the VIA timers for your own pur- 
poses. The VIAs manage bank-switching, zero-page selection, and much 
of the other machinery that permits Apple III to accommodate the 64K 
address space of the 6502 cpu chip. 

SFFEF: Bank register (E-VIA lORA). The low nibble selects the cur- 
rently switched-in bank. The high nibble is generally $F. Attempts to 
change the high nibble have no effect. Those four bits are flags for inter- 
rupt requests from the slots. 

SFFDF: Environment register (D-VIA lORA). Table 6 lists the sig- 
nificance of its bits. Apple would be happier if you confined your atten- 
tion to bit 7 and didn't mess with the others. Table 7 contains a variety of 
information about the various standard environments. 

SFFEX): Zero-page register. Selects the current zero page, which can 
be assigned to any page in memory. If alternate stack is enabled (bit 2 of

Note: Upon entry to an interrupt handler X points to a $20 byte 
scratchpad area on zero page. These bytes should be addressed 
$00,X and so on. If the interrupt source is the onboard ACIA then Y 
contains the ACIA status register. 

Table 7. The standard environments. 



SFFDF is clear) then all stack-using opcodes use the current zero page 
XOR $01. Extended addressing, on the other hand, functions only for 
zero pages in the range $18.. IF. The user zero page is $1A. That's you 
and/or the interpreter. Drivers and SOS. Kernel use $18. Interrupt han- 
dlers use $00. SOS is supposed to decide these things; you are not. The 
SOS call handling routine even checks to see if the caller's zero page is 
$1A. If not, it crashes the system. Somewhere in darkest Cupertino, Ap- 
ple maintains a coven of witch doctors who will cheerfully do unspeak- 
able things to your image, should you violate this trust. 

$FFDD: "Any-slot" interrupt flag. When a peripheral card in one of 
the slots pulls down the interrupt line, the interrupt handler is entered 



with 6502 interrupts disabled. The interrupt handler is, of course, re- 
sponsible for clearing the interrupt condition on the card. If the inter- 
rupt handler wishes to enable 6502 interrupts (as it should if it will run 
longer than 500 microseconds) then it must also clear the "any-slot" in- 
terrupt flag by storing $02 in $FFDD. Othervkdse the interrupt manager 
will do it for you when the handler exits. 

I/O Space: $COOO..CFFF. I /O space is on-line when bit 6 of the en- 
vironment register ($FFDF) is set. It is actually $C000..C4FF and 
$C800..CFFF. The intervening bytes $C500..C7FF are always RAM. 
Table 8 lists those registers of which we have some clue. There are many 
mysterious others. When in doubt, there is a good chance that a regis- 
ter's function is similar or identical to its role in Apple II. 

COOO: KBD. ASCII value of the most recent keypress. 

COOS: KBDFLG. Bits are flags for modifier keys.

Notice that the $10 bytes beginning $C080, $CODO, $C0E0, and 
SCOFO are not used for slots in the III. In Apple II they would be slots 0, 
5, 6, and 7 respectively. There may or may not be a clue to their function 
in the assignment of various connecting plugs to imaginary slots in emu- 
lation mode. For example, $COFO-l- is the ACIA (asynchronous com- 
munication interface adapter), as indicated in table 9. The ACIA runs the 
serial port, which in emulation mode is assigned to an ethereal slot 7. 
Similarly, emulation mode assigns the floppies to slot 6, and the floppy 
drivers (buried in SOS. Kernel at $E899) probably access bytes in 
$COEO..COEF, and in $CODO..CODF as well. But this may only be spec- 
ulation.

$C800..CFFF is a 2K peripheral card expansion space used "in com- 
mon" by all the slots. As in Apple II it can be selected by referencing one 
of the peripheral card I/O locations assigned to that slot. SCFFF does 
deselect all slots, but $C020 (formerly the cassette output toggle) is the 
preferred Apple III deselection strobe. 

There are some new rules for using $C800 space that are intended to 
mesh with Apple Ill's interrupt-driven operating system. You are sup- 
posed to allocate the space prior to use by calling the SOS subroutine 
SelCSOO. The slot number is passed in the [A] register on a JSR to the en- 
try point at $1922. (See the subroutine listing in table 9.) A value of $00 
deselects all slots. Note that SelCSOO saves the slot number in SDFCO; 
this allows the interrupt manager to restore the proper card allocation 
should an interrupt occur. The interrupt manager routinely deselects all 
slots on entry and reselects the proper slot on the way out. 

The documentation states that SelCSOO may be called from any en- 
vironment including interpreters (except an NMI handler). This turns 
out not to be entirely true. The subroutine builds an instruction on-the- 
fly by storing the slot number ORA #C0 as high byte of the operand in 
bit $COFF. The bit instruction then physically enables $CSOO space for 
that slot. But this area of SOS is write-protected while running in the user 
environment, so the STA instruction doesn't work and the subroutine 
fails without notifying you. If you want to call SelCSOO from the user en- 
vironment you must enable write by clearing bit 3 of the environment 
register ($FFDF). 

There must be another soft switch somewhere. When you enter the 
Monitor (with control-open-apple-reset), it comes up in forty-column 
mode. You can change to eighty-column mode with escape-S, and back 
again with escape-4. From eighty-column mode you might suppose you 
could also change back to forty columns by fiddling with the soft 
switches, perhaps by reading $C052 and maybe $C054. Things change, 
and you can tell it's really trying hard. But no combination quite makes 
it. We don't know why. 

System Internal Resources: SIRs. When an interrupt occurs, the in- 
terrupt manager must know which interrupt handler goes with which in-

terrupting device and where the handler address is located in memory. 
The SIR allocation scheme provides a look-up table. It also establishes 
"ownership" of a resource in order to prevent squabbles. Resources 
should therefore be allocated whether there will be interrupts or not. 
Somewhere in your code, place the following data table: 

SIRADDR .equ SIRTABLE 

SIRTABLE .byte 00 ; SIR# 

.byte 00 ; ID code (will be assigned by SOS) 

.word handler ; interrupt handler address (or 
$0000) 

.byte bank ; interrupt handler bank 

Allocation is performed by JSR AllocSIR ($1913) and dealloca- 
tion by JSR DealcSIR ($1916). The 6502 registers must contain: X = 
SIRADDR; Y = SIRADDR+1; A = total number of bytes in 
SIRTABLE. This will be $05, or some multiple of $05 in the event that 
several resources are allocated at the same time. AllocSIR returns with 
carry clear if the resource is successfully allocated. 

Table 10 lists the numbers assigned to various resources. Examina- 
tion of AllocSIR suggests that the range is $00.. 17. There are a lot of 
question marks. One wonders about the digital/analog audio converter, 
the paddle ports, and other mysteries, such as whether the interrupt line 
of the MM5S167A clock chip is wired up.

Boot Sequence: On power-up, or after control-reset, the boot proc- 
ess begins in ROM#l (ROM#2 doesn't yet exist). Low-level diagnostics 
are performed. Then block 0 is read from the disk in the built-in drive. 
This is the SOS boot code and is present on every disk that has been for- 
matted by the System Utilities program. It must be present for a success- 
ful boot. It consists of one block of "absolute" code and is loaded into 
the computer at $A0OO, where it begins to run. 

The boot code begins by locating and switching in the highest bank 
of RAM. Then it goes back to the disk and loads in five more blocks 
(blocks 1..5). These are placed in $A200..ABFF. Block 1 currently con- 
tains all zeros; blocks 2. .5 are the disk directory. The boot code then 
scans the directory and locates SOS. Kernel, which it loads into memory 
at $1E00..73FF. 

When SOS.Kernel begins running, it promptly relocates bytes 
$3000..73FF into the area $BC00..FFFF. This is the functional 
SOS.Kernel. The loader portion is eventually overwritten and discarded. 
First, however, it locates and loads SOS.Interp and loads the drivers 
from SOS.Driver. It then initializes SOS.Kernel and each of the drivers. 
Finally, control is transferred to the first instruction in the interpreter and 
you are in business. 

Data Disks: Your Own Boot Code. If you want to end up in Apple 
III native mode, the boot process had better find the SOS boot code in 
block 0 on the disk in the built-in drive. Any disks you ever expect to use 
as SOS boot disks must have that code. On the other hand, you may 
wish to create data disks that have the SOS directory structure but can- 
not be booted. Or you may want the disk to boot, but to end up with 
some entirely different operating system in the machine, such as an emu- 
lator, for example. For either of these alternatives you will want to put 
your own code in block 0 on your disk. 

You start with a single block: the 512 bytes contained in block 0. It 
will be loaded and begin to run at $A000. You may then use the ROM

subroutines to load in more blocks, so you can actually requisition as 
much space as you require. At the time your code begins to run, you will 
be in the Monitor or something very similar. The environment register 
reads $77, zero page is $03, and bank 0 is switched in. You have avail- 
able all the hardware, including the VIA registers, extended addressing 
(with proper zero page), and all the internal resources. You do not, of 
course, have any of the SOS subroutines and facilities. 

Your code should be assembled as "absolute" code by the Pascal 
6502 assembler and should be ".org'd" on $A000. For data disks it 
should end in an infinite loop. Word Juggler, for example, creates data 
disks that, when you try to boot them, print "Can't boot Word Juggler 
data disk" in the middle of the screen and politely hang the computer. 

Formatting Data Disks. After you've assembled your own boot 
code, it is a relatively simple matter to format data disks from applica- 
tion programs. It can be done entirely from Pascal and almost entirely 
from Basic. From Basic you will also need an invokable module that will 
write to a floppy disk by block number, just as Unitwrite will do in Pas- 
cal. The assembly source text for such a module is appended at the end of 
this article. 

The floppy format driver (FMTDX) is activated by issuing a DCon- 
trol call, code number 254 ($FE), to the appropriate driver (.FMTDl for 
the built-in drive). In Pascal this is done with Unitstatus procedure. In Ba- 
sic you use the Request.Inv invokable module that comes on the Apple 
III Basic boot disk. If you're working in assembly you just issue SOS call 
$83. When the DControl call is issued, the format process begins imme- 
diately. All error checking and confirmation requests must be done by 
your program before you issue the call. 

The DControl call must specify a control list buffer. FMTDX.Driver 
expects a one-page (256-byte) buffer that will be reproduced on each page 
of the new disk. Normally this buffer should contain all zeros. The for- 
matter places address code on each track and sector and fills the data 
fields with zeros, or whatever you put in your buffer. Then it quits. 

You now have a formatted disk. It is not yet a SOS disk. It contains 
neither a directory nor the block 0 boot code. You must store those your- 



self from program buffers using Unitwrite (if you are working in Pas- 
cal). If you ever want to use the disk as a SOS boot disk, just copy block 
0 from some other boot disk. Otherwise transfer your own code. Re- 
member to chop off the header block, which the assembler will have 
placed in front of your code. Start the transfer at block 1 of the codefile. 

Next you must install a directory. The minimum requirements for a 
usable SOS directory are listed in table 11. You must store the indicated 
byte values on the disk. Just put them in the proper place in the 5 12- byte 
buffer and write the whole block onto the disk. 

The boot code— blocks 0..1 (bytes 0000. .03FF on the disk) 
Your code, or the SOS code from another boot disk 

The directory— blocks 2. .5 (bytes 0400. .OBFF) 
0400: 00 00 03 00 

0404: Fx— where x is the length of the desired volume name in the 
low nibble. The high nibble should contain F, for root directory

0414: 75 

0422: C3 27 OC 00 00 06 00 18 01

the bit map

on volume )

Table 11. Minimum requirements for a SOS disk. 

Word Juggler manages to write all this information onto the disk by 
a short segment of elegant and compact code. The utilities program uses 
the brute-force approach. It simply includes fourteen pages of a stan- 
dard SOS structure (mostly zeros) and transfers the whole thing to disk 
in one piece. No wonder the utilities program is 123 blocks long.

Device.IO.Inv invokable module contains two procedures. In Basic they 
are external procedures and require the perform statement (see page 162, 

Apple Business Basic Manual). 
The procedures are 

unitread (% devnum%, @ buf% (0), % length%, % block% ) 
unitwrite (% devnum%, @ buf% (0), % length%, % block% ) 

These procedures read from or write to a specified block number 
(block%) on the disk in a specified device number (devnum%). They 
transfer (length%) bytes to or from the buffer in memory. The buffer 
must contain enough bytes or Unitread will spill data over onto sur- 
rounding memory with disastrous results. Normally the buffer should be 
dimensioned as an integer array; for example, DIM buf%(512). This 
buffer will contain more than enough room for two blocks (1,024 bytes). 

Unitwrite is a dangerous procedure. There is absolutely no protec- 
tion from errors. It is easy to write all over a disk directory, destroying it 
and rendering the entire disk unusable. 

The device numbers of the floppy disks are .Dl = 1, .D2 = 2, and 
so on. 

After typing in the text, save it to any pathname, perhaps Devio.Text. 
Then assemble it to the corresponding codefile, Devio.Code. Finally, 
change the name to Device.IO.Inv. If the assembler is not allowed to ap- 
pend the suffix .code, the file-type designation will get all screwed up and 
it won't invoke.

Yes, we know it's springtime and the sun is 
shining, and we'd all rather be outside play- 
ing, but we only meet once a month, so let's get 
through with this; then we can go out and get 
a tan. 

The System Master and Sample Programs 
disks that come with the Apple have some use- 
ful and interesting things on them, but sooner 
or later you're going to have to use disks other 
than those two, unless you're the type of person 
who buys an expensive tape deck and listens to 
only the freebie stereo demonstration tape and 
no others. 

Even if you plan on forever using prewrit- 
ten programs and never writing a single pro- 
gram of your own, you'll probably need blank 
disks for storing data generated by programs. 

One of the nice things about using the Apple 
is that it takes care of storing things for you. 
Thanks to the computer's memory and those 
wonderful things called disks, you don't have to 
worry about where stuff goes, how much room 
it takes up, or where to look for it. 

The computer's memory is already set up 
for you. When you load programs from disk, 
the computer already knows where to put them. 
Disks, however, present a different problem. 
When Apple puts together its computers, it 
knows that whatever language or operating sys- 
tem you'll be using, it will be stored inside just 
fine. But disk manufacturers make disks for all 
different computers, and each computer is ca- 
pable of using different operating systems. 

So, to avoid discriminating against users of 
different systems (and to save themselves extra 
work), the disk manufacturers crank out disks 
in such a way that they can be used by anyone, 
regardless of the computer or operating system. 
It's the same reason the supermarket sells eggs 
in the shell. If they sold than aheady scrambled, 
jjeople who like boiled eggs wouldn't be able to 
use them, bakers wouldn't be able to separate 
the whites from the yolks, and sunnyside up 
would be out of the question. 

That's just fine for them, but what about us? 
Before you make an omelet, you have to 
scramble the eggs; before you use your new 
disk, you have to put it in a form that's under- 
standable to DOS. This process is also called 
initializing the disk. The natural reaction to this 



bit of news is usually, "That's crazy. I never 
have to format my cassette tapes to record on 
them; why do I have to format a disk? Grrr!" 
Perfectly understandable, but it's not the same 
thing. 

Another way to look at disk formatting is to 
think of two different reading systems. The first 
one is the way we're accustomed to reading — 
each line from left to right, a whole line at a 
time. The second reading system is for people 
who have a rare eye disorder that prevents them 
from moving their eyes back and forth. To save 
them from moving their heads from left to right 
all the time, the second reading system has them 
reading the first three words of each line, going 
from top to bottom. When they reach the bot- 
tom of the page, they go back to the top and 
read the next three words of each line, and 
so on. 

It's easy to see that if you don't know who 
will be reading a book, you won't know how to 
write on the page; all sorts of confusion could 
arise with the good-eyes people reading the 
books written for the bad-eyes people. Operat- 
ing systems work the same way. Disks in- 
tended for use with DOS, for instance, can't be 
read or written to by computers using CP/M, 
and vice versa. And when you consider all the 
other types of computers with all their operat- 
ing systems, you can see why disk makers 
threw up their hands and said, "Fine. We'll 
make the things; you pjeople format them how- 
ever you want." 

Now that we're convinced that disk for- 
matting is a privilege and not a chore, let's 
break out a new disk. Most of the time, whether 
you're using a database, spreadsheet program, 
word processor, or adventure game, any infor- 
mation you store will have to go on a disk that's 
been initialized. That's because, when you're 
trying to save information, the computer looks 
at the way your disk is set up, and if there are no 
"lines" or boundaries on it defining how things 
should be written, the computer panics and 
doesn't know where it's safe to write. 

Formatting a disk is just like setting up a 
chart. You don't have to determine where the 
lines are drawn, however. DOS 3.3 sets up the 
disk with thirty-five tracks (concentric circles 
like lanes on a track field) and sixteen sectors 



(like pie slices). DOS knows how to read things 
written in this form and none other. Any varia- 
tions on this setup — thirty-four tracks or fifteen 
sectors, for instance — will just confuse and frus- 
trate it. 

Boot any disk that already has DOS on it. 
Either the System Master or Sample Programs 
disk will do. When the disk stops spinning, 
DOS will have been loaded, as well as the disk's 
greeting program (the program that loads first 
when the disk is booted, remember?). All you 
have to do now is copy the DOS that's now in 
memory to your new blank disk. In doing so, 
you also format the new disk with tracks and 
sectors just like those on the System Master. 

The command to begin the whole process is 
init, which is short for "initialize." Just like load 
and save, init requires that you use it with a pro- 
gram name tacked onto it. You can do this right 
now, by typing init Hello. 

At this point, the disk drive will grunt a few 
times, spin the disk around for about thirty sec- 
onds, and then stop. Here's what's going on. 
When the Apple sees you type init Hello, it un- 
derstands you as saying, "I want you to do three 
things. First, look at the DOS that's in memory 
now, and divide the disk into tracks and sectors 
just like those on the disk that this DOS came 
from. Second, copy DOS from memory to the 
disk. Third, take the Basic program that's in 
memory, put it on the disk as the greeting pro- 
gram, and save it under the name Hello." 

When the initializing has been completed, 
catalog the disk and you'll see that the greeting 
program is the only program on it. The rest of 
the disk is almost all empty. 

It's important to note here that as time goes 
by you'll hear people refer to the greeting pro- 
gram as the hello program. Truth is, you can 
call the greeting program anything you want 
(Bonjour, Ace Face, Omelet), but Hello is the 
conventional name. Whatever name you give it, 
the Apple will look for that program whenever 
you boot that disk. 

You can also have the greeting program do 
anything you want. While the one on the Sys- 
tem Master happens to load Integer Basic into 
memory, you can write your own that will cata- 
log the disk, load another program, or do noth- 
ing at all. The choice is yours.

o r T A I 1^ 



MAY 1983 



If you're using the greeting program on the 
System Master as the greeting program on your 
new disk, you might be concerned when you 
boot it up and it says, "File not found." That's 
because the program tries to load Integer Basic 
from disk, but Integer Basic isn't there. You can 
get around this stumper every time you boot the 
disk by writing your own greeting program be- 
fore initializing the disk. 

We said that except for the greeting pro- 
gram the rest of the disk is "almost all empty." 
What that means is the disk has no other pro- 
grams or files on it. DOS, however, takes up 
three tracks, and the disk's catalog takes up 
another. The rest of the disk is blank. Just to 
confuse things some more, "blank" is one of 
those words computer people use loosely. When 
someone gives you a disk and tells you it's 
blank, that means that either it's uninitialized or 
it's initialized with nothing stored on it. Use 
judgment. 

Finally, we have ourselves a fresh disk. So 
what? If you're not using it to store word proc- 
essing, database, adventure game, or data files 
from other programs, you can use it to 
store programs that you or someone else has on 
another disk. It's really easy. You just load the 
program from the original disk, put your disk in 
the drive, and save the program under any 
name you want. What could be simpler? 

Now let's try it with binary files. Bload a file 
and then try to bsave it. There's that darned

"?syntax error" message again! But wait, we 
know bsave is the command to save binary files; 
is the computer growing senile? No. The com- 
puter's fine; it's those snobbish binary pro- 
grams that are causing such a fuss — they de- 
mand special treatment if you want them to 
behave. 

Each time you load a Basic program, DOS 
puts it in memory so that its beginning is at a 
specific memory location. No matter how big or 
small the program is, it must always begin at the 
same place as other Basic programs. It's the 
same as when you go to the theater to see a 
play; the people who bought cheaper tickets 
(Basic program) begin filling in the balcony 
from front to rear (these are organized people). 

For the next performance, even though 
there are only five people who bought cheap 
tickets (smaller Basic program), the first audi- 
aice clears out entirely. Then the second audi- 
ence b^ins filling in the balcony, also from 
front to rear. Basic programs are nice and 
organized. 

Binary programs, however, are like the peo- 
ple who bought the expensive tickets and sit on 
the orchestra level. Not only are they separated 
from the section of memory where Basic pro- 
grams sit, but they also get reserved seating. 
When binary programs fill the theater, they 
don't fill the rows from front to back because 
they have reserved places. Because of reserved 
seating, binary programs can stay in their seats 
even when other programs enter the theater. 
New arrivals have their own seats. 

What all that means is you can have several 
binary programs in memory at the same time, 
whereas you can have only one Basic program 
in memory at a time. This is where bsave gets 
messy. With all those different binary pro- 
grams in there, how does the computer know 
which one to save, and how does it know where 
one program ends and another begins? It 
doesn't. 

When you use the bsave command, you 
have to tell the computer at which memory ad- 
dress to start reading, and where to stop. So, 
saving a binary program might look something 
like bsave Binary Junk, A$4000, LS2000. The 
specific numbers aren't important right now; it's 
the A$ and L$ that we're interested in here. 

The AS tells the Apple that the following 
number is the address in memory where it's sup- 
posed to start getting information, while the 
number following L$ tells it the length of the 
program, or how far it should go before it stops 
reading information. (We should note here that 
the address 4000 doesn't equal four thousand, 
nor is the length 2000 equal to two thousand. In 
the land of computerdom, numbers with dollar 
signs in front of them are- hexadecimal num- 
bers, another concept we'll get into some other 
time when the wind is right.) 

When you type bsave Binary Junk, AS4000, 
L$2000, the Apple sees bsave and knows the 
program is in binary. Next, it goes to memory ad- 
dress $4000 and reads all the information in the 
next $2000 addresses. After it's done with that, 
it saves everything to disk under the name of 
Binary Junk. 



It's not hard to see from all this talk about 
starting addresses and program lengths that 
transferring binary programs from one disk to 
another can be pretty messy. And if you think 
that's bad, try loading and saving text files. 
Whereas loading binary programs is easy and 
saving them is hard, transferring text files is next 
to impossible for us beginners. 

Lucky for us, there's a program on the Sys- 
tem Master disk called Fid that takes care of fig- 
uring out program addresses and lengths, and 
other hard stuff. And yes, it does transfer text 
files. Fid helps cut down the chance of orors in 
your typing by letting you perform DOS com- 
mands with single keystrokes. You can re- 
name, delete, lock, unlock, verify, and copy files 
just by finding the command you want and typ- 
ing in the corresponding number. 

Fid also saves you a lot of time when work- 
ing with files that have similar names. Suppose 
you have ten text files named Document. 1, 
Document.2, and so on through Document. 10. 
If you wanted to delete them all without Fid, 
you'd have to type 

delete Document. 1< return > 
delete Document.2 < return > 



delete Document. 10 < return > 

Geez, that's a lot of typing. With Fid, when 
it asks you for the name of the file you wish to 
delete, you can just enter Doc= , which tells it to 
delete all files that begin with Doc. Likewise, 
=tion means "delete all files ending with tion," 
and =c= would mean "delete all files contain- 
ing the letter c." 

Before using Fid to copy things, you have to 
have an initialized disk to store things on. If 
you're too lazy to go through the initialization 
process yourself, there's another program on 
the System Master called CopyA (the Applesoft 
version; Copy is the Integer Basic version) that 
not only copies an entire disk for you, but also 
initializes your new disk with the greeting pro- 
gram of the original. It does all the stuff you al- 
ready know how to do, but it eliminates all the 
init, load, and save commands you would nor- 
mally have to type, and it does it faster. 

Storing programs on disk can be a pretty 
risky process if you're not careful. True to com- 
puter form, the Apple doesn't do things the way 
we do. Let's say you write a program that gen- 
erates square roots of numbers and you want to 
save it as Roots. When you save the program, 
the Apple writes the program's name in the 
catalog and then finds an empty spot in stor- 
age space to start writing the program. So far, 
so good. 

Now let's say you write a program a few 
days later that traces your family's genealogy. 
Being an absent-minded human, you forgot 
about the previous program, and you save this 
one also as Roots. Catastrophy strikes. The Ap- 
ple is so anxious to save time that when it looks 
in the disk's catalog and sees you already have a 
program called Roots, it thinks, "Great, Roots is 
already there, so I don't have to find space to

put this; I'll just write it in the same place." The 
answer to the question you're about to ask is 
yes; the square-root program is gone. 

What makes all this even more confusing is 
that even if the first Roots was twenty sectors 
long and the second Roots was just five sectors 
long, the catalog still says Roots takes twenty 
sectors. The reason for this is that when you 
write something on disk for the first time, the 
catalog measures it and knows how much space 
is allocated for it. The next time you save some- 
thing under that name, it remembers how much 
space is reserved for the program, and tells the 
program to go to that location. If you want to 
store the genealogy program as Roots and have 
it show up on the catalog as taking only five sec- 
tors, you have to delete the original Roots first, 
then save the new Roots. 

In this way, the catalog is sort of like a desk 
clerk at a hotel. When the Roots Club re- 
serves a conference room for two hundred peo- 
ple, the desk clerk will direct anyone who comes 
to the desk looking for the Roots conference to 
that room. Suppose the Roots Club finishes its 
meeting and then leaves without telling the desk 
clerk. When Mr. Rex Roots comes to the desk 
and says, "I'm Roots . . ." the desk clerk will di- 
rect him to the conference room, even though 
he only wanted a single for the night. 

Ideally, the clerk should have asked if he 
was with the conference or if he wanted a place 
to sleep. Ideally, the catalog should have asked 
whether or not you want the second program to 
go where the first one is. Ideally, you should 
have checked the catalog to make sure Roots 
wasn't taken already, thus avoiding the whole 
mess. Let's go back to the second ideal. 

Remember those asterisks in front of file 
names in the catalog? Whenever you see one, 
that tells you the file is locked. Locked doesn't 
mean the file is inaccessible; it means you can't 
save anything under that name. You probably 
guessed that the DOS commands you use to en- 
act this safety feature are lock and unlock plus 
the file name. 

If you load a locked program, change it a 
little, and then try to save it under its original 
name, the Apple sees in the catalog that the file 
is locked, and responds, "File locked." If you've 
written a new program and try to save it under a 
name that already exists as a locked file, the 
"File locked" message lets you know that the 
name is spoken for. So, the locking feature is 
nothing more than a way to keep you from ac- 
cidentally erasing valuable files. 

The whole point of all this is that when in 
doubt, you should check the catalog before you 
begin wridng to or changing stuff on your disk. 
It takes a few extra seconds, but it's worth it. 

There's one more way to prevent yourself 
from accidentally writing over important infor- 
mation on your disk, and that's to make it im- 
possible to write to the disk at all. You could 
keep the disk in its paper envelope and never re- 
move it or you could cover up the area on the 
disk where the disk drive reads and writes, but 
that's neither practical nor realistic. 

Fortunately, the disk drive gods put a handy 
device inside the drive called the write-protect 



switch. As you look at your disk, you see a 
small notch cut out. That little cutout is what 
lets the drive know whether it's okay or not to 
write to the disk. When you insert your disk in- 
to the drive, just before it's all the way in, you 
can hear and feel a small click as the disk locks 
into place. That's the write-protect switch pop- 
ping into the notch on the disk. 

When the switch is up, the drive knows it's 
legal to write stuff on the disk; likewise, when 
it's down, the gremlins who do all the writing go 
on coffee break and don't come back until they 
see the switch in the up position again. You can 
protect any disks you load information from 
and never need to write to by sticking on write- 
protect tabs that cover up the disk's notch, thus 
holding the write-protect switch in the down po- 



sition while that disk is in the drive. Now you 
know what those little funny-looking stickers 
that came with your box of disks are for. 

That's the basics of disk storage. Experi- 
ment with Fid and CopyA until you're confident 
with how each one works. If you're ever not 
sure whether or not something will work, the 
best way to find out is to try it and see what 
happens. But make sure you're not messing 
around with any valuable data. If you don't 
have any expendable disks, get someone else's 
and try it on those. Whether it works or not, 
you will have learned something. And if you 
completely destroy data files holding your 
diecking account or yearly budget, you will 
have learned something valuable. 

But learning is what we're here for.

WeVe moved ahead 
a byte in time since 
the Tower of Babel. 
And at least three things 
have improved. 

Here they are: 

Thing Number One: 

Our Communication's Improved. 

With AMPER-MAGIC™ there's no need to know machine lan- 
guage to benefit from its power. 

To your Applesoft™ programs you can attach slick, finished 
machine language routines (referenced by name, not by address, 
no less) in seconds. No separate BLOADing. And then, with 
AMPER-MAGIC commands, you can pass variables back and 
forth directly, just as you would with built-in Applesoft 
commands. 

So, name your routine, perform the append procedure (only 
once please), and AMPER-MAGIC takes over — generating 
machine language speed where it counts: in your programs. 
Even your commercial programs. And, if for some reason you 
want to remove the routine, AMPER-MAGIC can do this too. 

Thing Number Two: 

Our Communication's Improved. 

AMPER-MAGIC also gives you access to hundreds of relocatable 
machine language routines, including those from magazines 
and other libraries, and - most notably - those from AMPER- 
MAGIC itself, which has over fifty routines of its own in two 
volumes. 

Some of AMPER-MAGIC's routines are: 

Find substring Swap variables GOSUB, GOTO a variable 

Speed up Applesoft Input anything Search string array 

And, of course, there are others too, for business, educational, 
recreational and word-process uses. 

With AMPER-MAGIC you attach and access. It's really that 
simple. You can attach an unlimited number of commands to 
any program and you can move any set of commands as a unit 
to any other program. 
A marvelous simplicity, wouldn't you say? 

Thing Number Three: 

Our Communication's Improved. 

Compatible with AMPER-MAGIC you can get the AMPER- 
MAGIC COMMAND LIBRARY. Already available is Volume 
2, which contains twenty-seven machine language routines 
devoted to information displays and output capabilities. 
With Volume 2 you get: a WAIT command, which specifies time 
in ordinary tenths of seconds either as a variable or as an 
expression which can be controlled by the program; the most 
powerful PRINT USING command yet devised; and, of course, 
twenty-five other commands. Future volumes include INPUT 
USING, fancy memory management and various sorting routines. 

Imagine!

Volume 2 Plus shipping. MC and Visa accepted.

Build up* to the 
ultimate challenge. 



If you thought you'd conquered every 
maze on earth, guess again. 

Now there's the Maze Craze 
Construction Set™. The newest and 
greatest challenge of them all. You can 
actually build your own mazes from the 
ground up — and make them as 
mind-boggling as you dare. 

That's only part of the fun. You can 
also create players and menacing 
monsters from your own imagination. 
Or nightmares. And choose speed, 
intelligence and sensitivity too. ^ ;.' 



To get the hang of it, play some of our 
most challenging combinations. Then, 
construct your own and save your 
favorites for future skirmishes. 

Keep your wits about you, though. 
You are not alone. Maze Craze can be 
played with two players in the same 
maze. Try to beat your own game — or 
indulge in a little friendly vengeance 
with an adversary. 

Meet the ultimate challenge: Maze 
Craze. With over a million possibilities, 
it's not likely you'll get bored in this 
century.

MAY 1983 




tyDoBgCarlston. 



Last month we began the design of a program that tracks a person's 
weight over an eleven-week period and then plots the results on the hi-res 
screen. The program mixed text and graphics on hi-res page one, thanks 
to a special machine language subroutine and its data file, both of which 
we poked in and saved as a pair of binary files called Character Gen- 
erator and Character Table. 

Because these two machine language routines occupy the same space 
in memory that an Applesoft program does, we had to force the Apple to 
load the Applesoft program at an address higher than the usual $800. 
We did this by changing the start-of-program pointers in the Apple 
before loading our main program. 

If we were to name our main program Diet, the Diet hello program 
might look like this: 

10 D$ = CHR$($): PRINT D$"BLOAD CHARACTER GENERATOR" 
20 PRINT D$"BLOAD CHARACTER TABLE" 
30 HGR 

40 XX = PEEK ( - 16302) 

50 POKE 103,1: POKE 104,64: POKE 16384,0 

60 PRINT D$"RUN DIET" 

This little program will load in the machine language routines, turn 
on the hi-res graphics, and tell the Apple to load and run the next Ap- 
plesoft program. Diet, up in high memory (above hi-res page one). 

We started designing our main program last month too. Here is our 
progress to date:

3100 RETURN 

As you can see from the menu in lines 3020 through 3040, there are 
three major segments of this program. One permits you to enter new 
data from the keyboard (this is the section we worked on last month). 
The other two permit you to load or save data to disk. We have already 
done this several times in other programs, so it should be pretty routine 
by now. But let's take a look at a solution anyway. There are always a 
few new bells and whistles we can add. 

Let's design the routine to save data to disk first: 

500 VTAB 5: CALL -958: GOSUB 30 

510 PRINT D$; "OPEN";NAME$: PRINT D$; "WRITE";NAME$ 
515 KT = 0 

520 PRINT A%(KT):KT = KT -H 1: IF A%(KT) <> 0 THEN 520 
530 PRINT 0: PRINT D$; '■CLOSE";NAME$ 
540 GOSUB 3000: GOTO 100 

Line 500 jumps to a subroutine (which we'll write in a minute) that 
selects a file name. We are putting this function in a subroutine so that 
we'll be able to select a file name when we retrieve a file as well. If we 
didn't put the code in a subroutine, we'd have to write essentially the 
same code in both sections of the program. 

The subroutine returns the file name to us in a variable called 
NAMES. 

Line 510 opens a file by the name in NAMES and prepares us to 
write to it. Then line 520 prints all of the data from the array A% into the 
text file until it comes across a zero (which we used to indicate the end of 
data). Line 530 then writes that final zero into the text file (so we know 
when we've gotten to the end of it) and closes the file. 

Pretty simple. And the subroutine for entering file names should be 
old hat by now too. We've used it before; 

29 REM " DISK FILE NAME ** 

30 PRINT "ENTER NAME (";: INVERSE : PRINT "RET";: NORMAL : 
PRINT " FOR CATALOG)";: INPUT ": ";NAME$ 

31 IF NAMES = "" THEN PRINT : PRINT D$; "CATALOG": GOSUB 
20: PRINT : GOTO 30 

32 RETURN 

The disk read program is just as simple;

VTAB 5: CALL 
GOSUB 30 
PRINT D$; "OPEN' 
K = 0 

INPUT A%(K): IF A%(K) <> 0 THEN K 
PRINT CHR$(4);" CLOSE";NAME$ 
However, once we've read in the data, we still need to plot it. 
(Perhaps we should have put the data-plotting routines in the data-entry 



;NAME$: PRINT D$; "READ";NAME$ 

K -I- 1: GOTO 200 



MAY 1983 S CO T A L 1^ P 131 



portion of the program into a subroutine so we could have used them 
here as well, but we didn't.) 

220 HCOLOR= 3: HPLOT 28,A%(0): FOR X = 1 TO K - 1: HPLOT 

TO X * 3 + 28,A%(X): NEXT 
230 GOSUB 2000: VTAB A%(X - 1) / 8: HTAB ((X - 1 ) * 3 + 28) / 7 

+ 1: PRINT NAMES 
250 GOSUB 3000: GOTO 100 

Line 220 is a straightforward plot of the data points we've read in. 
However, line 230 is a little added touch. Since we know the name of the 
file we just read in, we can use that name to label the line we've just 
drawn on our graph. So we now go to subroutine 2000, which switches 
printing to the graphics page, and then all that remains is to figure out 
where on-screen to print the variable NAMES. The vtab and htab for- 
mulas in line 230 may look complicated, but they aren't, as long as you 
keep in mind that all text characters are exactly eight pixels (dots) high 
and seven wide. 

There is one more little detail we should add to this part of the pro- 
gram. If someone using this program types a file name incorrectly, the 
program will search the disk for a file that isn't there. Eventually it will 
give up and the program will bomb. 

Having this happen is annoying, particularly when you have some- 
thing on-screen that you don't want to lose by starting over. So let's try a 
little sophisticated error-trapping. The first thing to do is to warn the Ap- 
ple — before it starts searching the disk — that we want to handle error 
messages ourselves: 

180 ONERR GOTO 290 

If any sort of error occurs after the Apple has read line 180, control 
will jump to line 290. No error message will be printed. So it's up to us to 
figure out what is wrong and to advise the program user as to how to 
correct the problem. 

Whenever an error occurs, the Apple places a number indicating the 
type of error in memory location 222. To figure out what's going on, we 
can peek at location 222 and then look up the number in a chart. There 
are two charts in the manuals that come with the Apple hardware. One 
covers Applesoft errors and can be found on page 136 of the Applesoft 
Basic Programming Reference Manual. The other covers DOS errors and 
is located on pages 114 and 115 of The DOS Manual (DOS 3.3). 

Let's not worry about most of the possible errors. What we are look- 
ing for is the file-not-found error, which our chart says is error code num- 
ber 6. If other errors crop up, we'll just have to deal with them 
one by one. 

290 IF PEEK (222) = 5 OR PEEK (222) = 6 THEN PRINT : PRINT 
"FILE NOT FOUND": GOTO 292 

291 PRINT "ERROR #"; PEEK (222) 

292 POKE 216,0: GOSUB 20: GOSUB 3000: GOTO 100 

The important thing about controlling your own error codes is that 
when you've finished notifying the user of the problem, you maintain 
control of the machine and can keep the program running. In this case, 
we'd print an error message, turn off the error flag (that's what the poke 
216,0 does), wait for any key to be pressed, restore the text page menu, 
and then jump to the main menu part of the program. It's a clean 
solution. 

That's the end of the Diet program. May it bring you hours of enter- 
tainment. Now let's get back to basics and take another look at the hello 
program that we had to run before Diet would work. 

In the Diet hello program we loaded in two machine language rou- 
tines, turned on the hi-res graphics, set lomem, and then ran the main 
program. Diet. Whenever you have a large number of administrative 
tasks of this sort, there is an alternative way of handling them, that being 
to use an exec file. An exec file is a text file containing a list of instruc- 
tions from you to the computer. Your Apple executes them one at a time 
until the list is finished. 

Let's create an exec file to run Diet. First, though, let's simplify our 
Diet hello program so that all it does is turn on hi-res graphics and reset 
lomem. Delete lines 10, 20, and 60 and then type save Diet hello. 

Next let's create our exec file. The following Applesoft program will 
write out a text file to the disk. 

10 D$ = CHR$ (4) 

20 PRINT D$"OPEN SETUP": PRINT D$"WRITE SETUP" 



30 PRINT "RUN DIET HELLO" 

40 PRINT "BLOAD CHARACTER TABLE,A4352" 

50 PRINT "BLOAD CHARACTER GENERATOR, A51 20" 

60 PRINT "RUN DIET" 

70 PRINT D$"CLOSE SETUP" 

The text file is called Setup and contains the four commands printed 
in lines 30 through 60. To see how it works, first run the program above 
to create the text file. Then type exec Setup. This command instructs the 
computer to execute the commands in the Setup file one by one until all 
are carried out. It's now possible to create a very simple prehello pro- 
gram that looks like this: 

10 PRINT CHR$(4);"EXEC SETUP" 

One of the most common uses for the exec command is to retrieve an 
Applesoft program that's been captured in a text file. Capturing a pro- 
gram in a text file allows it to be loaded into a word processing program. 
Try this. Load in any Applesoft program, such as the Diet program we 
just wrote. Then add the following line to the beginning of the program: 

1 D$ = CHR$(4): PRINT D$;"OPENPROGRAM": PRINT D$;"WRITE 
PROGRAM": LIST 2,: PRINT D$:"CLOSE PROGRAM": END 

Then run the program. Your disk will whir for a minute and then 
stop. If you catalog the disk, you will discover a new text file on it called 
Program. You can load this file into most word processors, which makes 
it possible to edit programs with all of the powerful features of a word 
processor, such as universal search and replace. Some of Softalk's writ- 
ers use such a system to incorporate programs into their articles, which 
cuts down on errors and keeps them from having to type in the pro- 
grams twice. 

It's even easier to convert a text file back into an Applesoft program. 
Try this. Type new and then list. Your program is gone, right? Now type 
exec program. Type list. Your program has been read back into memo- 
ry. Once you start editing your Applesoft programs on a word proces- 
sor, don't be surprised if you wonder how you ever managed before. 

By now you have been exposed to virtually every command in Ap- 
plesoft — there are only a couple of unusual ones left, and you will pick

them up in the next cx)uple of lessons. In addition, you have started to 
learn a great deal about the internal organization of your Apple and how 
to peek or poke it when you want it to do something Applesoft isn't 
equipped to handle. We have even included a few DOS commands, such 
as the text file open, close, read, write, and exec commands, since DOS is 
such a fundamental part of your programming equipment. 

What remains is practice, and so we'll try over the next few months 
to design a number of useful and interesting programs that give you an 
opportunity to try out the vocabulary you've learned. 

Each month we'll propose a project and analyze it together. The 
following month, we'll offer a solution (not the only one or, for that 
matter, the best) to help if there are any areas that stumped you. And 
we'll occasionally offer short machine language routines that you can 
incorporate into your Applesoft programs to give them enhanced power. 

One of the most basic machine language routines you'll need (at 
least if you write any games) is a sound generator. As you may have read, 
the Apple's speaker can be toggled by any reference to location —16336, 
for example, X = peek ( — 16336). If you reference it repeatedly from 
Applesoft, you can even get sound, in a manner of speaking: 

10 FOR Y = 1 TO 10: S = - 16336: X = PEEK(S) - PEEK(S) + 
PEEK(S) - PEEK(S): NEXT 

If you want to create sounds more sophisticated than these low 
burps, you'll have to have a machine language routine toggle the speaker; 
Applesoft is just too slow. Here is one such routine, poked in from 
Applesoft. 

10 FOR X = 770 TO 788: READ Y: POKE X,Y: NEXT 
20 DATA 173,48,192,136,208,4,198,7,240,8,202,208,246, 
166,6,76,2,3,96 

This program pokes a very short, very simple machine language rou- 
tine into page three of memory (right below the text area). If you'd like to 
see what it looks like, enter the Monitor by typing call —151. You should 
see an asterisk on the left margin where you usually would see the Apple- 
soft bracket. Then type 302L. This is a command to the Apple to list 
whatever is in memory, starting at hex location 302 (the numbers in the 
Monitor mode are all hexadecimal).

numbers you poked into memory. For instance, AD is the hex equivalent 
of 173. To the right, you will find a disassembly of the hex numbers, 
which means that the numbers are converted into simple assembly lan- 
guage commands — that is, three-letter mnemonics that stand for very 
elementary machine language instructions. The first one in this listing, 
LDA, stands for load accumulator. You can find a longer description of 
assembly language and mnemonics in the Apple II Reference Manual. 

Type control-C to get back to Applesoft, and then let's play a little 
with this routine. It works like this. You have to poke a frequency into 
memory location 6 and a duration into location 7. Then you jump to the 
machine language subroutine with a call 770. Try this in direct mode: 

POKE 6,200: POKE 7,200: GALL 770 

You should hear a short, low tone. Try changing the values you poke 
into locations 6 and 7 and see how this alters the note. Then you might 
want to experiment with loops. You can easily get all sorts of interesting 
sound effects. Here are a few examples: 

FOR X = 3 TO 155 STEP 4: POKE 6,X: POKE 7,10: CALL 770: NEXT 

FOR X = 1 TO 5: POKE 6,90: POKE 7,120: CALL 770: POKE 6,180: 
POKE 7,120: CALL 770: NEXT 

FOR X = 1 TO 2: FOR Y = 200 TO 50 STEP - 10: FOR Z = Y + 10TO 
Y - 10 STEP - 3: POKE 6,Z: POKE 7,10: CALL 770: NEXT : 
NEXT : NEXT 

FOR X = 1 TO 15: POKE 6,70 + RND (1) * 50: POKE 7,10: CALL 770: 
NEXT 

You've probably got the hang of it by now. You may find that a few 
good sound effects Uven up even the most serious piece of programming. 

Speaking of which, let's talk about a routine for you to work on over 
the next month. Most of us, at some point, are required to memorize 
large quantities of material. These may be definitions of terms or words 
in a foreign language. One of the most effective ways of learning such 
items is by using flash cards. Each flash card has a word or phrase on 
one side and the definition or translation on the other. You put the cards 
in a pile and run through them. If you correctly define the word or 
phrase, you put that particular card aside. If not, you put it at the back of 
the pile. This way you can study the more difficult ones and put the 
others aside. 

We can write a flash card program on the computer allowing us to 
enter phrases and their definitions and then present them to us, in ran- 
dom order, until we get them right. Such a program will require three 
major sections — one to permit entry of phrases and definitions (and to 
edit them later in case we got them wrong), one to permit us to save the 
lists to disk (or to retrieve them), and one to test us with the list. In short, 
a master menu of functions might look similar to that of the following 
flash card program: 

Edit Functions: 

A(dd words 

R(emove words 

E(dit words 
Disk Functions: 

L(oad from dlsl< 

S(ave to disk 
Study Functions: 

V(iew list 

F(lash cards 

Writing this program will give you ample opportunity to review your 
use of arrays and of string manipulation commands. When you start 
writing the program, start with the parts that will function on their own 
so that you can test them as you go. In other words, first write the main 
menu portion (the part that displays your options and then sends you off 
to the various menu items). Then start with the add-words section, which 
you will need in order to load your arrays with strings. At this point, 
jump down to the view-list option, which is a very simple part but one 
that will allow you to check and see if everything is functioning as it 
should. 

Good luck. Enjoy. Come back next month, and we'll compare 
notes.

tent. Portable air-conditioning units rattle

Outside, the temperature is about a thou-

It's Saturday afternoon, September 4, 
1982. A couple of hundred music enthusi- 
I asts and shade-seekers have jammed into the 
Us Festival's speaker tent to see and hear pres- 
entations by Chick Corea, Herbie Han- 
cock, and Bob Moog. Looking cool as always, 
Herbie Hancock steps up to the front of the tent and 
gives a short, entertaining demonstration of the Fair- 
light digital, computer-controlled synthesizer. 

As he talks about the Fairlight, the alphaSyn- 
tauri, and the Apple, Hancock's great enthusiasm for 
electronic music is apparent. Someone asks Han- 
cock if this means good-bye to acoustic pianos and 
what we've had in the past. 

To which Hancock replies, "No. We're adding to 
what we have. We're not giving up anything. My 
next album is acoustic." But what about the one af- 
ter that?

Two Places at the Same Time. The recording and performing ca- 
reer of Herbie Hancock has been compared to the dual personaUty of 
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde — with Jekyll being the acoustic jazz side and 
Hyde being the funky synthesizer side. Supreme jazz pianist, revolution- 
ary electronic keyboardist, technical innovator, Hancock has influenced 
many contemporary musicians, but he consistently defies classification. 

In his twenty-two-plus years as a professional musician, Hancock has 
played and recorded with George Benson, Paul Desmond, George 
Duke, Carlos Santana, Freddie Hubbard, Chaka Khan, Joni Mitchell, 
Raydio, Wayne Shorter, Keith Jarrett, Quincy Jones, Stevie Wonder, 
Oscar Peterson, Phil Woods, and Oliver Nelson, to name a few. Root- 
ed firmly in jazz, Hancock has built up quite a reputation as an 
experimenter. 

When you realize that this is the same cat who jammed with Miles 
Davis in the sixties, cooked with Chick Corea in the seventies, composed 
two film soundtracks. Blow Up and Death Wish, and recorded recent 
funk and disco albums like Feets Don't Fail Me Now, Magic Windows, 
and Light Me Up, it's clear that this reputation is well earned. 

Hancock's latest album is Quartet, a two-record live performance in 
which he plays acoustic piano. Playing with Hancock are bassist Ron 
Carter, drummer Tony Williams, and trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. Joe 
Blum, in his review of Quartet in a recent issue of Musician, says of Herb- 
ie Hancock's performance: "Hancock emerges marvelously undamaged 
from any of his more commercial ventures." 

A visit with Hancock in his garage-turned-recording studio — sur- 
rounded by a king's ransom worth of synthesizers, recording equipment, 
and computer hardware — brings the man and musician into focus. Cen- 
tered inwardly, following his own mysterious muses, exploring realms 
that more commercially popular (and more pressured) musicians leave 
alone, Hancock is part artist, part devoted Buddhist, and part computer 
jockey. 

Mr. Hands. Hancock is heavily into Apples. In fact, he's some- 
thing of a fiend on the subject. Hancock's bold explorations in search of 
good-sounding synthesizers led him to discover Apples and the alpha- 
Syntauri in the late seventies. Currently Hancock has more than a dozen 
different synthesizers, but he has only one brand of personal comput- 
er — Apple. 

Hancock is just now finishing up a solo, all-synthesizer, all-Herbie 
record. A Saturday afternoon is the only time to catch him at his Bever- 
ly Hills home. In the bottom-floor room of the garage/studio are all the 
instruments — Oberheim, Clavitar, Clavitron, Yamaha, Rhodes, alpha- 
Syntauri, Arp, Fairlight, Sequential Circuits, Moog, Emu, and Lynn. A 
half-million-dollar Trident mixing board (rented) takes up one whole 
wall. There is very little room to move around, but it's just enough. 

Out of this fifteen-by-twenty-foot room comes music that sounds like 
it requires a whole orchestra to play. Drums, bass, brass, strings, key- 
boards, vocals — they're all there, electronically tinged but no less power- 
ful than the real thing. And it all comes from one musician. 

With the help of a custom-built computer patch bay, an Apple II, 
and the never-flagging assistance of sound technician and computer pro- 
grammer Bryan Bell, Hancock has networked (so to speak) all his in- 
struments together so they are playable from one keyboard. The Apple II 
acts as a terminal (they're currently transferring that function to the Ap- 
ple III) to the system, giving Herbie easy access to the electronics of all 
the different instruments. This multiple- keyboard configuration allows 
Hancock to use any "voice" he chooses without having to reconfigure 
and reswitch the equipment and relocate his body each time he wants a 
different sound. 

(A voice is the sound a synthesizer makes. Monophonic synthesizers 
have only one voice. If you hit two keys at once, only one note comes 
out. An eight- voice synthesizer like the alphaSyntauri allows you to press 
eight different keys at once, blending notes as if you were playing a 
piano. A completely polyphonic keyboard is one on which you can press 
all the keys at once and get all the notes.) 

The Analog-to-Digital Blues. Hancock's cache of synthesizers 
ranges from the analog Minimoog and Arp 2600 to the digital Emu and 
Fairlight. Tying all these diverse machines together is a formidable task. 
And it's likely to continue to be a challenge as new synthesizers are in- 
troduced each year. 



"Stevie Wonder has to have two of everything new that comes out," 
Hancock relates with a smile. "It's a game between us — to see who gets 
the newest things first." 

Hancock has spent a lot of money over the years on his electronic 
music quest, and it's really just beginning to pay off He's excited about 
his new album, especially because of the new instruments he's using — the 
Memorymoog, the Fairlight, the Rhodes Chroma, and the Yamaha GS- 
1 . But it's taken hard work from Hancock and a host of others to get 
this far. 

Bryan Bell has been working with Herbie Hancock since 1976. Bell's 
a guitarist, and he's a software and hardware engineer. Herbie's his boss, 
and Bell has worked wonders in pursuit of "Herbie's demand. His need. 
He'd ask me, 'How come it's not like this?' " And Bell would be off writ- 
ing Z-80 code or hand-wiring patches. 

"Herbie has got to have everything. The truth is," Bell says, "no 
one's ever made a synthesizer with the features of next year's product." 
And, Bell adds, there is no industry standard for combining synthe-

tours and keep track of recording budgets. He's developed his own 
programs and subscribes to the Source; and he'll be getting a Lisa later 
this year. 



sizers, drum machines, sequencers, clocks, and all the other attendant 
hardware in the way Hancock wants. 

There are some signs of standardization, with the MIDI multisyn- 
thesizer controller and the Rhodes Chroma, which comes with a stan- 
dard Apple interface. But in 1979, when Hancock and Bell first started to 
combine instruments so they could be played from one keyboard with 
the Apple as a terminal, it was a different story. 

Monster. The first problem Bell tackled was modifying the Emu key- 
board so that Hancock could control any one of his synthesizers through 
its sixteen channels of digital output. This involved increasing the con- 
trol voltage so that the gate output reached a standard that the Ober- 
heim synthesizer could use. 

(In synthesizers, all you're ever dealing with is electricity. It comes 
from the wall and the synthesizer assigns a certain amount of voltage to 
each octave — usually one volt per octave. Hancock uses the Emu like an 
Apple with sixteen expansion slots, sending sequences of notes — volt- 
age — to different synthesizers.) 

In addition to modifying the Emu, Bell built a tuning device that in- 
creased or decreased the voltage coming from the Emu. This permitted 
each voice of all the synthesizers to be tuned independently to a stan- 
dard, so any stock controller could be used. The assignment of channels 
to the various synthesizers was done by hardware patching. Analog en- 
gineer John Vieira of Waves Company helped Bell construct the tuning 
interface for this early configuration. 




MAY 1983 



Bryan Bell shows off Hancock's custom-built, automated patch bay. This 
impressive piece of hardware acts as a digital switching matrix, configuring 
and reconfiguring the patches (interfaces between instruments) for each 
song. 

Hancock and Bell convinced the company that makes the Emu to 
send them a prototype disk drive. They had quickly used up the Emu's 
sequencer memory (the sequencer stores note files — a whole song if you 
want — in the sequence originally played). Eventually, they got a Z-8000 
sixteen-bit master computer for storing note sequences in virtual 
memory. 

Hancock wanted to be able to control all this from a standard Ap- 
plesoft menu. Bell, hardware and software designer Michael Lamer, and 
a mysterious character known only as Universal Patchcord wrote a ton 
of code to make the various machines talk to each other. First they need-

ed a sixteen-bit interface to allow the Apple to talk to the Z-80-based 
Emu and the Z-80(X) master computer. 

Custom FIFOs (first in, first out), basically programmable buffer 
chips, were required in order for the Z-80(X) to handle the signals coming 
from the Emu. They waited "half a year" for them, says Bell. They also 
built an eight-bit, high-speed, bidirectional parallel port for the Z-8000. 
Now 6502 machine language could pass to the Z-8000, instructing it to 
send a sequence of notes to the master clock, which Bell and Vieira had 
built. (A clock controls the tempo of a sequence of notes. A master 
clock is the easiest way to make sure all the instruments play in synchro- 
nization. The voltage comes from the Emu, passes through the master 
clock, and ends up being played automatically on the desired keyboard.) 

Feets Don't Fail Me Now. Hancock and Bell had to seek the serv- 
ices of electronic drum wizard Roger Linn himself to interface the Emu 
and his fancy drum machine, the LM-1. Then they interfaced the Clavi- 
tar and Clavitron portable keyboards to the Apple, with the help of 
Wayne Yentis, who designed those keyboards. During a concert, Han- 
cock just presses a key on the Clavitar, which sends a signal to the Ap- 
ple, which sends a signal to the Emu, which sends a sequence of notes to 
a particular synthesizer. 

One last piece of equipment makes Hancock's system complete, 
more or less, till later in the year. The "automated patch bay" was cus- 
tom-built by Bell and Universal Patchcord. (Patches are what allow one 
piece of equipment to interface with another. You use a patchcord to 
connect a monitor to your Apple. A particular song may require several 
different instruments in a unique setup. The automated patch bay han- 
dles the configuring and reconfiguring of patches for each song.) 

"It's an ultraswank, thirty-two-channels-in, thirty-two-channels-out 
(in stereo), software-driven, digital switching matrix," says Bell. "To the 
Apple it looks like a printer port." 

The voltage from the Emu goes through the automated patch bay 
and is directed to the proper instrument, in much the same way the MIDI 
and Garfield Electronics's Doctor Click Rhythm Controller synchro- 
nize several synthesizers at once. 

The result of all this time and effort (four years and many long 
nights) is what Bell calls "the ultimate composition machine." As such, it 
is contributing significantly to Hancock's creative style. 

"If I hear something in my head, I just play it on the Emu keyboard, 
which stores it in memory. Then I save it on floppies so I can always play 
it back if I want it later," Hancock says. "If I want to make a change in 
the bass tracks, I just tell the program on the Apple to shift to the bass in- 
strument. I change it, then type run, and then it plays it, so there's never 
any need to write anything down. Notation is so cumbersome." 

Hancock might use the Oberheim eight- voice for cellos, the Arp 2600 
for flutes, the Rhodes Chroma for the bass sounds, and so on. Each of 
the different synthesizers has its particular strengths and weaknesses. Va- 
riety is the name of the game. Hancock is especially fond of the Chroma, 
which is touch-sensitive (the harder you press a key, the louder the 
sound). He uses the Emu as the main keyboard because it is a digital con- 
troller for the other instruments. 

New Perspective. Hancock felt the need for a master clock for con- 
trolling the tempo of many different instruments at once and for a cen- 
tral switching device like the automated patch bay long before anything 
resembling these devices was commercially available. Now the music in- 
dustry is starting to wise up. 

The next piece of equipment that Hancock needs for his system is still 
to be delivered. That's a Lisa. The Lisa will replace the Z-8000 computer 
and "is very much part of the picture," according to Bell. 

Eventually programs will be written so that Hancock can use the 
mouse and icon-based software to move from instrument to instrument. 
The Lisa will combine the easy-access terminal function previously per- 
formed by the Apple II and the Apple III with the mass storage and 
high-speed processing of the Z-8000. 

At the moment, Hancock is pursuing a fascination for light pens. The 
Fairlight system comes with a light pen, used to draw wave patterns. (Re- 
member that sound is voltage that comes into the synthesizer as a wave. 
Synthesizers normally come with oscillators for changing the wave 
shape. With a light pjen and a digital synthesizer like the Fairlight, you 
have access to a virtually unlimited range of sounds.)

Light Me Up. "The Fairlight light pen is like a big crayon," Han- 
cock says. He's currently enthralled with the Gibson light pen. "I need- 
ed this one cat [Steve Gibson] for a project. It turns out the guy is a syn- 
thesizer freak. He knew Pat Gleeson and John Vieira. What he's doing is 
fantastic." 

During the past three years, Hancock has become an avid user of the 
Apple II and, more recently, the Apple III. He's spent many fine hours 
working with Neil Konzen's Program Line Editor and many long hours 
battling with program listings in computer magazines. 

"I enter the programs and learn from the experience. If it doesn't run, 
I debug it. But then is it my error or is it in the material? If it's in the pro- 




Hancock is on the leading edge of the electronic music phenomenon. He's 
enthusiastic about computer technology and possesses an active, inquisitive 
mind. He's also willing to learn about new technology and is not afraid to 
experiment. 

gram listing and the debugging doesn't work, I don't know. . . . You feel 
like you've got brain damage." 

Hancock's Apple III is set up on the upper floor of the garage- 
turned-studio. At ease, talking at the computer like it's got a personality, 
Hancock demonstrates his practical, business uses of the Apple III. 
That's right, VisiCalc. 

Hancock is basically a small business (his secretary actually answers 
the phone "Herbie Hancock!"). Hancock has an accountant, a manag- 
er, an agency, and characters like Bryan Bell hanging around. Given 
such a small operation, Hancock, with a little help from the Apple, is 
able to keep very close tabs on the business. Hancock has developed his 
own VisiCalc templates for keeping track of tour and record budgets. 
Sometimes, like on his last tour, knowing so much only heightens the 
misery. 

"Five big concerts fell through, canceled because of unemployment, I 
guess, and the economy," Hancock recalls. "First it looked like we'd lost 



$30,000." Hancock used VisiCalc to plug in up-to-the-minute figures in 
his tour tanplate and knew the bad news long before his accountant did. 

"I imagined what the accountant would say. 'We got troubles!' Then 
we were losing a whole lot more than that. It blew my mind." 

Free Form. "Lots of people are in music to make a profit," Han- 
cock says. "They're after a big gross and are real serious about it." 

One gets the impression that making lots of money is not always Her- 
bie's goal in music or in life. But it takes no small amount of funds to ac- 
cumulate and experiment with all that fancy equipment. Hancock is 
gearing up for a tour to support the new album he's working on. 

Hancock believes that other bands are in a similar situation of hav- 
ing to tour to make money and needing to watch costs carefully. He en- 
visions everybody using computers and sharing information on "cheap 
hotels and good all-night restaurants," among other things. 

Hancock is just plain enthusiastic about the Apple and his ability to 
be in control of his business. He'd like to see more standardization in fa- 
vor of the Apple. "Look at the Chroma from Rhodes," Hancock says. 
"They're owned by CBS and they went with Apple. The Apple's reliabil- 
ity makes it perfect for taking on the road." 

Hancock cites Earth, Wind, and Fire as a band that has found the 
Apple invaluable in several ways. The band has an impressive synthesiz- 
er setup and Bell worked its 1982 U.S. tour. The group also uses the Ap- 
ple for business and for automating the pyrotechnics in its act. 

Hancock has taken the Apple along on previous tours, but his next 
one will be the first for the automated patch bay and the Z-8000 master 
computer. It should be quite an adventure for Hancock and Bell. 

"My dream is to be able to walk into the concert hall with my music 
already playing," Hancock muses. "I'd just sit down and join in." 

As it is, with the automated patch bay, Herbie will simply press a key 
on the Apple's keyboard before each song and all of the patches will oc- 
cur automatically. Hancock uses a vocoder (which analyzes voice char- 
acteristics and uses them to control an input sound — like a synthesiza- — 
and filters it to sound like your voice) for most of his vocals, and this too 
will be patched through the system. What is normally a hassle — physical- 
ly repatching instruments for each song — Hancock and Bell won't have 
to worry about. 

"When we go on the road we have tons of backup equipment," says 
Bell. "Spare Apples, spare disk drives, even an extra vocoder." 

Master Telecommunicator. At home or on the road, Hancock is a 
frequent user of the Source. He sees big things in telecommunications. If 
you can send sequences of notes from one synthesizer to another, why 
can't you send them all the way across the country? 

"You know, as long as we had the same equipment, I could send 
sounds to Stevie Wonder by modem. Eventually you'd have a library of 
sounds." Herbie's getting way out there now. "You could also have 
concerts or jam sessions by modem with musicians in Florida and New 
York." Stay tuned. 

Bell is pleased with the support he's gotten from Apple Computer. 
"Apple is laying the groundwork for a personal computer revolution. 
Getting microcomputers into the hands of someone like Herbie really 
makes sense." 

Bell will no doubt have his hands full when Hancock's Lisa arrives. 
He does not call himself a "kill" programmer. "I'm bad at 6502 and Z-80 
machine language. I try to design the concepts and depend on Michael 
Lamer for the machine codes." 

Thrust. They say that computers are the first thing that has really ex- 
cited Herbie Hancock since he discovaed jazz at age seventeen. 

Some people might still be mad at him for moving away from acous- 
tic piano, even if it's only temporary, but Hancock's an innovator and he 
sees electronic music as a supreme challenge. 

"We're not robots. Take a drum machine. There the technology is 
taking us away from slavery. 

"People say to me that I'm putting orchestras out of work and tak- 
ing away jobs. You know, it is possible for a piano player to learn to play 
a synthesizer." Look at Hancock. 

But not right now. He's busy finishing up his album, the first he's re- 
corded at his home. It's scheduled for release later this year. If you like 
funky pop and dance music, with generous portions of jazz thrown in for 
spice, then Herbie's the man with the music.

Unless otherwise noted, all products can be assumed to run on either Apple

The Composer's Assistant. By Kentyn Reynolds. Two technofantasies 
keep recurring to musicians. The first is that it will someday be possible 
to produce music by brain waves alone, without having to play an instru- 
ment of any sort; the second is that it will be possible to derive a score in 
conventional musical notation directly from a musical performance, 
without having to go through the arduous task of writing the music out 
by hand. The brain-music fantasy is doomed to remain imaginary, ex- 
cept perhaps for some specialized types of experimental music. The auto- 
matic score-generating problem, on the other hand, has been addressed 
by a host of computer music researchers. As a result, several score-writ- 
ing programs now exist. Among the more recent of these is The 
Composer's Assistant. This software package enables music keyboard 
performances played on the alphaSyntauri computer music system to be 
printed out as conventionally notated, hi-res scores. 

Syn-Dump, a printer initializer disk, derives the control codes that 
your printer needs to generate the graphics and embeds them in the 
score-writing software. 

Next, the musician uses either the Alpha Plus or the Metatrak soft- 
ware to record a keyboard performance. Recording for score generation 
requires a somewhat different playing technique than recording for 
listening. Begin by selecting a tempo at which the music can be played ac- 
curately, then turn on the software metronome; this provides the time 
reference for the score-writing. The metronome clicks from the Apple's 
internal speaker. Using Metatrak, any mistakes can be corrected by 
"punching in." If the music score is longer than a thousand notes, it 
should be divided into two or more performance files. 

Enter score-formatting information by using key and time signa- 
tures, metronome setting, and timing resolution. The program reads the 
performance file, then calculates each note's starting time and duration. 
These calculations are stored in an analysis file. 

The graphics-generation routine works from the analysis file. You 
may look at the score on the monitor, one measure at a time. At this 
point, lyrics, titles, and performance instructions may be added to the 
score, directly from the Apple's keyboard. When all text is entered, the 
score is ready to be printed. The staves are printed vertically down the 
paper. All measures are the same length; notes and rests within a meas- 
ure are precisely spaced in time. With an Epson MX- 100 it takes slightly 
more than a minute to print out one measure of music. Graphic symbols 
are defined to a resolution of one matrix dot. Thus the printout, al- 
though slow, produces easy-to-read music. 

The Composer's Assistant accurately measures note timing and dura- 
tion and follows a complex set of rules and algorithms to format the 
score. However, the final products differ in several ways from tradi- 
tional sheet music. Series of eighth and sixteenth notes are printed with 
separate stem flags, instead of one continuous bar. Notes of a given time 
value are always the same distance apart, whether or not there are acci- 
dentals (sharps and flats) between them. All note stems point up, and all 
note bodies are on the same side of the stem. The differences detract 
somewhat from the readability of some scores, especially scores of dense, 
rhythmically complex material. On the other hand, exact spacing of 
notes and rests and markings indicating all metronome beats are aids to 
readability that don't exist in conventional scores. 

The Composer's Assistant is a useful tool for assistance in performing 
a job that is often complex and difficult. Like any other tool, using it 
looks simple at first glance but it takes practice to master. It doesn't cor- 



rect playing mistakes, compensate for sloppy timing, or make similar 
musical decisions in your favor. Neither does it exercise artistic judg- 
ment to stretch and bend the rules under which it works. It transcribes 
accurately executed keyboard performances and spotlights exactly what 
is wrong with less-than-perfect playing. As such. The Composer's 
Assistant is a powerful addition to the alphaSyntauri's extensive musical 
repertoire. RH

Kaleido-Sound. By Robert McNelly. Do you remember the days of 
speakers that came with color boxes? The kind that flashed different col- 
ors, depending on the pitch and intensity of the music being played? Ka- 
leido-Sound is from the company that developed the Soundchaser Music 
System keyboard synthesizer for the Apple. Kaleido-Sound is the Ap- 
ple's answer to those visual stimuli popular years ago. 

By connecting the audio output of a stereo system to the Apple, vari- 
ous patterns are generated on the monitor screen in sync with the music 
being played. The visual effects range from lo-res kaleidoscopic pat- 
terns to graceful hi-res colored bubbles that pulsate in time with the 
sound. You can limit the colors to suit any theme and control the re- 
sponse time of the graphics to the sound. 

The patterns vary according to the type of music being played. Clas- 
sical music tends to produce very fluid patterns; modern music of the 
heavily amplified variety can produce sharp bursts of intense color. 

Kaleido-Sound is a sensual enhancement of music. It engages more 
than your sense of hearing for enjoying music. When was the last time 
you watched Beethoven's Fifth? DA

Music Maker. By Jim Baldridge. Music Maker makes it easy to tran- 
scribe musK into song files that can be played through an Apple's built-in 
speaker. Although its capabilities are somewhat limited for playing 
multipart music, the final results sound very good indeed. You can 
realize much better sound quality by choosing the cassette port option 
and playing the music through a stereo system or tape recording it. 

The program is comprised of several modules, all residing in mem- 
ory during use. Thus you can play a piece you're composing at any time, 
even while entering or editing. As the piece is playing, a display shows the 
current note number and all the parameters of that note. Stepping 
through the notes one by one makes it easy to spot errors, even in long 
works or very fast passages. 

The editing program works a lot like a word processor. The notes are 
numbered automatically and any changes due to insertions or deletions 
are reflected immediately. You can alter the tempo any time for the 
whole or for sections, but you must choose the key in advance. You can 
plan to have the piece change key in the middle; all subsequent note en- 
tries will have the appropriate accidentals added automatically. 

Tempo note values can range from whole notes through 256th notes. 
The range of possible frequencies is equally impressive, beginning at low 
F on the bass clef and continuing to F sharp an octave above the treble 
clef. Triplets and even quintuplets are available, too. When you enter 
dotted notes in a row, you don't have to add the dot each time. 

A well-written instruction manual contains a minicourse for those in- 
experienced in the use of musical terms. Also included are complete 
instructions for using song files from within programs in Applesoft, Inte- 
ger Basic, or machine language. A special assembler enables the song to 
be run as a standalone module, independent of the Music Maker 
program. 

Being able to repeat portions of a song is a super feature of Music

Maker. It can save hours of entering long, redundant passages, yet this 
feature is lacking on other, more expensive composing aids. Less useful, 
though no less impressive, is the Kaleidoscopic Maestro module, which 
creates a visual color display in step with the music. 

The only drawback to this program is its method for creating multi- 
part harmony. Chords must be approximated by the use of arpeggiation 
or other single-note patterns; they come aaoss with a honky-tonk flavor. 
Several excellent demos on the disk illustrate the best use of this 
technique. EW

High Rise. By Joe Calabrase. In the last couple of years, a marvelous 
educational game has been making the circuit of finer toy stores. The 
game involves a multitude of wooden blocks, each of a different wood, 
color, and shape. The shapes vary widely. Some are the regular cubes, 
cylinders, and rectangular blocks; others are very strange. One odd shape 
perches at an angle on the side of another odd-shaped piece. 

The object of the game is to build a tower; the player who adds a 
piece that causes the tower to collapse loses. Because of the varying 
woods and shapes, the pieces have different weights and centers of grav- 
ity. In the process of constructing block towers, a child learns to differ- 
entiate subtle variations in shape and weight and gains a sense of pro- 
portion and balance. 

High Rise from Micro Lab expands on and computerizes this de- 
lightful game. A warehouse worker attempts to build a rickety structure 
of oddly shaped boxes high enough that, when he climbs it, he can reach 
a ladder in the rafters. He selects one shape at a time from four self-feed- 
ing chutes. As he takes a shape out, a different shape slides into place. 
The man then carries his crate to a hydraulic spring and carefully posi- 
tions it on the wide-spring platform, which can accommodate several dif- 
ferent widths at once. When he's satisfied with the arrangement, he re- 
leases the spring, and the crates rise in a graceful arc and land in corre- 
sponding positions on the soaring edifice. When the highest point of the 
structure reaches the ladder, the man scrambles up the crates and the lad- 
der to reach the next level. 

The complexity of the game increases and a time limit for building 
the structure decreases with each level. The new crates on each level as- 
sume more and more bizarre shapes. Determining how to put the pieces 
together in such a way that the structure is stable stretches the ingenuity 
of the player. 

High Rise is being marketed primarily as an educational shape-learn- 
ing game for children and it's an excellent one; but the pace and scope of 
the game are well enough done to absorb most adults. People who enjoy 
solving challenging puzzles will find excitement and delight in each 
new level.

What's Where in the Apple. By William F. Luebbert. It is a fairly uni- 
versal axiom that the more you learn about anything, the more you real- 
ize you don't know. If you're an Apple programmer, struggling to gain 
control of a rapidly changing, complex environment that didn't even 
exist a decade ago, you may find this to be a frustrating truth. Particu- 
larly when the reference books begin to procreate before your eyes and 
you can't remember where to find that reference to DOS bload address 
memory locations. 

A well-organized reference like What's Where in the Apple can be just 
the thing when the amount of information needed to complete a major 
programming project becomes overwhelming. The book consists of three 
sections. The Atlas is a Ust of all the meaningful locations in the Apple II 
indexed in hexadecimal (with decimal equivalents) by memory location. 
There are thousands of such locations, including all the zero-page pointers, 
I/O hooks, and Monitor, DOS, Applesoft, and Int^er routines. 

The Gazetteer section is the same hst indexed by the standard name 
for the location or routine, such as the often used COUT and KEYIN 
and the more obscure BXSAV. The Atlas and Gazetteer sections are 
completely cross-referenced, and each item in the Ustings contains a brief 
description of the function of whatever is at that location. The Atlas sec- 
tion, by giving a meaning to all those anonymous hex numbers, is great 
for someone trying to understand an unfamiliar machine language dis- 
assembly. The Gazetteer is more useful for a programmer who knows 
the various internal locations and routines by name but doesn't know 
offhand where to find them. 

An earlier version of the book consisted almost solely of these two 
sections, and in and of itself it was a powerful reference tool for the pro- 
grammer. The most recent update, however, also contains twenty chap- 
ters that would be of further use to anyone attempting to write advanced 
applications. The early chapters contain comprehensive discussions of 
the various uses of peeks, pokes, and calls. This isn't a simple list of vari- 
ous specific commands and what they do, like the one in Appendix J of 
the Applesoft manual, but an encyclopedic treatment of advanced uses 
for such commands. For instance, the poke section includes a descrip- 
tion of how to do a double poke — that is, to poke a sixteen-bit address 
into two consecutive bytes of memory. 

The more advanced chapters discuss the hi-res memory layout, ma- 
chine language addressing modes, how the Applesoft interpreter works, 
and useful but hard-to-find aspects of DOS and the Monitor. For those 
who bought the earlier edition of What's Where, the new section is avail- 
able in a separate edition called The Guide.

What's Where in the Apple is not for the beginner. It will by no means 
teach programming. What it will do for anyone who already pro- 
grams — from the tenderfoot just beginning to understand how much 
there is to know to the Eagle scout who knows too much to keep track of 
it all — is provide a wealth of information in an accessible format. DD 
What's Where in the Apple, by William F. Luebbert, Micro Ink (34 Chelmsford 
Street, Box 6502, Chelmsford, MA 01824; 617-256-5515). $24.95. 

S.A.M. By Mark Barton. The acronym stands for Software Automatic 
Mouth, but it should be stated at the outset that to use S.A.M. with the 
Apple you need some hardware, which is included. This isn't a speech 
synthesizer chip but is instead a simple digital-to-analog converter, which 
accounts for the relatively low price of the product. S.A.M. seems to 
have been created first for the Atari, which has the necessary hardware 
built in. 

The caveats aside, most of the credit for S.A.M. goes to software. By 
itself, a D-to-A converter can make some interesting noises, but speech 
requires some sophistication. S.A.M. does a good job of making the con- 
verter's buzzes, clicks, and tones sound like a voice. 

There are two different machine language modules included, both of 
which can be called from Basic programs or from other machine lan- 
guage ones. One program takes phonetic input, for example, 
"kumpyuw3ter" for "computer." The second operates from normally 
spelled English text, interpreting it with standard pronunciation rules. 
The second program has some difficulty with oddly spelled words, of 
which there are many in English. The translating software also takes up 
about 6K of memory in addition to the 9K or so used by the synthesizer; 
so if you want to do anything serious, you have to get used to the pho- 
netic alphabet. 

In an old joke about Henry being spelled "Hen3ry," the three is si- 
lent. For S.A.M., the three denotes the stress on the syllable. Any digit 
from one to eight after a syllable (in the phonetic spelling) will accent that 
syllable accordingly. This gives S.A.M. a nice human quality. 

S.A.M. is highly recognizable in two senses — it's reasonably intelli- 
gent, and when you hear it speak you know it's S.A.M. and not some 
other speech synthesizer. 



PEN-PAL"" is the new word processor that maximizes your out- 
put. For home or business PEN-PAL gives you the flexibility you 
need to do all of your writing. From memos to manuscripts, from 
reports to recipes you produce professional results. 

At $59.95 PEN-PAL is your best buy. Functions found in more 
expensive word processors can be found in PEN-PAL — like: 

• 5 help "menus" for display 

• Horizontal scroll to 254 characters 

• 40 and 80 column formatting 

• Automatic page numbering and heading 

• Centering and left and right justification 

• Block copy moves, store and delete 

• Global word search, replace and delete 

• Accepts 16K RAM card to increase file storage 

• 2 display modes (editing and formatting) 



You see, S.A.M. has a foreign accent. There's a just-off-EUis-Island 
quality to its voice that's hard to pin down to any specific ethnic group. 
One listener will detect a strong Russian accent, another will swear it's 
more like Swedish. Knock up the pitch and it's Count Dracula doing a 
Monty Python falsetto. 

Perhaps S.A.M. is the key to the next generation of synthesized 
speech. In a few years, maybe we'll be able to control the accent. DD

Transtar 130. The wonderful thing about computers and their ac- 
cessories in today's economy is that their prices tend to fall rather than 
rise. Daisy wheel printers have been slower than most peripherals to fol- 
low this trend; until recently any daisy wheel costing less than a thou- 
sand dollars has been of suspect quality. But Transtar's new printer, at 
$895, is an attractive and dependable machine. 

At sixteen characters per second, the Transtar won't win any races 
with a dot-matrix printer, but it's in the normal range for daisy wheels. It 
offers ten or twelve characters per inch or proportional spacing, and 
standard print wheels are available in a number of typefaces for all three 
of these options. 

Two features you might expect to find only on more costly printers 
are automatic paper load and settings for variable paper thickness. The 
paper load makes life a lot easier. Just set the paper up on the platen, 
touch a button, and the paper glides into place at the top of the page — or 
one, one and a half, or two inches down, depending on dip-switch set- 
tings. The paper thickness can be set from one to four sheets by moving a 
lever that has a very fine control over the distance from the print head to 
the platen. 

The Transtar does lack two features that are common on dot-matrix 
printers and not unheard-of on daisy wheels. They are tractor feed and 
bidirectional printing. Unidirectional printing affects the speed and little 
else. Friction feed is usually okay at a daisy wheel's slower speed. Paper 
sometimes shifts one way or the other, but it usually isn't noticeable un- 
less you're printing ten or twenty pages at a shot. 

The sounds a printer makes are very telling, and usually they can in-

fluence the way you feel about the machine as much as all the other fac- 
tors. The word clunker doesn't connote a cheap piece of equipment for 
nothing. The Transtar sounds clean. The even tapping of its hammer is 
almost restful next to the high-pitched wail some dot-matrix printers 
make. But the other noises are important too. The hum of carriage 
movement, the smooth, sliding sound of the line feed, and the distinct 
click when the print wheel fits into place give the satisfying feel of a pre- 
cise piece of equipment. 

The Transtar's performance bears this out. And it does graphics 
too. DD

Ken Uston's Professional Blackjack. By Jack V. Briner, Jr. Blackjack is 
unique among casino games in that it is the only game in which a skillful 
player can consistently make money. About twenty years ago, enterpris- 
ing mathematicians used computers to determine just the best way to 
play every possible blackjack hand. To their amazement, they were able 
to devise a simple basic system that, theoretically, could beat the house. 
These avaricious savants headed straight for Vegas and made a substan- 
tial amount of money— just to prove their theory correct. Several of 
them made even more money by publishing books about their system. 

The end result, after much confusion, was that the Vegas casinos 
changed their rules to restore their edge against basic system players. Un- 
fortunately for the casino execs, the mathematicians, joined by hordes of 
computer programmers, had come up with an even more powerful strat- 
egy. They noticed that as cards were used in the play of hands the char- 
acter of the deck changed; it would constantly swing between being 
favorable to the house and favorable to the player. For example, if all 
four aces have been played, then no one can get a blackjack. This is un- 
favorable to the player, who gets paid extra for them. By keeping track of 
the cards that have been played, it's possible for the knowledgeable play- 
er to detCTmine wlien the deck is favorable and bet more in those situa- 
tions, thus magnifying the effect of the favorable situation and gaining an 
edge on the house. Such players are known to casinos as "$#©$%!! card 
counters." 

Ken Uston is one of the top ten blackjack players in the world; he's 
so feared by casinos that he is barred from playing in almost every ca- 
sino in the world where card counting is illegal. In Atlantic City, where 
counting is legal, casinos have been known to pay him to put on demon- 
strations; they figure it's cheaper. Ken has written several books on 
blackjack and the blackjack life. The best of these is Million Dollar 
Blackjack, probably the most comprehensive collection of strategies and 
anecdotes about blackjack in existence. 

Professiorud Blackjack attempts to teach three of the strat^ies found 
in the book. Which one you should learn depends on what your objec- 
tives are: If you want to have a good time and not lose too much money, 
you should learn a basic strategy. If you want to have a good time and 
not lose any money, you should learn a "simple plus/minus" card-count- 
ing strategy; and if you want to work at it and make some money, you 
should learn the "Uston Advanced Point Count" strategy. 

A molded plastic case holds the disk and two manuals. The first man- 
ual tells you how to use the program; it's the one negative aspect of the 
package. This less-than-comprehensive manual is very skimpy and seems 
to have been written with the assumption that the program is so self- 
documenting that the manual would never have to be read. Well, the 
program is almost that self-documenting — but not quite. Still, the qual- 
ity of the program more than compensates for the sketchy instructions. 
The program is menu-oriented and very easy to use and understand. 

The second, much larger manual provides an introduction to black- 
jack and an explanation of the three strategies. Color-coded charts for 
each strategy are so neat that a smart cookie could do a brisk business 
just selling the charts in the bookstores. 

The program itself is a delight to the blackjack student. At the gam- 
ing table, six other players can be controlled by the player or the com- 
puter. Computer players use one of the three strat^ies, and the program 
monitors your decisions and tells how correctly you played according to 
the strategy you've chosen to work on. Just for fun, you can also opt to 
use your own strategy and see how it does. 

Stored on the disk are the rules for just about every casino in the

United States, with all their variations. This is one of the best features of 
the program; you get the feel of play at the Playboy in Atlantic City or 
Caesars in Vegas. And you can finely tune your playing strategy for the 
specific casino in which you'll be spending your vacation. If the rules 
change at the casino, the stored rules can be modified; you can even in- 
put an entirely different casino — crucial for all of us planning frequent 
weekends in Monte Carlo. 

Although this package costs more than many other blackjack pro- 
grams on the market, it's well worth the price to anyone seriously inter- 
ested in learning how to play blackjack. The program will earn its keep in 
a few hours in the casino, if the player spwnds a few hours studying at 
home. See you at the tables! RW

Black Jack Strategy. By Norman J. Wazaney, Jr. Black Jack Strategy 
presents a basic, "no frills" approach to blackjack, mostly designed for 
the novice; this is its strongest feature. Neophytes who enjoy playing 
blackjack still don't like losing. The casinos, of course, love them; casual 
players provide the bulk of the casinos' revenues. But even the average 
player can strike back. 

Black Jack Strategy comes with a basic strategy installed into the 
program. It allows development of new basic strategies, simulates those 
strategies over many hands of play, tutors players by presenting sample 
situations and monitoring responses, and allows players to experience the 
feel of head-to-head competition with casino dealers. 

The program's only weakness is that it can teach you only a basic 
strategy; it doesn't provide for advanced techniques such as card count- 
ing. In fact, the author remarks that "card counting, even where legal, 
will soon cease to be a viable betting strategy." But right now, it is. There 
isn't a single casino in the world where you cannot make money count- 
ing cards (although some casinos offer much more favorable rules than 
others). But the author's philosophy makes most of this program of lit- 
tle use to serious players. 

The program does what it says it will do for the beginning player, and 
it does it very well. The graphic displays are attractive and well thought- 
out. The manual is in a stand-up binder that's a real aid to learning. 
Black Jack Strategy is terrific for people who are casually interested in 
blackjack.

Logic Simulator/ Logic Designer. By Andrew V. Thompson. One of the 
most tedious aspects of digital electronic design work is building and test- 
ing the prototype circuit. Even with a well-stocked parts drawer and a 
bench full of the latest test gear, there is simply no getting around the 
chore of assembling all of the components together and trying to make it 
work properly. If only there were some way to enter the proposed circuit 
into a computer and have it do the dirty work of checking signal flow 
and logic before plugging in the soldering iron! 

The Logic Series from Spectrum Software does exactly that, in less 
time and with a whole lot less hassle. This package is comprised of two 
disks: one containing an interesting, fast-paced demo of what the pro- 
grams can do, and the other containing the actual designer and simula- 
tor programs. The Logic Designer module allows drawing a circuit in 
schematic form by placing the various gates and flip-flops on a gridded 
pattern on the CRT. The appropriate inputs and outputs are then joined 
together in a connect-the-dots fashion to complete the final circuit. The 
completed circuit is automatically saved to disk before being analyzed 
with the Logic Simulator module. 

The simulator is where the testing of the final circuit design takes 
place, and it allows an elaborate series of predefined binary signals to be 
applied to as many as eighteen input points, or nodes. The seventy out- 
put nodes to be monitored are also specified by the user. The resultant 
ones and zeros are listed on either the CRT screen or a printer. 

One of the major features of the Logic Simulator module is that the 
screen drawing phase of entering a schematic may be bypassed entirely if 
desired. The arrangements of the digital building blocks may be entered 
directly instead. This has the decided advantage of speeding up the en 
tire process considerably, since the computer doesn't need to see a draw- 
ing of the circuit to understand how it works. 



When entering data this way, the designer must draw out the circuit 
by hand and assign node numbers to each input, output, and connec- 
tion point. These are then entered into the computer as a series of tables 
prior to running a simulation. When a bug is found (there's always a 
bug!), the connection tables may be edited and the simulation run again. 

Another powerful feature of the Logic Series is its ability to recog- 
nize user-defined subassemblies, or macros. When designing digital logic 
circuits, it is not uncommon to have many repetitive building blocks 
within one larger circuit. By predefining these macros, the user may re- 
call a fairly elaborate array of interconnected gates with only one or two 
keystrokes. In fact, since the Logic Series does not support certain cir- 
cuit elements such as counters, the only practical way to include them in- 
to the final design would be to organize the necessary gates and flip-flops 
ahead of time. Then call them up when needed. The same holds true for 
gates with more than three inputs; the user must first assemble the re- 
quired device from smaller blocks. 

Unquestionably, the Logic Series can be a timesaver, especially when 
attempting to analyze a large and complex circuit arrangement. For digi- 
tal designs using a half dozen components, though, it may be faster just 
to build the whole thing the usual way. For one component, it is still 
rather a lengthy process. The grid system of drawing makes lining up the 
various inputs and outputs easier than it is with some other methods. 
The program is fairly disk-intensive, and a designer may become impa- 
tient waiting to get from one menu to another. Perhaps most exasperat- 
ing is being asked time and time again, "Which drive will you be using 
for your data disk?" One would think that answering once should be 
enough. 

With a capacity for one thousand gates, sixteen shift registers, six- 
teen separate user-defined macros, and more, the Logic Simulator is in- 
deed a formidable piece of software. Spectrum is to be commended for 
successfully completing such a task. EW

Pro Poker. By Jay Allen. Pro Poker is just that professional. It's by far 
the best poker program for the Apple. Pro Poker allows you to play five- 
card draw, jacks or better, with wild card. Eight players can play at once; 
with less, computer opponents fill out the table, and these are some of the 
toughest computer players ever seen. They play hard and fast, and they 
even bluff correctly. If you don't play tight, you might even lose your 
shirt to these electronic cardsharps. The computer is even programmed 
to analyze your playing style in an attempt to "read" you. 

Pro Poker, apart from being a fun game, is also a teaching tool. Jay 
Allen is a poker professional who has authored several books on gam- 
bling techniques. The game even has a kibitz mode that gives meaning- 
ful advice on what to do at any point and explains why it thinks its ad- 
vice is correct. An option allows the player to watch the computer play 
all hands face-up, so you can see what other players are doing and why. 

The program runs very fast and is self-prompting. It will deal an 
astonishing three hundred hi-res hands per hour. 

A minor addition would enhance the game a little. Pro Poker plays 
silently. A bit of atmosphere — the slap of the cards and the clink of the 
chips — would be fun. 

But Pro Poker is loaded with little touches that make it a dream to 
use — for instance, automatically organizing your hands to make them 
more readable! It's an excellent program that no budding cardsharp 
should be without. Only hope that you never wind up in a real game with 
its author! RW

other. There are six cannons on each side of the ships. Firing all six can- 
nons at once is a full broadside. Subsequent damage reduces firepower, 
so players must maneuver to bring their ships' best sides to bear on the 
enemy. Likewise, the speed of a ship and its ability to turn swiftly 
changes as masts are lost during combat. If all three masts are blown 

I away, the ship just drifts. A crafty commander can pretend to lie still in 
the water, only to come to life when a reckless foe goes in for the kill. 
Ramming is possible and quite effective. As the ship rams, it can fire 

I broadsides point blank into the enemy, doing devastating damage. Wary 
skippers are careful not to hit the enemy ships' powder magazines when 

; their own ships are close in. If the magazine is hit, the ship blows up in a 

i fiery hi-res display. The range of the explosion destroys both ships if they 

, are too close together. 

Fog plays a large role in this game, but it's a strange aspect of the 
simulation. Instead of providing fog banks on-screen to confuse the 
ships, the program declares that everything off-screen is fog. The players 

I are provided with fragile compasses to help guide their ships back on- 

i screen. If a ship stays too long in the fog, it is considered lost forever. 
This is the hardest playing aspect of the game to learn. The ships turn so 

I ponderously that it's very difficult to keep them on-screen all the time. 
Once off the screen, even with the compass, determining the proper 
course on which to return is no small feat. Many a battle may be won 
just by forcing your opponent into the fog. 

! The superb packaging is part of the new Xerox look. The soft plas- 

I tic-covered binder contains bonuses. There's a large poster of a famous 
painting depicting the 1812 naval engagement between the USS Consti- 
tution and the HMS Java, and there's a finely done Old Ironsides Log 
Book for chronichng the outcome of many encounters. 

The game can be played by two people or by one person against the 
computer. 

While Old Ironsideshas a certain arcade feel to its play, it's basically a 
game of skill and strategy. Families looking for games to share would do 
well to look into this delightful program. RRA

! Apple Bunny. Apple Bunny is a neat, quick, little piece of hardware for 
which we have a neat, quick, little review. 

Apple Bunny gives your Apple II or II Plus (no need for it on the He) 
the capability of auto repeat on all keys. The device's greatest virtue is 

i that there isn't much to say about it. It can be installed in about a min- 

' ute; it has eight Uttle prongs that snap onto eight of the twenty-five pins 
that project from the keyboard just inside the Apple's cover. It doesn't 
conflict with the standard shift-key modification. 

Another nice thing is that Apple Bunny doesn't lock you into having 
repeating keys. In some arcade games, auto repeat can be particularly 
unhealthy. On the Bunny, auto repeat toggles on and off to the simul- 
taneous press of control and shift. Since it reads the keyboard pins di- 
rectly, no strange software configurations can disable it, and control-shift 
is such a strange bird that it doesn't affect the operation of most pro- 
grams. We did note that the control-shift commands in ScreenWriter II 
turned the Bunny off and on inadvertently. 

When Apple Bunny is on, it doesn't keep you waiting. When you type 
normally at a key, it doesn't repeat, but hold the key down three-quar- 

I ters of a second and it starts to repeat at about the speed the Apple re- 
peat key would cause. The three-quarter-second wait is just about right — 
short enough to get you moving when you want to move, but long 
enough that it won't start to repeat when you're not expecting it. 
You see? There really isn't much to talk about. Another thing about 

. which there isn't much to say is the price. And that's nice too. DD

ORCA/M. By Mike Westerfield. In the grand scheme of things, you 
might wonder if there really is a need for another Apple assembler. Quite 
a few already exist, and assembly language programmers are not the 
largest subgroup of Apple owners that Hayden, or anyone else, might 
want to address at this point. So why ORCAl 

ORCA is an assembler for programmers who have grand schemes. 
Sure, you might use it to impress your friends with your knowledge of as- 
sembly or to speed up your Basic programs with short machine Ian- 



152 



MAY 1983 



guage subroutines. It is no worse for that sort of thing, if no better, than 
any other assembler. 

But ORCA's true destiny is to assemble creations of the greatest sort: 
programs so big we don't even tend to think of them as programs but 
rather as part of the soul of the machine. Big programs referred to with 
big words are something we always tend to capitalize in our minds; 
Operating Systems, Interpreters, Compilers, Languages. Systems pro- 
gramming! Certainly ORCA can apply as well to other major undertak- 
ings, such as word processors, spreadsheets, databases, assemblers. 
ORCA would be a good assembler to get you started on the Great 
American Arcade Game (that eighties answer to the Great American 
Novel) you've been meaning to write. 

ORCA has enough features to keep three utilities and a word proces- 
sor happy as well as a macro assembler. The command level, which they 
call the Monitor (and with some justification), is the most extensive we've 
seen on any assembler. The wild-card character from the Fid program is 
available on most DOS commands in ORCA, so for instance you can 
ask for a catalog of all the file names on the disk that contain some com- 
mon string (such as mac, to get a list of macro routines available). You 
can swap files, alphabetize the catalog of a disk, or restore deleted files, 
provided they haven't been overwritten. There's even a disk track and 
sector editing utility. We can't even list all the functions of the ORCA 
Monitor in the space of a review, but we offer these examples as evi- 
dence of Westerfield's attention to detail. 

The editor is as extensive as the Monitor. In the first place, it frees the 
user from the bonds of line numbers. Most assemblers do line number- 
ing automatically, but they still make you find out the number of a line 
you want to edit. ORCA's editor has full scrolling so you can move the 
cursor to a line and change it. If you want to insert lines, you move the 
cursor to where you want the new lines to go and insert them. Then you 
don't have to list the program again to see how they look in context be- 
cause the rest of the program is still there. 

The editing commands take some time to learn. Most of them are 
somewhat analogous to word processing commands. Unfortunately, 



they are arranged alphabetically on the reference card instead of by com- 
mand type. That's one minor flaw in the otherwise very useful and com- 
plete documentation. 

The assembler itself does its work in two major steps and a couple of 
minor passes. The first step creates what is called relocatable code. This 
code isn't yet ready to brun, but it's more compact than the source code 
and has all the command references resolved. The second step is per- 
formed by what is called the link editor, which has the job of putting all 
the relocatable subroutines together at a given location in memory and 
making the whole thing ready to run. The value of such a system is that 
ORCA can construct huge chunks of object code. The source code for 
really large programs would never fit in memory at one time, so ORCA 
has this provision to link many source files together during the assembly 
process. 

Another advantage of ORCA is the concept of local and global la- 
bels. If you're just writing small routines, that might seem unnecessary, 
but if you're doing anything large enough to have more than a few loops 
in it, you'll be glad that you can give them all the local name loop and not 
worry about the assembler getting confused. 

The source files for ORCA are included on the system source disk. If 
you want to set ORCA up for a particular system configuration, you 
use it to reassemble itself. The whole process has a sort of chicken-and- 
egg quality but serves as an example to the truly ambitious. What other 
assembler could put together an entire system Uke that in one large 
operation? DD

Microcomputer Circuit Analysis Program. By Andrew V. Thompson. 
Designing electronic circuits can be a lot of fun. With no more than a 
pad of paper, a pencil, and perhaps a pocket calculator, a creative engi- 
neer can amuse himself for hours on end trying to develop the optimum 
circuit to perform a particular task. Building and testing the design, how- 
ever, is much less entertaining, as anyone who does this for a living 
could tell you.

THE DEFENDANT IS GUILTY! 

... but can you prove it? 



A crime is committed! A suspect stands accused, and 
there are witnesses who must testify at his trial. YOU 
ARE THE PROSECUTOR. Your opponent is an 
unscrupulous defense attorney, and up to four other 
players can be witnesses, but — 

THE COMPUTER IS THE JUDGE! 

JURY TRIAL is high-tension courtroom drama that pits 
your skill against the tactics of your scheming opponent. 

Start by choosing a case from thousands of possible 
scenarios. Find the facts. Select a jury, and then try to 
prove your case in court. Everyone knows the defendant 
is guilty. It's your job to put him behind bars, but your 
opponent is devious. His witnesses will lie. He will try to 
thwart justice at every turn in order to save his client. 

By questioning the witnesses yourself (and objecting 
when your opponent tries to get favorable testimony), 



you build points with each of the 6 jurors. Some jurors 
are harder to convince than others. It all depends on how 
cleverly you present your evidence. 

• CAN YOU RECONSTRUCT THE CRIME SCENE? 

• CAN YOU PICK FAVORABLE JURORS? 

• CAN YOU TELL WHEN AN UNFRIENDLY WITNESS 
IS LYING? 

• CAN YOU AVOID YOUR OPPONENTS OBJECTIONS? 

• CAN YOU PERSUADE THE JURY TO CONVICT THE 
SUSPECT? 

Justice prevails when you outwit your opponent with 
devastating courtroom strategy, and see the defendant 
sentenced by the computer. If you fail to win your case 
however, you can appeal to a higher court and try again. 



Computer-assisted design programs have been with us for some 
time now. Unfortunately, they were available for use only on large and 
expensive computer systems. The Microcomputer Circuit Analysis Pro- 
gram is intended to bring this technology to Apple owners the world 
over. The package is comprised of several modules: a designer module, 
three analyzer modules, and, perhaps most important, a program that al- 
lows the user to establish parameters for the standard components that 
are used. All the important analog (as opposed to digital) components 
are represented here, such as op-amps, bipolar and MOS transistors, and 
transformers. Also, the waveforms to be applied to the imaginary cir- 
cuits created by the program may range from a simple sinusoid to a pro- 
grammable step input used for transient analysis. 

The circuit to be evaluated by the analysis program is first drawn on 
the screen using the keyboard. Standard components are retrieved from 
a library of shape tables, positioned up, down, or sideways, and then 
connected together in the correct arrangement. Resistor and capacitor 
values may be specified at this time, though much of the power of a cir- 
cuit simulator such as this is realized when component parameters are 
changed for each of several simulation tests. For each simulation, a 
graph of the response may be saved to disk, displayed on-screen, or sent 
to a Silentype printer. 

The program can support up to thirty different component intercon- 
nection points or nodes, though the actual number of components that 
may be used is much greater. In fact, one would be hard put to use up all 
fifteen op-amps allowed, plus fifty resistors and fifty capacitors. 

Circuits that have been entered into the program may be analyzed by 
three different methods: AC, DC, or transient. AC analysis is useful for 
determining the frequency or phase response of a circuit. A DC analysis 
will give the user an indication of steady state circuit conditions. Transi- 
ent tests are essential whenever designing things such as active filters, en- 
suring freedom from ringing or other signs of circuit instability. 

One of the most powerful features of the Microcomputer Circuit 
Analysis Program, an improvement over many of its predecessors, is its 
ability to recognize that a real diode has some amount of series resis- 



tance, that a real transistor always has at least some input capacitance, 
and that no op-amp can really have unlimited gain. A very wide range of 
independent parameters is assigned to all the components used by the 
program and may be changed at any time by the user. 

Despite all its features, the analysis program has several shortcom- 
ings. Drawing the components onto the screen is a fairly tedious proc- 
ess, and there are certain situations where connecting lines, once drawn, 
cannot be removed without starting over again. The circuit being devel- 
oped must be saved to disk constantly, as it is removed from memory 
every time a new option is selected. The program will run on an Apple II 
and lie — and on an Apple II Plus that has two drives as well as 64K 
memory. Instead of using normal copy-protection methods, this pro- 
gram uses a "key" that plugs into the game paddle socket, precluding its 
use with an Apple III in emulation mode. 

For many consuhants and small design groups, this extensive pro- 
gram will be a real godsend. Large amounts of trial and error hours will 
be eliminated and deadlines might even be met. EW

Hi-Res Architectural Design. By Don Fudge. Push a few buttons and 
watch a floor plan appear. Neat idea. Don Fudge apparently thought so 
and came up with a program for drawing fairly detailed architectural 
plans. The commands are simple and drawing a basic plan is relatively 
easy. These are choices of different width lines to indicate extoior and in- 
terior walls. There is also a menu of seventy-six different house plan 
shapes such as washbowls, toilets, doors, stairs, and circles. These are ac- 
cessible with the touch of a key and can be easUy rotated and moved 
around on the screen. 

The program allows you to design, store, and print floor plans. Side 
views of structural drawings or sketches can also be viewed. Printing, 
though, does require additional screen-dump software if more than con- 
trol character access is required on your printer for hi-res graphics. 

Hi-Res Architectural Design has some convenient features. It pro- 
vides on-the-move dimensional calculations, which appear at the bot-

drawn to wherever the cursor is currently positioned. A toggle converts 
this measurement to feet-inches format. The dimension calculator also 
figures the angle that would be created by a line drawn from the last 
point to the location at which the cursor is currently positioned. 

Other features include options to change the colors of lines drawn, to 
insert labels anywhere on the drawings, and to change the screen scale and 
the shapes scale independently. This makes it possible to create a wide 
range of drawings, from a whole floor plan to a detail of a room. 

The scale of all the shapes may be changed, but, because the two 
scales are not related to each other in any meaningful way, shapes used in 
a room may or may not be proportionally correct. Because of this limita- 
tion, the program can't be used for final building plans.

Alien. By Hans van Halteren and David Kuijt. Avalon Hill's Alien is 
chillingly faithful to its ancestry — the movie and book of the same name. 
An alien, captive aboard a starship of the future (a research vessel), es- 
capes its confines. The crew must recapture the alien, but time works 
against the hunters, for the creature is capable of metamorphoses into in- 
creasingly stronger and more deadly forms. Soon the hunters become the 
hunted. Adding to the problem are harmless lab animals released during 
the alien's escape; they're indistinguishable from the alien on the ship's 
sensors. The ship's orders are to bring alien life forms home for study; 
and around every corner may be a harmless creature or the stuff night- 
mares are made of 

Members of the crew have different capabilities and must be used 
skillfully to subdue the alien. Still, better a dead alien than a dead crew — 
but one of the crew is an android instructed to bring back the alien alive 
at all costs. He thwarts attempts to kill the alien. 

Should all else fail, the ship may be set on self-destruct. The crew 
must attempt to escape to the ship's shuttles before the reactors overload 
and explode. 

Detailed profiles of the crew, set forth in the manual, provide a rich 
backdrop for the imagination, as the game opens on a hi-res display of 
the starship and its thirty rooms and passageways. The graphic display of 
the starship is well done, but there are no close-ups of specific interior lo- 
cations. The general locations of humans, animals, and aliens are dis- 
played by the ship's sensors, along with a chart of specific crew locations 
and weapon status. 

You must deploy and use the crew strategically to overcome the 
evolving alien. Because the game is randomly drawn anew with each 
play, you never know exactly what capabilities the alien has each time or 
which member of the crew is the android. The best strategy is merely to 
be prepared for the unexpected and to act quickly. 

Game play is divided into movement and action phases for both crew 
and noncrew. Action points are expended for movement or activity such 
as weapon building or computer operation. Each member of the crew 
acts and moves separately. Using a game paddle to issue most com- 
mands brings freedom and convenience to the play of the game. No 
more mistyped keys and cryptic error messages. 

If you liked the movie, you'll love the game. Part horror story and 
part science fiction. Alien combines elements of fantasy role-playing with 
the challenge of strategy and comes out smelling like total 
enjoyment. WHH

The Einstein Compiler. By Dennis S. Goodrow and Shmuel Einstein. 
There are two major measures of a good Basic compiler. They are how 
much space the compiled code takes up in memory and on disk and how 
fast that code runs. Secondary considerations are ease of use, flexibility, 
documentation, and price. Einstein is a winner in all categories. 

Actually the speed difference between the various compilers avail- 
able isn't all that significant. We ran benchmark tests on four other com- 
pilers when they first came out. The object of one of the tests was to de- 
termine how fast Brian's Theme, a hi-res demo on the DOS System Mas- 
ter, could spin out thirty patterns. The Applesoft interpreter took ten

With the ECHO speech synthesizer from Street Electronics 
whatever you type on the keyboard, your computer can say. The 
echo's text-to-speech system gives your computer an 
unhmited vocabulary while using a minimum of memory. And 
now a diskette of fixed, natural sounding words is available 
to enhance the ECHO]['s voice output. 

Nearly 400 language rules are contained in the ECHO'S 
text-to-speech algorithm. These rules enable the computer to 
pronounce most correctly spelled words. When in the text-to- 
speech mode the user can select any of 63 different pitch 
levels, and have words spoken either monotonically or with 
intonation by using simple control character sequences. The 
rate of speech can be fast or slow; words can be spoken in 
their entirety or spelled letter by letter. The ECHOs also 
pronounce punctuation and numbers. Words can be encoded 
using phonemes and diphthongs when the text-to-speech or 
fixed vocabulary is not required. 

Applications are unlimited, ranging from phone answering, 
educational and training programs, to games and aiding the 
sight and speech impaired. The ECHO is a complete stand 
alone unit which is compatible with most any computer; it sells 
for $299.95. The ECHO][, which plugs into the Apple][, is 
priced at $149.95.

minutes and thirty-three seconds. The fastest and slowest compiled ver- 
sions took 5:34 and 6:00 respectively. A significant increase over Apple- 
soft, but not a big difference between the two. Einstein came in one sec- 
ond behind the faster time. 

Most compiler ads claim a speed increase from Applesoft to com- 
piled code of two to twenty times. That upper-end figure is usually exag- 
gerated. If you tried hard, you could probably create a program that was 
extremely inefficient in Applesoft, but wasn't nearly as inefficient in com- 
piled form. Such a program may run twenty times faster after compila- 
tion. But people don't write programs that way, or they shouldn't. A 
speed increase of two to five times is a reasonable expectation. 

It is in space considerations that Einstein shows a significant im- 
provement over the competition. All compilers generate code that is 
longer than the original Applesoft program. It's the price you pay. An- 
other of the programs we used to test those four compilers was Little 
Brick Out from the System Master. The most space-efficient of the com- 
pilers created a thirty-nine-sector compilation from the twenty-eight-sec- 
tor program, but to run the compilation you also needed to bload a 
seventeen-sector run-time library. Einstein compiled the same program 
into forty-eight sectors, including its run-time library. 

The space consideration may be the most important of all, because it 
may prevent a really large program from compiling at all. Einstein fairly 
consistently creates code that is less than twice the length of the original 
program, except where the original was very short. 

The Einstein Compiler is remarkably easy to use. If you're vrilling to 
accept the default parameters, you don't have to tell it anything. It even 
automatically recognizes the use of hgr or hgr2 commands and reserves 
the appropriate space in memory. If your program uses pokes to turn on 
hi-res screens, you have to tell it what memory to reserve, which entails 
answering a series of questions on parameters. 

With some compilers this is a traumatic experience. Einstein's superb 
manual, written by Michael G. Samet, has a section that systematically 
describes the meaning of each parameter, under what conditions you 
might want to change any parameter, and how to do it. The manual, Hke 
the program, is so well done that you can expect to compile most pro- 
grams successfully on the first attempt. 

Three of the available options are compressing the code, disabling 
line trace, and disallowing unstructured for-next loops. Each of these op- 
tions will make the final code faster and more compact. Nevertheless, 
there are good reasons for not using them all the time. The default con- 
figurations for the latter two favor the less efficient alternatives because 
programmers aren't perfect. Enabling line trace makes errors easier to 
find, and allowing unstructured loops makes the compiler more forgiv- 
ing of spaghetti logic. 

Because of the way Einstein works, it usually isn't necessary to add 
compiler directives in the form of rem statements to the source code. For 
more advanced applications, however, such directives are available. For 
instance, sometimes using a static storage area for string variables is pref- 
erable to allowing the program to store them dynamically and keep track 
of them with pointers the way Applesoft does. In this case a maximum 
length for strings must be set. If some strings should have a different 
maximum than others, they can be so designated in rem statements. By 
the same means, certain variables may be declared as global and passed 
on to other compiled programs that are either coresident or loaded and 
run by the first program. 

It's hard to find fault with The Einstein Compiler. Some of the other 
compilers available are good, and if you already have one you're happy 
with, you probably wouldn't want to replace it. Different needs will cer- 
tainly beget different choices of compilers, but if you're in the market for 
a compiler today, this newcomer deserves serious consideration. DD

Chargen VI. I is an updated, licensed version of Darrell and Ron 
Aldrich's classic Higher Text II. Chargen, which is short for character 
generator, is designed for the professional video producer. Working with 
this excellent font generator, Allen made major modifications. 

Terminology gets changed a bit. Higher Text's Large Font becomes 
Chargen's Little Print. Allen has devised a special way to expand that 
font four times. He calls this giant font Big Print. The program can also 
justify the fonts in a centered measure, something that has not been feas- 
ible before but is essential to video production work. 

A unique option is the TV Producers Display Program. This option 
is used in combination with any video genlock board for the Apple II 
Plus. Such add-on boards make the video signal output from the Apple 
II Plus conform to U.S. standards (NTSC). This optional program 
allows the video producer to mesh the title fonts into the large video edit- 
ing boards. This adds the titles in smoothly to live videotape. 

For the home hobbyist, college studio, and video artist, a scaled- 
down version of the Chargen Vl.l is available. The Tellitall also pro- 
duces Big Print fonts and can justify the fonts. The price for the Tellitall 
is one-third that of its big brother. 

Both programs come with ten fonts, and the company plans to re- 
lease separate font disks in the future. Would-be game designers, who 
have been experimenting with Arcade Machine or Pinball Construction 
Set, may delight in enhancing their games with these specialized 
fonts. RRA

The game's theme is an old, familiar one. Alien invaders swoop down 
from the top of the screen against one valiant defender. It seems that 
hordes of robot aliens have wiped out Earth's cities; now they're remov- 
ing the nitrogen from the atmosphere with devices called Twilight Mak- 
ers. Lucky for Earth, human scientists have constructed uninhabited de- 
coy cities that glow with an eerie green hue, attracting the aliens, then de- 
stroying them with weapons called gravity guns. 

When night falls, the only time they can attack, the aliens rain down 
X-bombs and death rays to destroy the city below. The city is randomly 
generated via a cosmic reactor core; should the aliens breach the reactor 
defenses, the emerald city explodes in colorful hi-res. 

The trusty gravity cannon may materialize anywhere in the emerald 
city. Besides destroying alien spaceships, the cannon can steal energy 
from the aliens to sustain the city. 

The alien mother ships are another matter. The mother ships drop 
multiple X-bombs and have to be shot on sight. And there's more. A sin- 
ister stellar vortex can utterly obliterate your city — and even the ordi- 
nary alien critters are sometimes invisible. 

During daylight, the energy from your reactor core rebuilds the city 
above. Then night returns, with twinkling stars and deadly aliens! 

Night Falls employs excellent hi-res graphics and imaginative sound 
effects. Attacking aliens come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. Compiled 
from Applesoft, the game is quick and challenging. On the higher of the 
nine skill levels, the invaders are aggressive and actively seek the reactor. 
And, as each day passes, the invaders grow smaller and harder to hit. 

To succeed at Night Falls, players must strategically circumvent the 
devilish design of the author. Constant choices and priorities decisions 
call for advance planning. 

In case some players become interested in modifying the game to suit 
their own needs — or to maintain their sanity — the original unprotected 
Applesoft version has been included on disk. The modified game can be 
compiled with any commercial compiler. 

Night Falls may be played by one or two players. High scores are 
saved with the player's initials. WHU

Get a Grip on 
Machine Language. 

Tiie Visible 
Computer: 6502 

The transition from Basic to machine language is a 
big step. Sometimes too big. 

Now there's a way to cut the problem down to size. 

The Visible Computer: 6502 is an integrated sys- 
tem for learning machine language programming. 
It features an animated simulation of the 6502 
microprocessor that lets you see with your own 
eyes what machine language is all about. You'll see 
how instructions are executed, not Just the result. 
There's a hand-holding mode that traps the kind of 
mistakes beginning machine language program- 
mers are apt to make. And an expert mode, with 
more than twenty commands and functions that 
make it a powerful debugger for your machine 
language programs. 

The 140 page manual is a hard-working tutorial 
on the fundamental concepts of machine language. 
You'll learn "hands-on-keyboard" as you work your 
way through thirty progressively more complex 
demonstration programs stored on disk. 

The Visible Computer: 6502 is available for the 
Apple II Plus (or He) for $49.95. If your dealer 
doesn't have it, you can order directly from Soft- 
ware Masters, 3330 Hillcroft #BB, Houston, Texas

out of periodicals. Since then, dozens of spjecialized database templates 
have been marketed. Each claims to have the easiest method of indexing 
printed material. The problem has always been that users have rarely 
found the time, or had the inclination, to enter the information piece by 
piece. LAMP comes to the rescue. 

LAMP stands for Literature Analysis of Microcomputer Publica- 
tions, representing the first library-quality index to microcomputer pub- 
lications; the large hard-copy compendium will be published bimonthly. 
Currently more than one hundred twenty publications are indexed, and 
more are constantly being added. Even foreign publications are included. 

The three major sections of LAMP are authors, subjects, and reviews. 
All technical articles, computer programs, monthly columns, reviews, 
and features are covered. Each section is completely cross-referenced 
with the other sections. The reviews include books and periodicals, edu- 
cational courseware, hardware, software, and computer games. 

The first volume, January -February 1983, contains more than three 
hundred pages of packed information. For December, a book, sum- 
marizing the whole year, is planned. Besides the regular publication. Soft 
Images is also making this index available on microfiche at a discounted 
rate. 

As more information is thrust into the marketplace every day, the 
task of organizing this data becomes more crucial. Every library, school, 
publisher, journalist, and public relations firm will find this publication 
an invaluable reference source. Unlike the usual high price for such de- 
tailed services, LAMP is priced for general use and should become a 
widely used reference source. RRA

Crime Stopper. By Daniel J. Kitchen and Barry Marx. In the beginning 
there was Sheriock Holmes, Nero Wolfe, the Thin Man, Charlie Chan, 
and Sam Spade. Now there's Al Clubs, super sleuth! The case: Rescue 
Cartier Blanche Sizemore from her kidnappers. Weaving through a web 



of clues, deceptions, and danger, you search for Cartier Blanche Size- 
more, hoping to find her before midnight, for that is when time runs out. 

Crime Stopper puts the player in the role of Al Clubs, private eye. 
This all-text adventure has a real flavor of the whodunit. The clues are 
many, often well disguised. The plot is well developed and the storyline is 
good. The technical quality of the game is a bit weak, and the vocabu- 
lary is skimpy but it serves the player well. There's no continuously dis- 
played status line, traditional in Scott Adams games; whether this is good 
or bad is a point of some disagreement among adventurers. 

A bug remains that makes a newspaper difficult to read: The first of a 
two-screen article scrolls by without stopping. You can get around it by 
saving just before you read the newspaper, then hitting reset as the text 
scrolls on. Restore to your save and go on. 

Crime Stopper has many enjoyable features, notable among them the 
system, complete with map. The main method of transportation in 
Crime Stopper is the subway system. Getting around is fairly straightfor- 
ward; the location descriptions are well done and colorful. Trying to find 
the clues is as much fun as solving the game itself. Crime Stopper is chal- 
lenging; solving it is no piece of cake and provides many hours of 
play time. 

The game includes some limited sound effects, a ringing phone and a 
gun firing, which help to enhance the mental picture. Al Clubs seems to 
bear a striking resemblance to the TV sleuth Colombo, right down to the 
rumpled raincoat. 

In comparison with the supersophisticated text adventures from In- 
focom, Crime Stopper is minor league; but compared with pregraphics 
Scott Adams adventures and their imitators, it's topnotch stuff. 

Certainly, starved mystery buffs will find it a good meal; although it 
isn't the equal of Deadline, it does capture the flavor of sleuthing. Inci- 
dentally, timing is all. TR

Assertiveness Training. By Patrick X. Nidorf. Ever stood in a long line 
at the bank — only to find that the teller refuses to cash your check be- 
cause the computer shows you don't have enough money in your ac- 
count... even though you made a sufficient deposit the day before? Ever 
feel like throwing that check in the teller's face? 

Or have you ever been driving home, after a hard day on the job, 
and felt the sudden urge to rear-end the guy that just cut in front of you, 
regardless of the damage to your car? (That'll show him!) 

You might expect a program called Assertiveness Training to teach 
you how to recognize responses such as these as unproductive aggressive- 
ness and avoid the unwanted consequences of acting on these impulses. 
The alternative: positive, self-assertive behavior. But the program's title 
is misleading. It will not really train you to be more assertive. It's really 
just a tool to help you be a bit more aware of yourself and think about 
how you might react when presented with different situations that could 
elicit aggressive behavior. 

Like other packages from Psychological Psoftware, this one contains 
a multiple-choice questionnaire, the results of which make the claim to 
tell you something about yourself that you don't already know. This is by 
no means a professional diagnostic tool. The only assurance of this 
questionnaire's credibility or value is the word of the program 
author, who is listed simply as Dr. Patrick X. Nidorf on the title 
page, with no further references given. (M.D., Ph.D., or D.V.M.?) 

The questions asked are all constructed along the same format, 
with the same four possible answers for each. The kind of re- 
sponses you are asked to make are pretty polarized, ranging from 
"always" to "never." Another alternative response you can make 
is "sometimes." Unless you're an extreme case, the latter will be 
the most common response to such questions as "Do you find it 
difficuh to make decisions?" The evaluation of your character, 
based on your answers to the questionnaire, remains very general, 
simplified and well within the bounds of commonsense advice. 
Other sections of the program give advice on how to act more 
assertively, both verbally and nonverbally. 

In a section headed "Special Problems," a very reasonable 
analysis is given on how best to cope with no-win situations. Ways 
to try to get in touch with the feelings you're having when this 
occurs, as well as to recognize the temptation to accept guilt 
wrongly placed upon you by another, are included in a valuable 
and thought-provoking discussion. A number of assertiveness tools 
are also pointed out, such as the use of role-playing techniques to 
practice being assertive. Giving positive reinforcement to yourself 
in an ongoing way is emphasized as an important aid in persevering 
in the development of assertiveness along the lines described. 

As a stimulus for starting to think about one's assertiveness, 
passivity, or aggressiveness, this program fills the bill. The first step 
in making any changes to oneself is awareness. Consider this pro- 
gram as the possible beginning of a longer journey. TC

Diversi-DOS. By Bill Basham. If you want to speed up your disk 
access, there are quite a few fast DOS packages. They're all pretty 
much the same speed: about two or three times as fast as Apple's 
DOS. If you want to know which one to buy, don't bother com- 
paring speeds. Ask instead, is it easy to use? Is it well documented? 
Is it protected? 

That last question is more crucial than you might think. DOS 
3.3 is the most copyable and copied program there is on the Apple, 
and Woz knew what he was doing when he made it that way. A 
DOS you can't copy easily is an impediment to the use of your 
computer. In the name of copy protection, some fast DOS pro- 
grams remove the init command, forcing you to use the master disk 
to format a new disk. 

Bill Basham was not so shortsighted. Not only did he leave the 
init command intact, he also provides a utility to copy Diversi-DOS 
onto a DOS 3.3 disk without erasing the programs on it. 

The instructions for Diversi-DOS are on the master disk instead 
of in a book. They can be printed out or read on the screen — 



remarkably complete for on-disk documentation, even includ- 
ing some well-written technical goodies about customizing Diversi- 
DOS for various uses. 

Diversi-DOS offers two useful side shows to go with the main 
attraction. The DOS mover allows you to put Diversi-DOS onto a 
RAM card. The other program sets up the RAM card as a print 
buffer and also allows the Apple to buffer keyboard input. 

Diversi-DOS's copyability is a major facet of DSR's distri- 
bution scheme. The company encourages you to copy the disk and 
give it to friends and requests that the recipients of the disk send 
DSR checks if they intend to keep them. Of course, Diversi-DOS 
is also available through normal channels. Low overhead for the 
company keeps the price down, which should keep people honest. 
It could be the best try-before-you-buy policy in the industry. DD

It's the Pits. By C. Anthony Ray. Pits are the problem, but they're 
not where this game is. 

An eat-'em-up with several fresh twists. It's the Pits is the first 
game from Sagebrush Software. Whatever else the game may have 
or lack, it has outstanding graphics and animation, especially for 
first-time authors and pubHshers. Critters pass over the background 
as well as in front of and behind each other with no color bleed- 
through. Everything's neat, clean, colorful, clever, and quick. 

Well, maybe not quite quick enough. Although the game would 
be near impossible to play at high speed, somehow the player still 
wishes it could go a little faster. A lot of the reasons for the min- 
imum speed are apparently deliberate. 

What strange sort of game would require all these paradoxical- 
sounding qualities? Consider this: As player, you control a grim- 
pet, a small, two-legged, big-eyed (and that's all) critter who 
absolutely loves to eai plums; and plums abound in this imaginary 
world. The grimpet has only to run between the maze walls pick- 
ing up plums. Only trouble is, there are no maze walls. In Grimpet- 
land, the walls must have been uprooted; in their place, and thus 
forming the maze, are deep fiery pits. Woe to the grimpet who falls 
in a pit. 

To wirlybats, grimpi are far more interesting than plums. Wirly- 
bats fly above the maze watching for grimpi to assume just the 
right position for the bats to sweep down and capture them by their 
little heads, carrying them off for heaven knows what mischief. 
The wirlybats follow distinct patterns, bouncing off walls like Pong 
balls; their main menace actually is one of distraction — and only 
the utmost concentration avoids the hellish pits. 

Grimpi have recourse against the wirlybats, anyway. If in suc- 
ceeding rounds a grimpet can collect a helmet and a candlestick, 
it becomes immune to the wirlybats' attacks. With burning candle 
settled upon the crown of the helmet, the grimpet can turn wirly- 
bats into mere puffs of smoke; then its only problem is staying out 
of the pits. 

At this point, it sounds like a cinch. Hang around as soon as 
you enter a level, do in the wirlybats (for good strong points), and 
you're home free; just wind through the maze and go on to the 
next. 

Ha. One misstep is all it takes. One corner anticipated an 
instant too soon, one misjudgment of the elasticized outside maze 
wall, one change of mind or pace and it's the pits. And, when a 
grimpet goes down, helmet and candle go with it; the next of your 
relay team of three can finish off the current maze in freedom, but 
it'H have to fend off the wirlybats without protection throughout 
the next maze and most of the one after that — regardless of how 
difficult — to regain helmet and candle. 

It's the Pits is a welcome harbinger of fine games to expect 
from a fresh new publisher. The graphics, the animation, the style, 
and the spirit are here; all that's to come is a tad more gaming 
value. Let's keep an eye on Sagebrush Software. f1(T

"Whatever did I put on this disk?" 

The catalog command, in Applesoft, is good enough when you're 
still working with a disk; but when all the programs run properly, and 
you're ready to put the disk in your utility file — or sell it— you may want 
something different. Something easier to use, and prettier, more user- 
friendly and professional-looking, as they say in the business. Or some- 
thing that will allow turnkey operation, so that the user need not know 
Applesoft to run the system. 

Here is a menu program that can be made part of the hello program 
(or called by it) and thus will come up whenever the disk is booted. It can 
list as many as nine programs, and you can select any one with a single 
keystroke. The menu program can handle Applesoft and machine lan- 
guage programs, randomly mixed. Also, the program name offered to 
the user can be different from the name the program is actually filed un- 



track of the values. 

Array variables tend to hang out with loops a lot. When you do some- 
thing in a repeating cycle, and each pass through the loop produces a 
value (or requires one), an array variable is a handy way to keep the vari- 
ous values in order. 

So far, we've been discussing one-dimensional array variables — the 
identifying tag has only one number on it. Sometimes more than one di- 
mension will be needed; for example, if you numbered the weeks of the 
year from 1 to 52, you could keep track of years of sunrises with the ar- 
ray Sunrise(year, week, day). 

Of course, you have to tell the computer what arrangement you're 
using, so it will know (for instance) whether a particular value belongs 
with the last day of this week or the first day of next. That's called di- 
mensioning the variable, and is done (surprise!) with a dimension state- 






A Custom Menu Generator 



JOCK ROOT 



der. This means the user can ask for Dice Game in order to get Dice Ma- 
trix 4.3, or some such. 

All of this is accomplished by means of a two-dimensional string ar- 
ray, which is loaded with paired data statements. If that sounds compli- 
cated, don't worry; it's simply a way of keeping two lists side by side. 
When the user asks for an item from one list, the program sends out a 
call to DOS for the matching item, and it is loaded and run (or brun, 
whichever is appropriate). 

The nice thing about keeping the lists of names this way is that it's 
easy to make changes. You simply add, or remove, one line of the pro- 
gram. Each data line is of the form 

2000 DATA "USER NAME","DISK FILE NAME" 

in which the user name is that which the person using your program asks 
for, and the disk file name is what's on the disk. Thus, if you want to add 
another program to the disk, you can include it in the table of contents 
simply by adding a data line to the menu program. The program auto- 
matically adjusts the display format to compensate for the number of da- 
ta lines included, so you don't have to worry about that when you add or 
remove a program. 

Arrays and Indexes. Before we plunge into the program itself, let's do 
a quick review of array logic (if you know about this already, skip 
ahead). 

An array variable is not actually one variable; rather, it's a set of sev- 
eral related variables that have numbered tags so you (and the com- 
puter) can tell them apart. Arrays are useful when you want to do some- 
thing several times and keep track of the several different results. For 
example, if you wanted to record the hour of sunrise for every day of the 
week, you could use an array variable like Sunrise(day), which is actual- 
ly the set of variables Sunrise(Monday), Sunrise(Tuesday), and so on. Of 
course, the computer will store the variables as SU(1), SU(2), and so on 
to save space, but we can go along with that as long as it keeps 



ment, dim for short. For ten years of sunrises, you could use dim 
Smrise( 1 0,52,7). Or, if you wanted an arrangement by months instead of 
weeks, four weeks to the month, you could use dim Sunrise(10, 12,4,7). 

Oops! That wouldn't work. Can you see why? It has to do with that 
four-weeks-to-the-month assumption. In fact, even Sunrise (year, week, 
day) would need an adjustment every year, since there are not exactly 
fifty-two weeks in a year. You have to watch out for that sort of thing 
with arrays. 

To summarize, an array variable represents a set of values, distin- 
guished by numbered tags of the form (x), where xis a number. This 
number is usually called the index of the variable. A one-dimensional 
variable will have one index, a two-dimensional one will have two in- 
dexes, a three-dimensional one will have three, and so on. 

It's very important, if you have a several-dimensional variable, to 
keep the dimensions (the indexes) in the right order. You can imagine 
some of the problems that might result from getting them mixed up. 
We'll have more to say about this later, when we talk about nested loops. 

But that's enough about array variables for the moment. We're now 
ready to start taking the menu program apart. 

The Program Begins. The purpose of the disk data section, beginning 
at line 10, is to identify the particular disk in use. This information will 
appear as a header line over the choices shown on the menu. These items 
are right at the front of the program, so they'll be easy to find when you 
want to change them for a different disk. 

The items in the disk data section are self-explanatory, except for the 
strange spelling of DAETS; that's necessary because, if you spell it 
DATES, the Apple will boggle at the reserved word, at, and translate 
the names as D AT E$. 

In line 70, we skip to the other end of the program to pick up some 
more values. Why are they out there at the end? Several reasons, but one 
stands out 

Every time Applesoft does a gosub or a goto, it has to check each 
program line in order, starting with line 1, to find a match for the line

number it's looking for. This takes time — the more lines Applesoft has to 
check, the more time it takes. Thus it makes sense to write your program 
with as few lines as possible between the front end and the busy parts. 

The job we're doing now, loading variables — often called initializing 
the system — only has to be done once, at the beginning of the run; so it 
isn't a very busy part of the program. Therefore we put it at the end, 
where it won't slow the program down, and we get to it with a subrou- 
tine call. 

In this case, it doesn't really matter — our program is so short that 
any slowing effect would be unnoticeable. But we have to do the initial- 
izing somewhere, so why not do it the "professional" way? 

After initializing, we print the header. This is where all that disk data 
gets used. 

Next we have to read in the choices from those paired data state- 
ments. It's loop and array time. 

Filling the Array. What's the first thing you do in dealing with an ar- 
ray? Right, you dimension it — line 210. This is a string array, because we 
want to fill it with words rather than numbers; otherwise it behaves just 
like the sunrise array described earlier. 

In case you're wondering what the use is of a dimension of 1 , as we 
have here (how can it be an array, if there's only one value in it?), you 
should note a peculiarity of dimension numbering it always starts at 
0. Thus if you dimension a variable as V(l), it has room for two val- 
ues, V(0) and V(l). We usually ignore this, using the values from 1 up 
and wasting the V(0) space; but, when you only need to store two values, 
you can save a third of the memory space you'd otherwise need by using 
that value. 

So now we have a string variable, N$(9,l), which can hold nine pairs 
of strings (well, ten really), with each pair consisting of a 0 string and a 1 
string. The 0 string is going to be the user name for the program, the 
name that is offered in the menu display; the 1 string of each pair will be 
the disk file name of the same program. 

Now (in line 220) we have to deal with a side issue: what's this onerr 
goto about? 

One of the classic problems with loops is how to get out of them. The 
familiar for-next loop has a built-in counter, and when the counter 
reaches a certain value, you exit. But suppose for some reason you have 
to exit in the middle? Suppose, for example, you run out of data before 
the counter is finished? 

Normally, that counts as an error, and Applesoft provides an error 
message to tell you so. But suppose you meant for your program to run 
out of data? Suppose you wanted to use that data runout as a signal — 
not of an error condition but merely to tell the computer, "You've got all 
there is — now do something with it!" 

That's one of the clever uses of the onerr goto statement: it does 
exactly that. It tells the computer, "This isn't really an error— just a sig- 
nal that this process is finished, and you should start something else." 

In this case, it means, "that's all the data you're gonna get; now do 
line 270." 

That's how the program is able to adjust itself to any number of data 
statements (up to nine pairs) without being told. 

We'll deal with what happens at line 270 in a little while, but there's 
something interesting happening right in front of us. Speak softly, 
friends, and watch your step: we are approaching a pair of nested loops! 

I and J are the indexes (they're a couple of old favorites, among loop 
fans). Note that J does indeed start with zero, although wasteful I doesn't 
bother to. 

Now the thing to watch out for with nested loops is this: you must 
never get the inside one mixed up with the outside one. The outside one 
starts first; then the inside one starts, and ends; finally, the outside one 
ends. 

A for-next loop, of course, begins with the for and ends with the next. 
In our case, the outside loop is the one with the I index, since it begins 
first (line 230). That makes the J loop the inside one (beginning at line 
240), which means it has to end first. 

In other words, the good old Apple has to take the next J (if any are 
left) before it takes another I; the J loop has to end before the I loop can 
continue. 

All of which explains why line 260 is next J,I instead of the more 
natural next I, J. And don't you forget it! 



Now that we've got our housekeeping squared away, let's take a look 
at the purpose behind it all — the line that's inside of both loops, read 
N$(I,J). This line reads the next available data statement into one of the 
eighteen spaces (that's nine pairs, or I times J) of our array. Each time 
around, one (or both) of the indexes will be different, so we'll eventually 
fill all eighteen spaces. 

Unless, of course, we run out of data. That will generate an error sig- 
nal, and . . . well, here we are at line 270! 

NC is the number of choices offered — the number of pairs of data 
statements we read before we ran out of data. The reason it's one less 
than the I index, instead of equal to it, is that whatever forced the error 
break would have happened after the I counter was incremented for that 
cycle, so the counter would read one too many. Even a normal exit from 
the for-next loop leaves the index reading one high, because of the count- 
er logic, "increment the counter and compare to the preset limit; if too 
high, exit." 

And now the program knows how many choices there are. 

Displaying the Choices. The next step (line 300) is for the program to 
offer those choices to you, the user. That's done with another for-next 
loop, but this one is simpler: we're displaying only one-half of the pair, so 
we need only one index this time. We'll use good old X. 

Note that good old X appears in two places inside the loop. In line 
330 it provides a line number for the display, and in 340 it selects the Xth 
pair of strings. The other dimension of N$(X,0) being zero, line 340 al- 
ways prints the user name of the program. 

Before we actually get into that loop, there's a sidestep (line 310) to 
adjust spacing. This subroutine is out toward the end, like the initialize 
routine, because it only needs to be called a few times during the run — 
twice, in fact, as we will see in a moment. 

What it does is add one or more blank lines, depending on how many 
choices are to be offered: this will make the display better looking, which 
is nice, and easier to read, which is essential. Note that this subroutine 
(line 1200) uses the NC value we just determined. 

So now we have a header line at the top of the screen, with an appro- 
priate amount of blank space under it. Now we need to print the choices

themselves, so roll the loop! And here again we use NC, this time for the 
upper limit (line 320). This will give us one display line (one pass through 
the "print a line" loop) for each choice. 

Next (line 380) we call the spacing routine again, this time to get an 
even space between the choices. 

Where the User Comes In. Finally, line 410 prints the prompt line — 
the line that tells you what to do next — and waits for a response (line 
420). 

Note the use of get rather than input. Input is fine when you want the 
Apple to expect an input of unknown length (for example, in entering a 
name), but when you know that only one character is coming, why make 
the user press return after it? Whenever you can be sure how many char- 
acters are coming in, the get command is much easier for the user to deal 
with. 

When a response comes in from the keyboard, the program has to 
evaluate it: there are three possibilities. 

The first is an escape loophole, useful mainly for testing the pro- 
gram. If the received character is a space, line 510 does a poke to cancel 
the onerr goto condition and restore normal error handling and then 
ends the run. 

You should probably change this before turning the program over to 
a naive user it's easy to hit the space bar by accident. To change it, type 
in some other character between the quotes, instead of a space. The as- 
terisk (*) might be a good choice, since it couldn't input by accident (you 
need to press two keys, neither of them a number). Or you could use // 
QS = CHR$(27} then. . . in line 510 to have it respond to the escape key. 
Once you've got the program thoroughly debugged, if you'll want a se- 
cure turnkey menu so that the user can break out of the program (that is, 
escape into Applesoft) even by accident, then simply omit line 510 and 
remove the poke 216,0 from line 270. Then, anything users do will result 
in one of two things — running a stored program or getting another 
prompt. 

Line 520 would take the input and return a number, if the user typed 
a number; if anything else was typed, it would return zero. Then line 530 
would go to an error routine (we'll get to that later), which eventually 



would return to the prompt. 

Line 540 does the same for an illegal number — one larger than the 
number of choices offered. 

If it's a number, nonzero and not too big, then it's legal input — we 
will respond politely. Line 550 acknowledges the request by repeating it 
back to the screen. 

Then there's a little housekeeping to be done. We're about to send 
out a call to DOS, asking for the program the user wants; and every call 
to DOS using control-D — known to its friends as D$ — must be pre- 
ceded by a return. 

That's what the print in line 580 is for, but there's a snag here. If we 
happened to be on the bottom line of the display at the time — and we 
would be, with eight or nine choices — a print command would scroll the 
whole display, eating the header line and generally messing things up. 

So line 560 calls —998, the address of an Applesoft routine that 
moves the cursor up one line. That gives us the space to print without 
scrolling. 

And in the meantime, we begin to format the command to run the re- 
quested program. 

Getting What You Want. The number you ask for when you request 
a program is known to the Apple as Q (determined in lines 420 and 520), 
so the disk file name we want is in N$(Q,1). Line 570 gets it and renames 
it N$ to simplify matters later. 

And now we're almost home, unless something goes wrong. 

Line 610 sets up an "errorless" jump in case DOS sends back a "file 
not found" message. It doesn't indicate a problem yet — we're asking for 
an Applesoft file the first time, and our target might be a binary file. 

Line 620 is the DOS command itself. The purpose of the whole pro- 
gram is to generate this one line! 

If we don't score with that one, we'll fall through to line 660, another 
onerr goto. If the program finds an error here, we'll be in trouble — it 
means that there was neither a binary nor an Applesoft program under 
the requested name; but we do not want to fall into Applesoft as a result, 
which is what a normal error break would cause. 

What we want, instead, is to go back to the main prompt. We erase

the message from line 550 by sending the cursor to the left margin and 
calling CLREOL (clear to end of line) at -868. A print command 
would do the same as the call, but since it also might scroll the display, 
we'd do it this way. 

Then we print an explanation and go to the main error routine. 

Mistaaak! The program uses a two-part error routine, with a cus- 
tomized "head" and a common "body"; that is, there are two different 
versions of the first part of the routine, one for each of the possible error 
conditions (illegal input or file not found). The second part is the same 
for both situations. 

The head section of the routine prints a message to tell you what 
went wrong. Then the body section beeps to get your attention, waits for 
you to read the message, and sends you back to the prompt. 

The ill^al input head (line 800) is a little more complicated than the 
file not found head (line 700). We want to erase the prompt line but leave 
the input on the screen so you can see what was wrong with it. This is 
done with B$, a string of blanks (spaces) just long enough to wijje out the 
prompt string. 

Then we move forward — from the line 700 head by means of a goto, 
from line 8(K) by simply continuing — to the body at line 900. 

Here you see the advantage of subroutines. Most of the work of this 
program section is farmed out via subroutine calls. The only thing that's 
actually done here is to erase the prompt line again, this time with 
CLREOP (clear to end of page) at —958. This will erase the entire 
prompt area so we can start over. 

And finally, at line 960, we send the program back to give another 
prompt. 

Notice that this, too, is a kind of loop. It doesn't have a counter, like 
a for-next loop, but every time something goes wrong (bad input or a 
missing file), you'll get the beep and the wait subroutines and then go 
back to the prompt again. 

That's why line 510, the escape loophole, is in the program. It pro- 
vides a way out of that endless cycle, which can be very useful if you 
make any modifications to the program. 

We have now finished the main sequence of the program. All that is 
left is a handful of subroutines, and the data statements themselves 
(they're out at the very end). 

The subroutines begin at line 10(X). In a very large program, the rou- 
tines that are called most often should come first — it shortens the proc- 
ess of counting through the line numbers to find a match — but this pro- 
gram isn't big enough for it to matter. 

The Delay Timer. Take a close look at the timer in line 1000. The 
logic of the timer is sort of folded in on itself, which makes it tricky to fol- 
low, but it also provides a lot of power in a small space. If you need a de- 
lay timer with a wide range of settings, you might want to use this pat- 
tern in your own programs. 

Like many programming tricks, the delay timer is easiest to under- 
stand if you look at it backward. We'll start with lines 1060 and 1070, 
the main loop of the routine. 

This is your basic for-next loop. Most timer routines have one of 
these in them, in some form. This one counts up to Time, which is a var- 
iable defined in the initialize routine. 

Even at microelectronic speeds, counting takes time; the length of 
time is proportional to the number you count up to. Thus, changing the 
value of the Time variable is one way you have of controlling the length 
of the delay. 

Now we'll go forward by backing up one step: consider line 1050, 
gosub 1060. 

Huh? Whassat? We're at 1050, and we want to gosub 1060? 
!##*!????!! 

Easy, easy, be cool — it's another programming trick. What's impor- 
tant about this trip is not where we're going to, but where we're coming 
back to. Got that? Good. 

Line 1060 is the timer itself: every time you get sent there, you count 
through one cycle and return. That's clear enough. 

Ah, but watch out for that innocent-looking return. It jumps all over 
the place! That's why the important thing about this pattern is where you 
go back to — we're going to get a lot of mileage out of that return 
statement! 

Let's get back to line 1050: fi-om here you go to 1060, count one 



cycle, and come back. Then you advance to the next line, as usual. Now 
you're at line 1060, the timer, so you count one cycle — that's two, now — 
and return; and this time, you return to the line that sent you to line 1050 
in the first place. 

Let's repeat that: when you're sent to line 1050 on a subroutine call, 
you go through the timer once on a subsubroutine, and then once more 
on a fall-through; then you go back to whatever line sent you. Thus, get- 
ting sent to line 1050 means doing two cycles and returning. 

Suppose — we now advance another step backward — you get sent 
from line 1040? Why, you do two cycles and return to line 1040, of 
course. 

Yes. And then you fall through into line 1050, and do two more 
cycles; and after that, you go back to the line that sent you to line 1040. 
Four cycles this time. 

See the pattern? Sure you've got it, now? Okay, then you can ad- 
vance back to line 1000 by yourself. Take it slow and you won't get dizzy. 

The purpose of this arrangement is to give you another way of con- 
trolling the time delay. Depending on where you enter the routine (which 
line you gosub to, from 1010 to 1060), you can get from one to thirty-two 
cycles. Thus if you pick a large number for Time, so that one cycle takes 
one second, you can select a delay between one second and half a 
minute. 

You can even fine-tune the routine to get the effect of an entry point 
between the entry points. For example, this one offers you a choice of 
sixteen or thirty -two cycles. Suppose you need twenty? Easy; you just call 
the routine twice, once with the sixteen-cycle entry (line 1020) and once 
with the four-cycle entry (line 1040). The times will add, and there you 
have your twenty cycles. In fact, that's how the delay is done here— lines 
920 and 930. 

By the way, despite the round-and-roundness of it, this multiple-en- 
try pattern of alternating gosub and fall-through is not a loop. Remem- 
ber, the whole purpose of this pattern is to be slightly different at each en- 
try point; and the defining characteristic of a loop is that it's always the 
same, cycle after cycle. 

If you plan to use this timer for several different delays in one pro-

gram, note that the two control adjustments for the timer (selecting the 
entry point, and setting the value of Time) have different effects. Picking 
the entry point will get the delay for that particular call, but changing 
Time will affect every timer call in the program. 

And now, having spent enough time on that, we'll return to the main 
program. 

Last Bits and Pieces. Actually, there isn't much left of it that we 
haven't covered — only a couple of simple subroutines, and the data state- 
ments themselves. The Beep-Beep routine (line 1 100) makes a double 
beep (CHR$(7) twice), then a pause (with the timer), then the double 
beep again. 

Line 1910, in the initialize routine, deserves a mention. The reason B$ 
is split like that is to make it easy to copy with the cursor, in case you 
want to change the length. If it were in one piece, Applesoft would break 
it in two when listing it, without marking the break. 

And finally we have the data statements themselves — the program's 
own reference file. The main thing to remember about these is the for- 
mat quotes around each name, and a comma between them. If you leave 
out any of that stuff, the program is likely to run two of the statements 
into one and mix up the data from that point on. 

However, because of the quotes, you can use almost any characters 
you like in the name, except another quotation mark or a carriage re- 
turn (and, of course, the disk file name has to follow DOS rules). 

You may have noticed that all the user names in this program call the 
same disk file name, the program called Sorry. That was done for devel- 
opmental purposes; the Sorry program gives you a blank screen with the 
message, "That program is temporarily out of service." Then it returns 
you to the Disk Menu program. 

Hooking It Up. And that brings up the last question we have to deal 
with. How do you get the menu program in the first place? 

There are two ways. The simplest is to store the Disk Menu program 
as the hello program. To do this, set it up before you initialize the disk, 
edit the disk data section appropriately, put in a blank disk, and type init 
hello. 

A better way to make a classy turnkey system is to have a separate 
hello program, perhaps a fancy graphics display featuring the name of 
the disk (and, of course, your name); something like the title page of a 
book. Then that program calls the Disk Menu, just as the title page in a 
book is followed by a table of contents. 

To do that, make the last line of your title page/hello program read 
as follows: 

PRINT CHR$(4)"RUN DISK MENU" 

assuming you call your version of this Disk Menu. (CHR$(4) is the DOS 
call, control-D.) This line can also be used in other programs whenever 
you want to get back to the main menu; that's how the Sorry program 
does it. 

And that's all there is to it! Enjoy.

Remember back in March when we discussed the sins and virtues of 
options trading? Well, in this issue, we'll examine a program intended to 
help options traders to value options and make investment decisions. 
OptionX, Crawford Data Systems (350 North Lantana Avenue, Suite 
561, Camarillo, CA 93011; 805-4844159). $145. 

Backup policy. Copyable. 

System requirements: Apple II with 16K card or Applesoft firm- 
ware; Apple II Plus, Apple He; one disk drive. 

OptionX is designed to help the investor calculate the "correct" value 
of a stock option, the theoretical value the option should be trading at, 
based on the strengths, weaknesses, and potential of the underlying 
security. 

Tracking Options. The number of disk drives you have determines 
the number of options that OptionX can track and analyze. With one 
drive, the program can follow eighty options; with two, the program can 
follow four hundred options. The more options the program is follow- 
ing, however, the slower it runs, so you won't want to use the two-disk 
capability unless you need it. 

Options are time-sensitive instruments. Their values change daily, for 
two reasons: Price changes occur in the underlying security and options 
have a limited life. If an option you own is one day away from expira- 
tion and the underlying security would have to move up fifty points in 
order for you to realize a profit on it, and it's already 3:45 p.m. in New 
York, you can bet your bottom dollar that the option (if it's a call) is 
worth virtually nothing. 

One of the parameters we need to supply to an option valuation 
model is today's date, which allows the program to compute the number 
of days until expiration. OptionX does these calculations automatically, 
allowing the investor to enter the date in any of a variety of formats. 
When you select the expiration command, OptionX displays the expira- 
tion dates of the next twelve options you're holding in your portfolio. 

Options Analysis. Other options packages we've examined required 
the investor to enter the options data through an input module and then 
the analysis was activated. OptionX differs fi^om these other options pro- 
grams in that its analysis process is interactive. The program prompts the 
investor for information throughout the analysis process and generates 
an analysis report whenever it has sufficient data to do so. 

The investor must inform the program whether it will be evaluating 
puts or calls. Why? Because calls make money when the price of under- 
lying stock rises, whereas puts make money when the underlying stock 
falls in price. If OptionX doesn't know what to look for, then it can't 
show the investor what it has found. 

Once the investor has supplied the necessary information, the pro- 
gram asks for the symbol of the stock to be analyzed. As mentioned ear- 
lier, time is an important parameter in evaluating any option. OptionX 
requests the expiration date of the options under consideration and then 
asks for the striking price. The striking price of an option is the price at 
which you may purchase the underlying stock on a call or sell it on a put. 

To ensure the accuracy of the program, it's important to make cer- 



tain that these and all of the other parameters input are correct. One mis- 
take in a crucial variable and the whole study will be wrong, and this 
could cost the investor a bundle. 

Tlie Difference. How else is OptionX different from the other op- 
tions programs on the market? According to the author, "OptionX is 
oriented toward the rapid comparison of either call or put options on the 
same stock but with different expiration dates and different strikes." 

The options programs we've looked at in the past are designed to 
evaluate a single option or various options strategies. OptionX compares 
and analyzes the time-differentiated options on a single security, so that 
the investor can choose the best option investment opportunities on that 
particular security. To facilitate OptionX's analysis, the investor can 
rapidly enter the required data on as many as nine more options on the 
same security without having to repeat the stock's symbol each time. 

The first report generated by OptionX shows the option model being 
used, the stock being analyzed, the current price of the stock (which was 
entered by the investor earlier), the stock's volatility (which reflects its 
past susceptibility to price fluctuations), the current dividend, the mar- 
ket interest rate (which is entered by the investor), the theoretical value of 
the option, the hedge ratio, and the option's leverage. 

What does this report tell us? It shows us if an option is either under- 
valued or overvalued. Under and overvalued options can present profit- 
able investment opportunities. If we buy something that is undervalued 
and then resell it at its "true" value, we profit. If we contract to sell some- 
thing at an overvalued price, and then buy it when the price more closely 
reflects its actual value and deliver it, we also profit. The theoretical value 
of an option is the price the option should sell for according to the valua- 
tion model being used. This computation helps us identify over or under- 
valuation. 

The hedge ratio illustrates the increase in the price of a call option 
that results from a one-point increase in the price of the underlying stock. 
Leverage is the percent increase in the value of the underlying stock. The 
hedge and leverage calculations, which the program performs for us, tell 
us what percentage an undervalued or overvalued option would have to 
move in order for us to make a profit. 

This report relies exclusively on the theoretical, or fair, price 
predicted by the model. The next step in the analysis is to input the actual 
closing prices for the options being studied. These prices are available in 
print from many local newspapers or from Barron's. They can also be re- 
trieved from a remote database (such as Dow Jones or CompuServe) 
using a terminal software package. OptionX has no data retrieval ca- 
pabilities, so any information retrieved electronically must be entered 
manually, negating any time savings and accuracy associated with elec- 
tronic updates. 

Net Premiums. After the prices for each option in the study have 
been entered, the computer displays the net premium in points, the net 
premium in percent, and the implied volatility for each option. 

The net premium is the price change in the underlying security that 
would have to happen in order to profit by exercising (or selling) the op-

tion. The net premium calculation reflects the commission costs the user 
would incur in executing the transaction (thus, net versus gross). OptionX 
allows investors to input the commission schedules of their own brokers 
so that the costs used in the calculations reflect those that the investors 
actually face. 

The next report the program generates is a return (or profit) report, 
which deducts broker commissions from the gross return. The report 
shows the immediate return to the investor, the maximum return pos- 
sible, and the maximum return possible as a percent per year. 
Pressing any of the Apple's keys displays the commissions used in the 
calculations. 

Dividends paid per share and the put conversion value are also 
included in the profit report. The put conversion value indicates the the- 
oretically "correct" price of a put, based on the price of a call that has the 
same striking price and expiration date. 

At this point, OptionX has finished its calculations and has dis- 
played all the information in its reports. The investor may review the re- 
sults again on the display or send them to a printer. 

The volatility calculations performed by OptionX, which are used 
during the analysis, are accessed via the main menu. The volatility up- 
date menus are clear and easy to use. The volatility calculations can be 
done before or after an OptionX analysis session. Volatility updates are 
normally done before the analysis, but if you want to see if there's any 
significant difference in the valuation you can wait until after the analy- 
sis session. 

Optional Models. OptionX allows the investor to choose either the 
Black-Scholes model or the Cleeton model to value options. The major 
difference between the two models is that the Black-Scholes model is 
based on the mathematical theory of what options "should" sell for, 
while the Cleeton model is based on what options have actually sold for. 
Black-Scholes is steeped in theory; the Cleeton model is based on past 
market experience. Although the two formulas are very different, the re- 
sults obtained by using them are remarkably similar. Of course, it's up to 
the individual investor to select the method he feels most comfortable 
with. 

According to James C. Moule, the author of the program, OptionX is 
no substitute for "experience, judgment, and hard work. The program 
makes no attempt to predict the future. I have never discovered a mathe- 
matical formula for predicting future prices," says Moule, "and I doubt 
that one exists." 

Moule is right. Any computerized stock market tool is only as good 
as the skills of the investor who interprets its output. Computers act as an 
adjunct to the investor, not as an advisor. And as far as predicting the fu- 
ture goes, you can be sure that Moule knows what he's talking about. 
Accurate soothsayers, whether in the stock market or in a tea parlor, are 
few and far between. 

The program documentation provides a step-by-step walk-through 
of a typical OptionX session. This section is very well written and helps 
users learn not only the system's operation but some of the theory used 
in valuing options. The OptionX documentation also explains the theory 
behind the program and its internal workings. A glossary aids the in- 
vestor in understanding the terms used, and a reference section lists major 
publications and papers about options. For the serious options trader, 
this reading is a must. 

Conclusions. Moule's program is sound. OptionX is very well error- 
trapped and easy to use, and the program documentation is excellent — 
and, in one section, "final comments," rather humorous as well. 

It would seem that the only weak spots in OptionX are its inability to 
use directly captured information from a remote database and its lack of 
graphic representations. Many investors find it much easier to absorb 
information from a graph than from a column of numbers. But this is 
not to say that the report formats of OptionX did not present their infor- 
mation clearly. They did. 

The outputs of this program can be used by both casual and serious 
students of options. The theories underlying the analytical models are 
generally accepted both by academicians and professional traders. Of)- 
tions investors would do well to consider and evaluate OptionX's poten- 
tial as an analytical adjunct.

SOFICARD 
Symposioin 

by Greg Tibbetts 



Welcome to the May installment of SoftCard Symposium. This time 
we'll deal with the last two character I/O routines, LIST and LISTST, 
and cover any remaining material related to the handling of character da- 
ta by the BIOS. 

The LIST and LISTST routines control the CP/M logical LST: de- 
vice category. This category was designed because of the need to pro- 
duce character output of a printed nature, such as program listings, for- 
matted documents, and even copies of the console I/O data. In speaking 
of LST:, Digital Research identifies it as "the principal listing device, if it 
exists on your system, which is usually a hard-copy device, such as a 
printer or Teletype." 

Two things about that statement are worth noting: first, the fact that the 
LST: device need not be implemented in your system at all; and second, 
that a physical device in that category need not be a hard-copy device. 
It's perfectly acceptable to implement LST: as any output-only device (or 
as the output side of any bidirectional device), though it would take some 
special circumstances for such a system to be really useful. Normally, 
then, physical devices that fit into the LST: device category are printers. 

Printers are a very diverse class of equipment. They run the range of 
sophistication, complexity, and cost, from very low to very high. Some, 
such as the laser printers, even require powerful internal processors dedi- 
cated to the task of translating the ordinary ASCII values input to them 
into the values their hardware must have in order to produce their par- 
ticular forms of "marks on paper." In all cases, though, the printer as a 
unit (the word unit is sometimes meant to include both the printer and its 
interface) is designed to accept simple ASCII code values and to create 
their human-understood symbolic equivalents on paper. 

In addition to creating hard-copy images of the printable ASCII 
character values, all but the very simplest of printers are set up to accept 
certain control codes (as we saw when we discussed terminals). These 
codes, which are either part of the ASCII nonprintable subset or combi- 
nations of a lead-in character and one or more printable characters, 
cause the printer to perform certain operations rather than to print any 
of the code values themselves. 

Printers have in the past, however, been inherently "streaming-type" 
devices. This concept is best explained by contrasting a printer with a 
terminal (which is a random access device rather than a streaming or se- 
rial device). Terminals deal at all times with presenting a screen of infor- 
mation. At times the difference between one screen of information and 
the next is only a single character. Terminal displays are extremely alter- 
able (they're completely redrawn sixty times each second), so it became 
important to increase their efficiency by simply altering only the charac- 
ter or characters that had actually changed, rather than by reprinting the 
entire screen. 

In response to this need, terminal manufacturers provided methods 
by which the cursor (in this case, the cursor is simply a pointer to the 
place where the next character will be displayed) could be moved in- 
stantly to a given screen location and a character of data altered. This is 
why we classify terminals as random access; any bit of information on 
the entire screen can be ahered in a random, rather than a serial, fashion. 
Because of this nature of the screen, manufacturers of system software 
adapted; and while the addressing codes themselves, for example, may 



mil iiii 

differ from terminal to terminal, the use of cursor addressing is nearly 
universal. 

Printers, on the other hand, have little random access capability. 
Having produced a character on paper, a printer is generally powerless to 
change that character completely. Once a character exists in printed form 
on paper, a simple overstrike is the only thing that can be done to alter it. 
Printer manufacturers, therefore, were under no compulsion to provide a 
means to back up the paper-feed mechanism, a way to address the print head 
within an entire sheet of paper, or othw random access features. 

Though a few printers today have such features (or limited features 
of this type), they are still not truly random access in nature because the 
printed image they produce is still permanent. Consequently, system soft- 
ware has continued to treat the printer as a stream (or serial) device, with 
the result that only the very standard control codes — such as carriage re- 
turn, linefeed, tab, and so on — are the least bit universal. As such, no 
print function tables or other more sophisticated systems exist for the 
LST: device category, and the system software simply sends characters 
one at a time, one after the other, to the requested interface in a stream, 
or serial, manner. It is left to the applications software producers to im- 
plement any special codes that may be required, putting them in their 
business or utility software and outputting them serially when they are to 
be used. A software producer must, therefore, also know what printer 
a package is deahng with and must structure codes accordingly. 

It's because of all this that the BIOS LIST and LISTST routines are 
much simpler than their console counterparts. 

Essentially, LIST is the routine that takes the ASCII value con- 
tained in register [C] (parity bit reset) and sends it to the printer, while 
LISTST is the routine that tells the program calling it whether or not the 
printer is ready to receive a character immediately. It's fairly easy to see 
that LISTST isn't really required in those cases where a printer is able to 
accept characters and print them as quickly as BDOS can send them, re- 
turning control to BDOS and the applications program that is running 
almost immediately. In such a case, LISTST should always return a 
ready status for those few programs that use it. On the other hand, if 
there's no printer connected, or if the LIST routine has not been imple- 
mented except as a simple RET instruction, then LISTST should always 
return not-ready status. 

Few, if any, printers are capable of accepting characters as fast as 
BDOS can send them, so there are very few situations in which LISTST 
should always return ready. The most common case, therefore, is that of 
a printer that accepts characters slowly. This case requires a LISTST rou- 
tine that either accurately checks whether the printer is ready and re- 
turns an appropriate response, or always returns not-ready. The latter 
may seem wrong, since there'll undoubtedly be times when the printer 
will be ready and LISTST will still indicate the opposite, but because of 
the way LISTST may be used, this is all right. BDOS does not itself use 
the LISTST routine to determine whether or not to output to the LST: 
device; nor should any program accessing LISTST use it to decide un- 
conditionally whether to output characters. 

Basically, since the LIST routine won't return when called until it has 
actually sent the character out, and since printers are slow, the LIST rou- 
tine is used as a method for programs that have the ability to do other

things while printing to tell whether they should go print a character or 
handle some other function. The program, however, should understand 
that it must eventually output the character whether LISTST indicates 
ready or not. 

Because of this last bit of discretion given the program — for exam- 
ple, that after twenty or so calls to LISTST, the program should output 
the character to LIST regardless of status — it is allowed to keep abreast 
of other developments and tasks during printing. In this case, programs 
that make use of this BIOS routine can be more efficient, since not so 
much time will be wasted looping in the LIST routine while waiting for 
the slow printer to accept the transmitted character. It must be remem- 
bered that no BDOS system call is available to check the status of the 
LST: device, and that BDOS itself does not use the LISTST routine. This 
means that a program using LISTST must call BIOS directly. 

The final topic in our discussion of printers is that of protocol. This 
term relates to the method of communication rather than to the commu- 
nication itself A good simple example of protocol can be found in radio 
communication, in which some method is needed to identify when one 
person is finished talking so the other one can begin. In radio transmis- 
sion, the word "over" is used to indicate the end of a transmission, and 
when the receiver hears this, he knows that it is now permissible to talk. 
This convention is said to be the protocol used in that communication. 

In the case we're dealing with here, the term protocol is used to de- 
scribe the specific method by which the computer communicates with the 
printer, from both a hardware and a software standpoint. There are 
really two types of communication going on — communication between 
the two pieces of hardware, and communication between the BIOS and 
the firmware inside the printer or on its interface. Generally speaking, 
these protocols only pertain to serial devices using the established RS-232 
standard for serial communication, although a limited form of hardware 
protocol is available with parallel interfaces as well. 

For our purposes, we can say that the hardware protocol specifies 
which of the lines (wires) in the serial interface will be used to control the 
timing and sequence of the data involved in the communications. Since 



this isn't primarily a hardware column, we won't go into this in detail. 
Suffice it to say that it is very important in the physical connection of 
equipment that some hardware protocol be followed to enable the hard- 
ware in the computer interface to communicate properly with the hard- 
ware in the printer. All of the software in the world won't overcome a ba- 
sic error in such connections. (Those wishing further information on this 
subject should consult a good data communications reference work such 
as Data Communications for Microcomputers, by Nichols, Nichols, and 
Musson, McGraw-Hill, 1982.) 

Assuming correct hardware protocol, it is the job of the software in 
the computer to communicate properly with the software and firmware 
contained on the interface card or in the printer itself. Normally, with 
printers and interfaces designed specifically for the Apple, such consid- 
erations are unnecessary, since the interface card firmware is designed to 
handle any protocol measures required. But in situations where the 
printer interface is a standard serial card and the printer contains a cer- 
tain amount of intelligence (that is, processing power) that expects a cer- 
tain protocol, it's up to the software, preferably the system software, to 
provide that protocol. 

The purpose of such protocol is to control the flow of data from the 
transmitter (the computer) to the receiver (the printer), where the former 
is considerably faster than the latter. This is done in order to prevent the 
transmitter from sending so many characters that it overflows the receiv- 
er's ability to process them, with the result that data is lost. 

Normally, a printer has a memory buffer that is filled as characters 
are received from the transmitter and emptied as the printer prints them 
on paper. Since the speed at which the printer can print is so much slow- 
er than the speed at which the computer can transmit, it's possible for the 
buffer to overflow. 

With most Apple peripherals, buffer overflow is controlled by using a 
part of the hardware protocol in the printer or interface to send a not- 
ready signal when the buffer gets full and a ready signal when the buffer 
is able to accept more. There are, however, printers which, because 
they have been designed for use on other machines besides the Apple, do

not make use of this type of control. For them, the ready/ not-ready sig- 
nals are reserved for the actual communication with the buffer; for exam- 
ple, a character is placed on the communications circuit and while that 
character is being received and placed in the buffer, the not-ready status 
is used. As soon as the character is stored, the ready status comes back 
on and the next character is sent. No check of overall buffer level is made 
by the hardware. 

It should be noted that if the speed at which data is transmitted is 
slow enough, the printer will be able to print characters as fast as they are 
received, using the ready/ not-ready states of the communications link to 
slow the computer down. You may have seen, for example, that with 
some serial printers, a I2(X)-baud transmission speed is the highest rec- 
ommended for use without protocol, even though the printer itself may 
be capable of receiving at twice that speed or higher. There are two very 
basic software protocol methods that eliminate such speed mismatch 
problems; they are ETX/ACK and XON/XOFF. 

When the ETX/ACK method is used, the transmitter sends a fixed- 
size block of data (smaller than the buffer in the printer), followed by a 
special end-of-text, or ETX, character. This is one of the ASCII control 
characters, an 03. The transmitter then stops transmitting and waits. The 
receiver processes the block of data, and when it encounters the ETX at 
the end it sends back to the transmitter an acknowledge, or ACK, 
another special control character whose value is 06. The transmitter, 
which has been waiting, gets the ACK from the receiver and transmits 
the next block of letters, ensuring that the receiver is ready for the data 
before it is transmitted. 

The XON/XOFF method has an identical purpose but is structured 
differently. In this case, there are two buffer level values that the receiver 
can detect — nearly full and nearly empty. As the receiver gets characters 
from the transmitter and the buffer fills, the receiver is also processing the 
characters, but at a slower rate. The receiver therefore constantly checks 
the buffer level, and when it detects a nearly full condition it sends an 
XOFF character to the transmitter, which quits transmitting in re- 
sponse. As the buffer empties, a nearly empty mark is reached. This is de- 
tected by the receiver, which sends an XON to the transmitter and the 
transmitter begins transmitting again. With this method, the receiver is 
constantly processing data, but the buffer never overflows. 

Since most printers designed specifically for the Apple don't require 
such protocol (and indeed are not able to handle the protocol by ignor- 
ing it if it is sent anyway), the SoftCard BIOS does not implement either 
of these protocol methods. To have done so would have taken up a not 
insignificant amount of memory and would have required additional 
routines to activate and deactivate them as well. In this case, the space 
that would have been taken up by the protocol routines (and thereby lost 
to the user) was considered more valuable than the ability to handle the 
relatively rare occurrence of a printer requiring the protocol. 

This sacrificing of adaptability for increased user program space 
probably has some advocates as well as some critics. Two things do 
make it unfortunate, though — how difficult it is for users in the field to 
implement such protocols themselves, and the fact that some printers will 
not work without them. While it's not impossible to install the protocols 
and still use the LST: device, it's made especially difficult, since both 
ETX/ACK and XON/XOFF require the printer to send characters 
back to the user, and there's no BDOS system call that can be made by 
an applications program to get a character of input from the printer. 

Such a task would require BIOS modification or patching, possibly 
accomplished through the use of the LISTST roufine as a direct BIOS 
call to return an ACK character generated by the printer, or as a direct 
call to be constantly polled as a source of XON/XOFF characters. 
Another method might be to write a specific printer driver that imple- 
mented protocol for one's application and to place it in the patch area, 
substituting it for the normal LIST routine. Users of specific applica- 
tions programs (such as Wordstar) could just write their own direct print- 
er drivers that performed the necessary two-way communications with a 
peripheral card in a specific slot. This solution would work only for that 
specific application, however. 

A word of warning The programming tasks in all the cases just men- 
tioned are certainly achievable, but are not trivial. If there's sufficient in- 
terest, we might take up such a task in a future column. 

The final type of protocol we'll examine involves the use of parity. 



This protocol is not used for the same purpose as those we have 
examined so far; rather, parity is used as a limited form of error-check- 
ing. As we've said before, the parity bit is the highest order, or leftmost, 
bit of the eight bits in a byte. CP/M itself does not use the parity bit in 
normal character output with either the console device or the printer. 
Some printers, however, may be set to use it or not, and some interfaces 
are programmable to deal with it. 

Basically, the concept of parity is structured around the fact that each 
eight-bit byte is a collection of binary Is and Os. Any collection of bits is 
said to have either even parity or odd parity, depending on the number of 
Is in the collection. An odd number of Is indicates odd parity, and an 
even number indicates even parity. 

It can be seen, therefore, that if you wished to transmit only seven 
bytes of useful data during communication, the eighth bit, or parity bit, 
could be set or reset as necessary to make the bits all odd parity or even 
parity, depending on which protocol was in effect. When the parity bit is 
always reset to 0, the system is said to be "no parity." 

When both parties in the communications link are adjusted to trans- 
mit in odd (or even) parity mode, a constant check can be made on the 
bytes being transmitted, and when the wrong parity appears, the receiver 
can reject the block of data by forcing an error condition and abort the 
transmission or request another transmission of that block of data if the 
system allows that to take place. In the cases of printers in general, and 
printers working with CP/M, there's little point in implementing this ac- 
tivity. CP/M will not accept an error condition reported back from a 
printer, and indeed, with the short transmission lines that are ordinarily 
used, errors of this type are unlikely anyway. (When such an error does 
occur, rare though it may be, it's usually best to ignore it or to repeat the 
process from the beginning.) For this reason, CP/M doesn't make use of 
parity, and neither does the SoftCard BIOS. 

It's dme now to examine the SoftCard BIOS and see just exactly 
what the LIST and LISTST routines are capable of. Of the two, LISTST 
is by far the simpler. As the sixteenth entry in the BIOS jump table, 
LISTST is supposed to return a 00 if the device is not-ready and an 
OFFH if the device is ready. Since most printers connected to the Apple 
are considerably slower than SoftCard, LISTST in the SoftCard BIOS al- 
ways returns not-ready. This is accomplished by replacing the jump to 
the list status routine (a three-byte instruction) with an XOR A, vMdi 
zeros the [A] register, and a RET, to return the BDOS with the zero 
value. To keep the jump table intact, so that every entry is three bytes 
long, a NOP (no operation) instruction is placed after the RET. In Soft- 
Card, then, LISTST is always not-ready. 

The LIST routine, which is the sixth entry in the jump table, con- 
tains a jump instruction to the address 0DB66H in 56K CP/M and 
0AB66H in 44K. This routine, like the other character I/O routines, first 
examines the lOBYTE value to see which of the physical devices is cur- 
rently the active LST: device. 

The four devices available for LST: are TTY:, CRT:, LPT:, and 
ULl:. Just as we saw in the console device in previous columns, TTY: 
and CRT: are combined into a single device (which we called TTY:) and 
are serviced by the TTYOUT driver routine. Therefore, when LIST 
checks the lOBYTE, values of 00 or 01 cause control to be transferred to 
TTYOUT. Character output handled in this fashion is identical to that 
performed by means of the console device, CON:, and by referring back 
to the column on that device you can see how character output 
progresses. 

An lOBYTE value of 02 designates the LPT: device, commonly 
called the line printer. This device is serviced by a routine whose address 
is stored in List Output Vector #1 in the lOCB. If an 02 is found in the 
lOBYTE, the address contained in the number one vector is loaded into 
the [HL] register pair and branched to via a JP (HL) instruction. 

Had the lOBYTE value been 03, the ULl: device (user-defined list 
device) would have been the active one. This device is handled by a rou- 
tine whose address is stored in List Output Vector #2, and so the address 
loaded into the (HL) register pair would be from that vector location. 
When the SoftCard is shipped, no user-defined list device exists, and so 
the same address— that of the LSTOUl routine (at 0DD2BH in 56K, at 
0AD2BH in 44K) — is contained in both vectors. 

The LSTOUl routine— Uke RDRINl and PUNOUl, discussed last 
month — simply loads the (DE) register pair with the slot value of the

worth 




The new Transtar 130 daisy wheel 
printer generates a full-page letter in 
78 seconds. The least expensive 40 cps 
printer does it in 36. Only 42 seconds 
difference. ..for twice the price. 
At only $895, the Transtar 130 letter- 
quality printer makes speed its only 
compromise. Shannon-text rated at 
16 cps, the Transtar 130 gives you better 
printing quality than any 40 cps printer. 
It allows you the full range of word- 
processing functions such as proportional 
spacing, superscript, subscript, under- 
scoring and a true boldface. The 130 is 
"plug and go" compatible with the best- 



selling word processing packages. It's 
quiet: only65dB. It's durable. It boasts 
a unique new autoload feature that auto- 
matically loads paper to one of four pre- 
selected positions with the touch of a 
button. And, as if that weren't enough, 
its end-user warranty runs a full six 
months— twice that of most of its com- 
petitors. 

Affordable and loaded with all the 
features of printers costing twice as 
much, the Transtar 130 letter-quality 
printer retails for less than $900. But 
it's up to you: Is 42 seconds really 
worth $1000?

printer device (slot 1) and jumps to one of three hardware routines or to 
a dummy routine if no card is installed in slot 1. Initially, the address 
jumped to is that of a simple RET instruction at 0DD3EH. This address 
is altered by the BOOT routine during initial system boot-up if any 
usable card has been detected in slot 1. The usable card in this case is a 
serial card, an Apple Communications card, or an Apple parallel printer 
card. These cards are serviced by the routines WSER, WCOM, and 
WPAR, which we've discussed in detail in previous columns. BOOT 
therefore places the address of one of these three routines in the address 
field of the jump instruction in LSTOUl as the system boots up. Which- 
ever routine LSTOUl branches to uses the slot value in (DE) to find the 
firmware routines and/or control addresses for the card in that slot and 
uses these to send output appropriately. 

It must be noted once again that in the case of comm cards, the prob- 
lem encountered before in the PUNCH routine is just as prevalent here. 
Because of the type of chip in use on the comm card, and the fact 
that the Z-80 does a preread before every write, the output of a byte to 
the comm card cannot be done in Z-80 mode. Fixing this problem would 
involve installing a patch similar to OUTPAT (which we discussed some 
months ago) into the patch area and altering the List Output Vectors. It 
should be noted, however, that the use of comm cards as printer inter- 
faces is rare, so such a patch is probably not necessary. 

WSER, WCOM, and WPAR all return directly to BDOS after hav- 
ing transmitted the character data to their respective cards. No check is 
made by BDOS to ensure that the character was sent, however, since 
control is not supposed to be returned to BDOS until the transmission of 
the character is complete. (It is for this reason that sending output to 
a printer that is not on or not-ready causes the system to hang. This does 
not occur if no printer card is installed, of course, because the address of 
the RET instruction is left intact by BOOT if no card is detected in that 
slot.) 

We've now covered the LIST and LISTST routines and completed 
our in-depth discussion of SoftCard's specific character I/O routines. To 
summarize, then, let's take a look at how BDOS and applications pro- 
grams use the overall character I/O system. First, there are six specific

character I/O routines in the BIOS that BDOS can use to satisfy its nine 
system calls, and one (the LISTST routine) that, if necessary, can be ac- 
cessed directly. The nine numbered BDOS system calls follow: 
Number Function 



Console Input 
Console Output 
Reader Input 
Punch Output 
List Output 
Direct Console I/O 



Purpose 

Get one character from the CON; device. 
Send one character to the CON: device. 
Get one character from the RDR: device. 
Send one character to the PUN: device. 
Send one character to the LSI; device. 
Check and if available get one character 
from the CON: device or send one 
character to the CON: device. 
Send multiple characters to the CON: 
device from memory buffer terminated by 
ASCII $ character. 

Get multiple characters of input from the 
CON: device and store in designated 
buffer. 

Return a value of 00 if no character is 
available from CON: or OFFH if a 
character is available. 

To perform these functions, BDOS uses the following BIOS routines: 



9. Print String 



10. Read Console Buffer

Purpose 

Determine character availability from 
CON: 

Get a character from CON: 
Send a character to CON: 
Get a character from RDR: 
Send a character to PUN 
Send a character to LST: 
Determine readiness of LST: 



As you can see from this list, BDOS uses only CONST, CONIN, and 
CONOUT of the BIOS routines on its own or as part of another func- 
tion. The remaining BIOS routines are accessed by BEXDS only on direct 
request from an applications program. A minimum BIOS, therefore, on- 
ly requires that the first three routines be fully functional from BDOS's 
standpoint, and in fact many older CP/M systems were shipped with 
only these three routines implemented, leaving the other routines to be 
implemented by users themselves. 

In the SoftCard system, the four devices, CON:, RDR:, PUN:, and 
LST:, have been assigned specific slots for the sake of simplicity. CON:, 
if used as an external device (instead of the forty-column screen), is as- 
signed slot 3; RDR: and PUN:, since they each may make up either the 
input or the output half of a bidirectional device, have been assigned to 
share slot 2, while LST: has been assigned slot 1. 

The BIOS was designed to recognize Apple standard cards of the se- 
rial, comm, or parallel type automatically in each of these three slots and 
to initialize and communicate properly with the card when the appropri- 
ate device is called. In this way, for most standard applications, all of the 
BIOS routines (and consequently the BDOS system calls) were designed 
to function without user modification. With the exception of the comm 
card problems and possible problems with protocol we've mentioned, 
the BIOS fulfills this original design criteria. 

Recognizing, however, that individual users might need to imple- 
ment some different device in one of these categories, BIOS was con- 
structed with two physical devices that could be assigned to each logical 
device or category. In this way, the user could have an alternative physi- 
cal device of his own in addition to the standard physical device avail- 
able for each of the functions. 

While in theory this appeared to be an optimum solution, and while 
all the information necessary to accomplish this task was included in 
some form in the SoftCard manuals, in practice the task itself required 
that more tutorial information and guidance be available to most Soft- 
Card users than the manuals could provide. To a large degree, that's the 
reason for the existence of this column; its purpose has always been to 
provide additional information concerning the BIOS and the overall 
function of CP/M, with the goal being a better informed and more ca- 
pable SoftCard user community. 

In coming installments of the column (once we've examined the disk 
1/0 routines, of course), we'll consider examples of installation of rou- 
tines to handle special peripheral devices. In addition, we'll look at ways 
the BIOS can be altered to be more effective in dealing with peripherals 
already recognized. Until next month. ... Hi

Everyone's Guide to Assembly Language, Part 32 

Last month's column presented a listing for a hi-res character gen- 
erator and the theory behind its operation. The generator used an exist- 
ing character set, loaded at location $9000 in memory, and contained the 
data for ninety-six ASCII characters. 

To create your own character set, all that is needed is a utility for 
editing the existing character set and creating the new font, or character 
design, that you desire. 

Before presenting the listing for the character editor, consider for a 
moment the information and techniques that must be provided for. This 
is a very important part of solving any problem, programming or other- 
wise, and is instrumental in directing and clarifying one's thought 
processes. 

In discussing the character set, you'll recall that each character is repi- 
resented by a series of eight bytes in the table, and that each dot in the 
character image is represented by a bit within one of those bytes. The 
first two considerations, therefore, are how to address the series of bytes 
that correspond to a given ASCII character and how to identify and alter 
the bit corresponding to the particular dot in the character image that we 
wish to modify. 

In editing each character, we will want to be able to turn a given bit 
on or off (set it to 1 or 0) and to move a cursor from one bit to another. 
You'll also recall from last month that each byte of the character data 
corresponds to one Une of the saeen image. Within each byte, seven bits 
are used to map the seven screen dots used to generate a character. 

When we edit the individual screen dots, it would be nice if we could 
use the standard directional keys, I, J, K, and M, to move the cursor 
around in the box representing the character image. 

Speaking of the character box, some thought will have to be given to 
how the entire character itself will be displayed. We could just print the 
character on-screen each time a modification was done, but because of 
the small size this would become tedious after a while. A better ap- 
proach would be to display a magnified image of the character, upon 
which our cursor can be positioned to edit any particular bit in the over- 
all image. 

To use the editor, we'll also have to be able to specify the character 
we want to edit, and then to signify later when we are done. To keep 
things simple, we'll select a character by pressing the equivalent key and 
store the completed image back in the character table when the return 
key is pressed. 

Loading and saving of the complete table is not provided for in the 
editor but can be accomplished easily from the immediate mode with 
bload and bsave. More on that later. 

Here, then, is the complete listing, which will be explained in detail. 
See you at the bottom!

Anger 



"POWER 

Goodbye valuable data. Unless 
you have a Guardian Angel uninter- 
ruptable power source on duty. 

Guardian Angel switches to 150 
watts of backup power in 1/100 of a 
second or less while alerting you of 
blackout or brownout conditions. 
Its rugged 12V battery gives you up 
to six minutes ( 15 at half-rated 
power), enough to save your data 
and shut down your system if line 
power does not return. 

Guardian Angel is compatible 
with virtually every major micro- 
computer system, including Apple, 
IBM, H-P, TRS-80, Xerox, Eagle 
and Osborne. Its transient voltage 
suppressor also prevents system 
damage from power spikes. 

Guardian Angel simply plugs 
in between your power source and 
your microcomputer. Its compact 
size permits either desktop use or 
out of the way placement. 

Protect your investment: see 
your R.H. Electronics 
dealer today about 
Guardian Angel or 
contact us at 
566 Irelan Street, 
Buellton, CA 93427, 
(805) 688-2047. 




with LED power 
status indicator, 
automatically safe- 
guards data from

After assembling the listing, bload the character set from last month 
at location $9000. Then bload the character editor at $8000 (do not brun) 
and type call 24576 from Applesoft or 8000G from the Monitor 
(Applesoft must be the selected language, though). 

When the program is called, the screen will clear and a box with a 
matrix pattern inside it will appear, along with the complete character set 
loaded at $9000. If the characters appear scrambled, recheck to make 
sure you have loaded the character set properly at $9000. 

To select a character to edit, simply press any noncontrol key. An en- 
larged image of that character should appear in the box. To move the 
editing cursor around, use the left and right arrows to move left and 
right, and control-J and control-K to move up and down. If you have an 
Apple He, the four directional arrows will also work. Even on a stan- 
dard Apple II, you may find it easier to hold down the control key with 
the little finger of your left hand and then press the H, U, J, and K keys 
with the right hand to move around. 

Pressing escape will toggle bits in the character on and off. To save a 



character back to the table, press return. If you want to start over with a 
character, simply press the original letter key again. 

To save the altered table back to disk, simply press reset, and then 
type: 

BSAVE TABLENAME, A$9000, L$300 

You can replace Tablename with any name you wish to give the new 
character set. 

How It Works. Although the listing looks rather long, don't be dis- 
couraged. As it happens, much of the listing consists of routines that 
were presented in earlier issues. For example, lines 243 through 313 
(HCOUT) are the character generator that was described in the last 
issue. 

To see how the editor works, let's first consider this overview of the 
program: 

HOOK: Hooks up the character generator, HCOUT, to the output 
vectors so that the hi-res characters can be printed. 

ENTRY: Qears the hi-res screen and initializes the column and row 
counters to zero. 

CHRLIST: This section prints all ninety-six ASCII characters to the 
screen. We'll examine part of the process in detail shortly. 

MATDSP: This section draws the matrix pattern to indicate where 
the character will be edited. This is also the entry point for the editing 
loop for each character. This section can be broken dovm as follows: 
BOX: The Applesoft hi-res routines are used to draw a box 
with four straight lines. This forms the boundary of the matrix 
area. 

GET ROW: Each byte of the matrix pattern is retrieved here, 
after which SCAN will process and display the individual bits. 

SCAN: This section shifts each bit of the row into the carry 
and, depending on whether it's set or not, displays a solid or an 
empty block. 

NXTRO W : Increments the row counter (the Y raster) until 
all eight rows have been displayed. 

CURSOR: Calculates the current cursor position using CC 
(cursor column) and CR (cursor row). 

CURCALC: This part, along with PRNTCURS, determines 
whether the bit at the cursor position is set or not. If it is set, a 
white cursor is printed. If not, an outline of the cursor is displayed. 
CMD?: At this point we are ready to get a command from the key- 
board. The general theory is to refresh the screen with the routines in 
MATDSP each time a command is entered. That way we don't have to 
update only part of the screen specifically. 

If a control character is entered, it is assumed that it will either be a 
directional key or return, so control is passed to EDIT. 

If a noncontrol character is entered, it is assumed that this is a char- 
acter to be edited. MOVE then retrieves the eight bytes for that char- 
acter and moves them to the work area (MAT). 

EDIT: If the user presses return, ACCEPT will store the character 
data back in the table. If escape is pressed, the bit within the byte for that 
row will be toggled. 

If one of the directional keys is pressed, the position counters CC and 
CR are adjusted accordingly. 

Pressing a control key other than the legal command characters will 
generate a bell sound. In any case, after a key is entered, a jump is made 
back to MATDSP to start the process over again. 

And Now with the Magnifying Glass. The preceding overview 
showed in general how the editor works. Now we'll spend a little more 
time examining the particular techniques used in each routine. Some of 
the routines taken from earlier issues will not be described in as much de- 
tail as those presented here for the first time. You may wish to refer to 
previous sections if some parts seem difficult. To help you scan through 
to just the parts that interest you, each section is keyed to the preceding 
overview. 

HOOK. By storing the address of the HCOUT routine in CSW and 
then calling VECT ($3EA), all future output will pass through the 
HCOUT routine, allowing us to print the hi-res characters on the screen. 

ENTRY. This is the main entry point to the editor; it serves to clear 
the hi-res screen and initialize the column and row position of the cursor

to 0,0 (upper-left corner of the matrix). 

CHRLIST. To display all the existing characters, CHRLIST loops 
through the values #$20 through #$7F (32 through 128 = 96 characters). 
Because we can't print 96 characters on one line, some sort of aesthetic 
placement is desirable. The format chosen was a group of 6 lines of 16 
characters each. 

START is the beginning of this loop (X register set to #$20), and 
CH2 is the top of the printing loop. An interesting problem here is how 
to determine each time we have printed 16 characters. A separate count- 
er could have been kept, but if it were possible to do a modulo function 
we could just test for our current character counter for multiples of 16. 
Because modulo returns the remainder of a division, we would expect a 
result of zero each time the counter was at a multiple of 1 6, or in other 
words, had just finished another line of 16 characters. 

As it happens, the AND instruction can be used to perform the 
equivalent of a modulo for any power of 2. The technique is to do an 
AND with the value you want minus 1. Because 16 is a power of 2 (2 a 4 
= 16), we need only do an AND #$0F followed by a BNE to test for 
each completed line of 16 characters. 

If a line has been finished, a carriage return is printed, followed by 
the equivalent of an htab 20. 

Notice that as each character is printed the high bit is set with an 
ORA #$80. This is to make COUT happy, as it always expects the high 
bit to be set on characters to be printed. 

MATDSP. This section begins the part that creates the matrix dis- 
play used in editing the individual characters. This section will be repeat- 
ed each time a command character is entered. 

The first part, BOX, draws a box outlining the character image using 
the Applesoft HLIN routines. 

Once the box is drawn, the individual bytes must be displayed with 
the status of each bit indicated. The algorithm is to scan through each bit 
position, printing a space if the bit is clear and printing a rubout (#$FF) if 
the bit is set. In last month's character table, a rubout was a solid block, 
so this approach should work. (Note that, if you edit the space charac- 
ter, the matrix pattern will be altered accordingly.) 

There are a total of eight bytes to be retrieved and displayed for each 
character. GRl is the section that does the equivalent of an htab 5 (for 
proper screen placement) and then loads a byte from the work area 
MAT (see line 225). Once a byte is retrieved, SCAN uses the LSR in- 
struction to shift a bit into the carry flag. If the carry is set, a rubout 
(#$FF) is printed; otherwise a space (#$A0). 

Because the accumulator will be used to print a character via COUT, 
the shifted byte is preserved by pushing it onto the stack on line 98, and 
later pulling it back off on line 103. 

After each seven bits are "printed," a carriage return is printed on 
lines 107 and 108 and the loop is repeated until all eight bytes have been 
displayed. 

CURSOR. Once the character matrix has been displayed, we need to 
display the cursor. Lines 115 through 123 use the cursor row and col- 
umn (CR and CC) to calculate the htab, vtab position. Remember that 
since we are mirroring actions taken on the text page we can also use the 
text page as a frame of reference for hi-res screen operations. 

STATUS is used to read the particular bit that corresponds to the 
current cursor position. Note that CR (cursor row) is conveniently equal 
to which byte in the individual character definition we will need to read, 
and that CC (cursor column) determines how many bits need to be shift- 
ed out to put the one of interest into the carry flag. Depending on wheth- 
er the bit is clear or set, the accumulator will be loaded with a #$00 or 
#$08, the purpose of which will become immediately obvious. 

PRNTCURS. Since CH and CV ($24,$25) have been set up, we can 
use a special form of the HCOUT routine, called PRNTCURS, to print 
a smaller block or a block outline. You'll notice that the hi-res character 
generator at HCOUT has been modified slightly to use the pointer 
POSN ($3C,3D) to point to the data table. Our original character gen- 
erator always assumed that the table would be at $9000. Normally 
HCOUT sets POSN to point at $9000 on lines 278 through 285. 

With POSN set up to point at a special two-character definition table 
on lines 227 through 243, the PUTBYTE routine will do the equiv- 
alent of printing one of the two necessary special characters at 



the cursor position. 

You may wish to compare the HCOUT routine contained in the edi- 
tor with last month's character generator to see what changes have been 
made to facilitate the calling by the PRNTCURS routine. 

An interesting digression: By avoiding COUT and writing to the 
screen directly, we are on the verge of being able to do block shapes, a 
technique used in many hi-res arcade-type games. 

CMD?. The processing of the command characters is done in this 
section. The character is read from the keyboard using the Monitor rou- 
tine RDKEY ($FDOC). This routine will place the ASCII value for the 
key pressed into the accumulator. 

The first major distinction to be made is whether or not a control 
character has been pressed. Lines 145 and 146 do this, forwarding any 
control characters to the EDIT section. 

If a noncontrol character has been pressed, the user wants to edit that 
character. CHAR and MOVE use the ASCII value of the key pressed to 
calculate the position of the data of that character in the table, and then 
move that data into the work area, MAT. After the move, a jump is 
made back to MATDSP to refresh the display with the new character 
and to get the next command key. 

EDIT. If a control key is pressed, one of a number of functions must 
be performed. We will consider these in the order they are executed. 

Return: This implies that the user wants to accept the character as 
displayed and copy it back into the character table. This is done by es- 
sentially reversing the process used by CHAR and MOVE (lines 147 
through 153). 

Toggle. If escape is pressed, the appropriate bit position must be 
switched to its opposite condition — off to on or on to off. This is done by 
creating a mask byte with the proper bit set. To do this, the carry flag is 
set and the accumulator loaded with a zero. When an ROL is done, this 
set bit will be shifted through the accumulator. By doing the ROL a 
given number of times (determined by CC) we can set a given bit in the 
MASK byte ($08). 

Once the mask has been created, we need only retrieve the proper 
byte from the work area (determined by CR) and then mask it with 
MASK byte (lines 178 through 180). Once this is done, we again jump 
back to MATDSP to refresh the display and get the next character. 

Cursor control. To move the cursor around, we'll use the four direc- 
tional keys on the Apple He keyboard. Even if you don't have a He, you 
can generate the same characters in the manner mentioned earlier in this 
article. To refresh your memory, the keys we'll use will be control H, U, 
J, and K, for left, right, down, and up respectively. 

The code on lines 185 through 219 is fairly straightforward. The up 
and down motions are done by incrementing or decrementing the cursor 
row counter and left and right motions by incrementing or deaemenl- 
ing the cursor column counter. All motions wrap around. 

Miscellaneous Notes. You must use reset to exit this program as no 
exit-key provision has been made. 

Although they can be displayed, lower-case characters may not be 
easy to edit, since they are not easily generated from the Apple II key- 
board. Apple He owners will have no trouble. It is possible to use the 
lower-case input routine described in an earlier issue to generate lower- 
case characters from a standard Apple II keyboard. Simply activate the 
routine prior to calling the character editor. The escape shift functions 
will continue to work properly, with presumably no ill effects on the 
editor routines. 

It is worth noting that the character sets used and created by this 
editor are identical in format to the DOS Tool Kit Animatrix character 
sets, although the character editor provided with that package does have 
one or two minor, though not inconsequenfial, features not available in 
this editor. 

Conclusion. This concludes the current discussion of hi-res character 
generation and editing, and should provide you with the basic principles 
of these techniques. The idea can be extended into block graphics for 
arcade-style games or as improvements to the art of hi-res character gen- 
erafion. You might, for example, want to experiment with oversize 
letters, colored text, or simple animation. 

As usual, any comments regarding this or other columns are 
welcomed and encouraged. m

Exploring Business Basic, Part 20 

Greetings, Basic buffs! This month's article 
continues the never-ending (or so it seems) 
saga of graphics capabilities on the Apple 
III. We've got a lot of material to go over, 
and after several months at this it will be as- 
sumed that you are pretty familiar with the con- 
cepts. This installment will cover the last tech- 
nique for character graphic animation, and then 
plunge headlong into the Apple III bit-mapped 
display, most notably the 140-by-192 sixteen- 
color mode. 

A Last Issue from Last Time, As you may 
remember, one of the major events from last 
time was the use of the character download ca- 
pability of the .console driver to create smooth 
animation by rapid switching of character defi- 
nitions. We proved how powerful the tech- 
nique was by smoothly scrolling hundreds of lit- 
tle bug heads from one side of the screen to the 
other. The question that somewhat naturally 
came up was, "How can I move just one head 
across the screen?" Curiously enough, it's a lit- 
tle harder; so it's worth showing a program in 
order to help you accomplish it. If you read last 
month's column, you'll notice a fair amount of 
similarity in structure with other programs in 
that article. 

The trick last time to moving lots of bug 
heads smoothly was to print alternating sets of 
character 128 and character 129 across the 
screen and then download successive defini- 
tions of each character. The progression of defi- 
nitions showed the head making a step-by-step 
transition from one character cell to the other. 
Since a character cell is seven dots wide, it takes 
eight steps to move a head from completely 
within one cell to completely within the next 
one. By reversing the process for every other 
cell, the illusion of smooth motion is created. To 
create the character-cell definitions, we used the 
font and shape editor described in the Febru- 
ary issue (part 17). However, in case you missed 
that issue, or couldn't summon the strength to 
type the whole thing in, the following program 
uses data statements to define the bug-head 
transitions. Feel free to edit your own head defi- 
nitions and substitute the appropriate routine if 
you want. 



d n 



As was mentioned previously, moving a sin- 
gle head across the screen is a little trickier than 
flipping one character definition to the next. 
The simplest solution is to print a string of char- 
acters across the screen, each one a different 
character number, but initially all defined to ap- 
pear as a blank. The program can then redefine 
the characters, one at a time, and give the ap- 
pearance of motion across the screen as each 
successive character is given the head defini- 
tion. The following program illustrates one way 
to use this approach to solve the problem: 

10 DIM a%(511),ctrlist$(7),head1$(6), 
head2$(6) 

20 IN VOKE'Vbasic/download.inv", "/basic/ 

request. inv" 
30 q$=CHR$(34):array$ = "a%":name$ = 

".console" 
40 fg$ = CHR$(19):bg$ = CHR$(20) 
50 mblue$ = CHR$(6):white$ = CHR$(15) 
60 bw$=fg$+mblue$+bg$+white$ 
70 text40$=CHR$(16)+CHR$(1) 

Line 10 defines various arrays to be used in 
the program. CtrlistS contains the character re- 
definitions for downloading to the character 
generator, and the two headS arrays contain 
definitions of the bug head coming and going. 
The other lines establish constants that will be 
used later. 

Now, to initialize the data and get ready to 
scroll, we will use several routines, which will be 
discussed in turn: 

80 GOSUB 700:REM get the head definitions 
90 GOSUB 800:REM load the print line 
100 GOSUB 900:REM set up control strings 
110 GOSUB 600:REM set up screen 

The first routine loads the head definitions, 
in this case from data statements: 

700 RESTORE 

710 FOR 1 = 0 TO 6 

715 head1$(i) = "":head2$(i)="" 

720 FOR j=0 TO 3 

725 READ a%:h$ = HEX$(a%) 

730 head1$(i) = head1$(i)+CHR$(TEN 

(MID$(h$,1,2)))+CHR$(TEN(MID$ 

(h$,3,2))) 
735 NEXT j 
740 FOR j = 0 TO 3 
745 READ a%:h$ = HEX$(a%) 
750 head2$(i) = head2$(i)+CHR$(TEN 

(MID$(h$,1,2)))+CHR$(TEN(MID$ 



(h$,3,2))) 
755 NEXT j 
760 NEXT i 
765 RETURN

The head-loading routine is identical to one 
discussed last time, so you're on your own. If 
you want to use a font editor to create the 
heads, just load up the headS arrays in the same 
sequence as found in the data statements (ar- 
ranged as they would appear in an actual font 
definition). 

Next comes the routine to create a print 
string for the screen and to redefine all the char- 
acters in it to blanks; 

800 line$ = "" 

810 FOR i = 0 TO 31 

820 line$=line$ + CHR$(128 + i) 

830 NEXT i 

840 crO$ = CHR$(0) 

850 ctrl$ = CHR$(1)+crO$ + crO$ + 

crO$ + crO$+crO$+crO$+crO$ + 

crO$ + crO$ 
860 FOR i = 0 TO 31 
870 SUB$(Ctrl$,2,1)=CHR$(i) 
880 PERFORM control(% 1 7,@ctrl$) 

name$ 
890 NEXT I 
895 RETURN 

Notice in lines 810 through 830 that lineS is 
built containing all the characters from 128 
through 159, which are the displayable versions 
of character definitions 0 through 31. We could 
have used more characters, but it is necessary to 
skip character number 32 (space) or risk rede- 
fining every space character on the screen. As 
long as we just redefine control characters (0 
through 31), we won't disturb anything impor 
tant. Of course, with some thought, you can 
build lineS to any reasonable length. 

Next comes the routine that defines the 
character download strings, defining the suc- 
cessive versions of the characters: 

900 FOR 1= 1 TO 6 

905 ctrlist$(i) = CHR$(2) + 

CHR$(0)+head1$(i)+CHR$(1) + 
head2$(i) 

910 ctrb$(i) = CHR$(1)+CHR$(0) 
+ head2$(l) 

915 ctre$(i) = CHR$(1) + CHR$(31) 
+ head1$(i) 

920 NEXT I 

925 ctrlist$(7) = CHR$(2) + CHR$(0) 

+ head2$(0)+CHR$(1)+head1$(0) 

930 ctrb$(7)=CHR$(1)+CHR$(0) + 
head1$(0) 

935 ctre$(7)=CHR$(1) + CHR$(31) + 
head2$(0) 

940 RETURN 

in addition to the ctrlistS definitions, which 
define the transitions of the characters in the 
middle of the screen, there are two special ar- 
rays, ctrbS and ctreS. Qrb$ is the head defini- 
tion as it appears on-screen in the leftmost char- 
acter position, while ctreS is the definition of the 
rightmost character, as it disappears. 

Lastly comes the screen .setup routine: 

600 PRINT text40$;bw$ 
605 PRINT CHR$(21),"9"; 
610 HOME:PRINT:PRINT 
620 RETURN 

This just turns on the forty-column mode, 
sets the color to blue on a white background, 
turns off character wrap (line 605), and clears 
the screen to white. 

Now the fun begins: 

120 PRINT line$; 

150 ON KBD GOTO 200 



160 FOR i= 1 TO 7:PERF0RM control 

(%17,@ctrb$(i))name$:NEXT 
165 FOR x = 0 TO 30:FOR i= 1 TO 7 
170 SUB$(ctrlist$(i),2,1)=CHR$(x) 

:SUB$(ctrlist$(i),11,1) 

= CHR$(x+ 1) 
175 PERFORM control(%17, 

@ctrlist$(i))name$ 
180 NEXT:NEXT 
185 FOR 1= 1 TO 7:PERF0RM control 

(% 1 7,@ctre$(i))name$: NEXT 
190 GOTO 160 

We stated earlier that the animation would 
occur by successively redefining our string of 
characters. Line 120 prints the character string 
on-screen, and line 150 sets up an on kbd jump 
to exit from the scrolling. Scrolling begins in line 
160 by successively redefining the first charac- 
ter in the string through the seven phases re- 
quired to bring the head fully into the first char- 
acter position. Lines 165 through 180 then set 
up a major loop to proceed through the char- 
acters in iineS (remember that they are now 
printed on the screen), taking each through the 
seven-phase redefinition necessary for the 
smooth scrolling. Notice that the same ctrlistS 
definition is used each time, with the appropri- 
ate character numbers plugged in in line 170. If 
you are unsure as to how the perform-control 
statement works, review last month's article, the 
section in the Standard Device Drivers Manual 
on console control functions, and the Re- 
quest. inv documentation on the Basic disk. 

All that remains now of our program is the 
keyboard service routine at line 200 and the 
cleanup and exit routine at line 5(X), to wit: 

200 OFF KBD 

210 IF KBD = 27 THEN 500 

220 ON KBD GOTO 200 

230 RETURN 

500 PRINT GHR$(21);" = " 

510 PRINT CHR$(22):CHR$(14), 

520 TEXT:HOME 

530 nam$ = q$-t "/basic/standard" + q$ 
540 PERFORM getfont 

((a)nam$,(a)array$):PERFORM 

loadfonf((Q)array$) 
550 PRINT CHR$(15), 
560 END 

Well, that's it. When you run this program, 
the little creature's head should appear on the 
left side of the screen, move smoothly to the 
right, and disappear somewhere around the 
thirtieth character position, only to reappear 
again on the left of the screen. One thing is no- 
ticeable, however. If you watch closely, the head 
appears to zip on and off the screen much fast- 
er than it chugs across the main part of the 
screen. This is because the routines at lines 160 
and 185 are much faster than the main routine 
in lines 165 through 180. Although the routine 
can be speeded up somewhat, more drastic 
measures are required to make it substantially 
faster. The tradeoff, as usual, is memory space 
for tables. By prestoring the results of the vari- 
ous string substitutions in a large string array, 
the whole sequence can be rewritten as a simple 
loop. We will declare a string array zoom$ to 
accomplish this, with the following changes to 
the program above: 

10 DIM a%(51 1),ctrllst$(7), 

head 1 $(6),head2$(6),zoom$(23 1 ) 



160 FOR i= 1 TO 231:PERFORM 

control(%17,(a)zoom$(i))name$: 

NEXT 
165 GOTO 160 
940 FOR z= 1 TO 7:zoom$(z) = 

ctrb$(z):NEXT 
945 FOR x=0 TO 30:FOR i = 1 

TO 7 

950 SUB$(ctrlist$(i),2,1) = 

CHR$(x):SUB$(ctrlist$(i), 
11,1) = CHR$(x+1) 

955 zoom$(7'(x+ 1) + i) = 
ctrlist$(i) 

960 NEXT:NEXT 

965 FOR z=225 TO 231:zoom$(z) = 
Ctre$(z-224):NEXT 

970 RETURN 

Notice that we have added code in lines 940 
through 970 to put the various string values into 
the zoomS array, so line 160 now performs the 
entire sequence much faster than before (you 
can now delete lines 170 through 190). The dif- 
ference in speed should be really noticeable. 

The uses of this basic idea are practically un- 
limited. For example, by splitting up the string 
and printing it in various places on-screen, you 
can cause the head to move around, disappear 
from one spot, and reappear somewhere else.

translating them to dots (pixels) on the display 
screen. As a reminder, let's look at the program 
we concluded with last time, which gives a hint 
as to an important capability of the Apple III 
graphics driver, the setting of priorities in the 
color table. Remember that all communication 
to and from the actual bit map is via the .grafix 
driver, and the Bgraf.inv routine is used to 
make the functions of the driver easier to per- 
form. The Bgraf procedure setctab is used to 
change single color entries in the table in a 
much easier manner than the .grafix driver per- 
mits directly. Type in the following program, 
and we'll begin our exploration: 

10 INVOKE'Vbasic/bgraf.inv"

Setting Your Priorities. In the little demon- 
stration of color priorities above, we set the pri- 
mary colors to be 4 and 13 — the fillcolor and 
pencolor respectively — in lines 35 and 40, and 
fill the screen with color 4 (dark green). The 
color-table definition in line 45 says that any 
time color 4 or color 1 3 is printed over color 9, 
the result will remain color 9. Lines 50 through 
65 use the window capability to set up two 
orange (color 9) borders. Without the changes 
to the default color table, anything printed in 
the first or last column of the screen would de- 
stroy the borders. A fairly complete description 
of this process can be found in the device drivers 
manual and in the Business Basic manual (vol- 
ume 2), but running the program is the best way 
to see how this works. The loop in lines 80 
through 90 makes the print string run back- 
ward, one pixel position at a time. As the string 
runs off the left side of the screen, the priority 
established in the color table ensures that 
neither the fill nor pen color will disturb the 
color 9 bars at the edge of the screen. 

This very powerful feature of the Apple III 
graphics driver is exploited very little by pro- 
grammers but will be the subject of much of the 
rest of this article. One comment is important 
before we proceed, however. If you don't have a 
color monitor, there is no need for despair. The 
Apple III automatically translates color output 
into sixteen shades of gray (or green) on your 



MAY 1983 



monochrome display, and the color values in 
the following examples were arrived at to make 
sure they would look okay without color. So, 
get a good grip on your Bgraf.inv module, 
'cause here we go! 

Becoming a Fan of Hi-res Graphics. The 
next program illustrates the abilities of the 
color-priority table on a much grander scale, 
and even suggests how the capability can be 
used to give the illusion of depth to an image on 
the screen. As explained in the Basic manual 
section on Setctab, every pixel to be plotted on- 
screen is first passed through the color table, 
and converted, if necessary, before being actual- 
ly drawn. The word priority is somewhat of a 
misnomer, actually, since the entries in the table 
can produce any color as a result of plotting one 
color over another. It's just as easy to specify 
that plotting dark green over orange will pro- 
duce white as to say that orange will be unaf- 
fected. In addition, the defauh is what you 
would expect; that is, the color you plot with is 
the color you get on-screen. 

Without further ado, let's look at the 
program: 

50 REM 7, 11, and 14 are best background 

colors 
100 0PEN#1, ".grafix" 
110 INVOKE"/basic/bgraf.inv" 
120 black%=0:blue% = 6:orange%=9: 

green% = 1 2:white% = 1 5 
130 dgreen% = 4:brown% = 8:gray% = 10: 

yellow%=13 
1 40 vector( 1 ) =dgreen%: vector(2) = brown %: 

vector(3) =gray%:vector(4) =yellow% 
150 PERFORM grafixmode(%3,%1) 
160 PERFORM initgrafix 
170 GOSUB 1000 

The program opens with the usual initiali- 
zation and defines a number of variables as col- 
or constants in lines 120 through 140. Line 150 
sets the graphics mode to three, the 140-by-192 
color screen. This is the unrestricted sixteen-col- 
or mode, which will be used for the rest of this 
article. After initializing the graphics screen, we 
set up the changes to the color table in a rou- 
tine at line 1000: 

1000 PERFORM setctab(%dgreen%, 

%blue%,%blue%) 
1010 PERFORM setctab(%dgreen%, 

%orange%,%orange%) 
1020 PERFORM setctab(%dgreen%, 

%green%,%green%) 
1030 PERFORM setctab(%dgreen%, 

%white%,%whiite%) 
1040 PERFORM setctab(% brown %, 

%orange%,%orange%) 
1050 PERFORM setctab(%brown%, 

%green % , %g reen % ) 
1060 PERFORM setctab(%brown%, 

%wfiite%,%white%) 
1070 PERFORM setctab(%gray%, 

% g ree n % , %g ree n % ) 
1080 PERFORM setctab(%gray%, 

%whiite%,%white%) 
1090 PERFORM setctab(%yellow%, 

%white%,%white%) 
1100 RETURN 

In the case above, we are using the color ta- 
ble to establish priorities for the vector colors to 
be drawn. As you can see, dark green won't af- 
fect anything but the background, since draw- 
ing dark green over blue, orange, green, or 



MAY 1983 



white will have no effect. Brown, however, will 
draw over blue but will lose to orange, green, 
and white. Gray draws over blue and orange 
but has no effect on green and white. Yellow af- 
fects everything but white. These statements are 
easy to understand and could be programmed 
in simple background situations, but imagine 
what it would be like to draw lines or shapes on 
complex backgrounds. Checking every spot on- 
screen to see what color table is abeady there 
would be incredibly time-consuming. Since the 
color table is built into the .grafix driver, using it 
causes the check to be done at assembly-lan- 
guage speeds, without the programmer having 
to worry about it. 

Enough praise for .grafix. To continue: 

200 INPUT"Background color number: ";a$ 
210 a=VAL(a$):IFa$="" OR a<0 OR a>15 
THEN 510 

To see the effect of the color table further, 
the program allows you to set the overall back- 
ground color for the screen. You should choose 
this carefully, since the color table will affect the 
results of certain choices. Colors 7, 11, and 14 
should give good results. 

Next, we'll use the viewport-fillport combi- 
nations to create various color bars on-screen, 
after first turning on the screen and clearing to 
the background color you have just chosen:

viewport(%77,%92,%35, 

fillcolor(%green%): 
fillport 

viewport(%1 10,%120,%20, 

fillcolor(%white%): 
fillport 



Note that normally you would set up the 
sCTeen and then turn on the display — that is, 
move statement 220 to beyond 390. In this case, 
it's worth noticing how the color bars are set up, 
especially if you use different background col- 
ors than those suggested. The lines above can be 
replaced by some data statements and a loop 
for more compactness, since each set of two 
statements is identical except for parameters, 
but this way you get a feel for exactly what's 
going on. Next, we draw vectors over our land- 
scape and observe the color table effects: 

400 PERFORM viewport(%0,%139,%0, 

%192) 
410 FOR i =1 TO 4 
420 FOR j=1 TO 10 
430 horiz=(i-1)*45+r4 
440 PERFORM moveto(%140,%horiz) 
450 PERFORM pencolor(%vector(i)) 



460 PERFORM lineto(%0,%96) 
470 NEXT j 
480 NEXT i 

500 GET a$:IF ASC(a$)<>27 THEN 
TEXT:GOTO 255 

The routine above sets the viewport to the 
whole screen and then uses a double loop to 
draw lines from the point X=0,Y=% (middle 
of the left side of the screen) to various points 
on the right-hand side. The effect is somewhat 
like a fan (or rays projected from a single 
source). Because of the color priorities estab- 
lished, the effect is quite dramatic, since the rays 
appear to go behind some objects and in front 
of others. Pressing escape in line 500 terminates 
the program, like so: 

510 TEXT 

520 PERFORM release:PERFORM release: 

PERFORM release 
530 INVOKE:CLOSE 
540 END 

Running this program with various back- 
ground colors and various settings of the color 
table will allow you to experiment with the 
setctab procedure enough to get to know its ca- 
pabilities. You might try setting different result 
colors, for example, setting some to the back- 
ground color, and observing the effects. 

The Bugs Are Back. Although the pro- 
gram just listed is interesting, even dramatic in 
its own way, you're paying to see the creatures 
from space, right? So let's bring on the bugs! 
Actually, it is useful to look at combining the 
techniques we have already discussed with the 
new capabilities of the bit-mapped graphics 



197 

display. The following program introduces a 
new creature, somewhat larger than his charac- 
ter graphics ancestors, which was originally 
created using the Shape Editor from the Feb- 
ruary issue. We will use this new kind of "bug" 
(which really resembles a squid) to begin our 
discussion of animation on the hi-res screen. 
The next program defines the creature and lets 
us move him around on-screen. We begin with 
the usual declarations: 

5 DIM mshape%(1,15),x%(255),y%(255) 
10 INVOKE'Vbasic/bgraf.inv" 
15 0PEN#1,".grafix" 
20 GOSUB 1000 

Mshape% in line 5 is the array that will con- 
tain the creature's shape definition (in two 
parts). The first part (column) will show the ten- 
tacles extended, with the second column defin- 
ing the tentacles retracted. This allows simple 
animation, along with movement. The x% and 
y% arrays will be covered in a minute. After in- 
voking the Bgraf.inv module, we gosub to line 
1000 for the shape definition, like so:

Lines 1000 through 1020 read the contents 
of the data statements into the mshape% array, 
thereby defining the two versions of our crea- 
ture. Hang on to these data statements; they will 
be used in several other programs later on in 
this article but are really too dull to repeat. Next 
comes the screen setup: 

25 PERFORM initgrafix 

30 PERFORM grafixmode(%3,%1) 

35 PERFORM fillcolor(%4):PERFORM 

pencolor(%13) 
40 PERFORM fillport 
45 PERFORM viewport(%0,% 139,%0, 

%191) 
50 PERFORM grafixon 

The lines above clear the screen to dark 
green and set the pen color to yellow. Note that 
we again use the 140-by-192 color mode. After 
this setup we initialize some general variables: 

55 f% = 4:s% = 16:z% = 0 

60 x%(8) = -3:x%(21) = 3:y%(11) = 

3:y%(10) = -3 
65 i = 70:j = 90 

Of note above is line 60, which establishes 
some entries into the large x% and y% arrays. A 
quick check of your keyboard chart should tell 
you that ASCII 8 is the left arrow key, 21 is the 
right arrow key, 1 1 is the up arrow, and 10 is the 



down arrow. Left and right correspond to 
movement in the X direction, and up and down 
in the Y direction. This makes it obvious that 
we will be using values in the x% and y% arrays 
to indicate the amount and direction of move- 
ment, depending on which cursor key is pressed 
(left and down both being negative move- 
ments). As we have seen before, such tech- 
niques waste space but increase speed. We'll see 
an even more interesting application of this 
technique in just a minute. For now, on with the 
program: 

70 PERFORM moveto(%i,%j) 

75 IF r% = 0 THEN r% = 16:ELSE r% = 0 

80 PERFORM drawimage(@mshape% 

(0,0) , %f % , %r% , %z% , % s% , %s% ) 
85 GET a$:a = ASG(a$) 
90 IF a<>27 THEN i = i+x%(a):j=j+y%(a): 

GOTO 70 

The lines above constitute the main loop of 
the program. After moving to the position es- 
tablished by the initial values of i and j, r% is set 
to alternate between 0 and 1 6, which will be our 
bit index into the mshape% array. The drawim- 
age procedure (from Bgraf.inv) is then used to 
put the appropriate bit pattern on-screen at the 
current pen location. See your Basic manual for 
a specific discussion of drawimage, but funda- 
mentally the parameters look like this: 

PERFORM drawlmage(@array, 

%Num.Row.Bytes,%X.sklp,%Y.skip, 

%Dr.width,%Dr.height) 

This definition parallels, of course, the 
drawblock capability of the .grafix driver and 




allows you to specify a source array, the num- 
ber of bytes in a given row of the array (needed 
to find the offset for row 2 and so on), the num- 
ber of bits to skip in the row before drawing, the 
number of rows to skip in a column before 
drawing, the number of row bits to draw from 
that point, and the number of rows to draw. 
This is sufficient information to define any ar- 
bitrary rectangular block of bits in any given ar- 
ray. Any bits in the array that are on (that is, 1 s) 
are drawn in the current pencolor, and any that 
are off (Os) are dravm in the current fillcolor. 

Lines 85 and 90 get keystrokes and modify 
the values of i and j according to the contents of 
that character location in the x% and y% ar- 
rays, and then jump back to 70 to redisplay the 
creature at the new location. If the character 
typed is an escape (27), then cleanup and termi- 
nation are done: 

100 TEXT 

105 PERFORM releaseiPERFORM release: 

PERFORM release 
110 CLOSE:INVOKE 
115 END 

If you type nothing else in from this article, 
at least try this program. You should have some 
fun watching the creature swim around the 
screen at your command. For a little more ex- 
citement, try adding the following 

61 x%(55) = -3:y%(55) = 3:x%(49) = 
-3:y%(49) = -3 

62 x%(57)=3:y%(57) = 3:x%(51) = 
3:y%(51)=-3 

63 x% (52) = - 3: x% (54) = 3;y % (56) = 
3:y%(50) = -3 

The lines above set up additional defini- 
tions of possible X and Y movements. Close 
examination of your ASCII chart will show that 
the codes correspond to numbers on the nu- 
meric pad of the Apple III. ASCII 55 in line 61 
corresponds to the 7 character, which is in the 
upper left-hand corner of the keypad. Both x% 
and y% are affected, x% being decremented (in- 
dicating movement to the left) and y% being in- 
cremented (indicating movement up). This com- 
bination creates diagonal motion. Quick com- 
parisons with the rest of the characters will 
show the remaining relationships. Add these 
lines and run the program again. You'll find 
that you can control the creature completely 
from the pad! Note also that changing the con- 
stant value will change the amount of move- 
ment in any direction. 

Onward, Ever Diagonally. Here's hoping 
that the program above has whetted your ap- 
petite for more creature features. The next pro- 
gram will combine creature movement with the 
windowing techniques of the graphics driver to 
create interesting motions of several creatures at 
once. First, however, some fooling around 
should be encouraged. Try changing the dis- 
placement constants in the previous program to 
values higher than three. For example, try: 

60 x%(8)=5:x%(21) = -5:y%(11) = 
5:y%(10) = -5 

Now use the cursor keys. Makes a mess, 
right? Right. What happens is that while the 
previous drawblock image had enough fillcolor 
bits (zero-value bits) surrounding the image to 
blank out any movement of three pixels in any 



MAY 1983 



direction, when we move five at a time, some 
old bits are left on-screen without being cleaned 
up by the next occurrence of drawimage. A 
quick glance at the data statements will show 
that only three rows on top and three on the 
bottom are completely zero. Some analysis of 
the row values will prove that the same is true 
about zero bits on the left and right sides of the 
columns. To allow our next program some free- 
dom as to how much displacement an image 
can have without leaving trash on the screen, we 
will do the following 

10 DIM mshape%(1,15),zshape%(1,31) 

15 INVOKE'Vbasic/bgraf.inv" 

20 0PEN#1,".grafix" 

25 GOSUB 1000 

The difference in this program is that we in- 
troduce the zshape% array with twice as many 
rows as our mshape% array. This array is ini- 
tialized in the routine at 1000, as follows: 

1000 RESTORE 

1010 FOR j = 0 TO 15:F0R i = 0 TO 

1:READ mshape%{i,j):NEXT:NEXT 

1020 FOR j = 0 TO 15:F0R i = 0 TO 
1:zshape%(i,j+8)=mshape%(i,j): 
NEXT: NEXT 

1030 RETURN 

Please note that we use the same data state- 
ments from the last program, and, once the 
mshape% array is defined, we load the middle 
of the zshape% array with it. The offset in the 
rows between mshape% and zshape% gives 
eight extra blank rows at the top and bottom of 
zshape%, enough for the tricks we are about to 
pull. 



Next, we initialize and declare a viewport, in 
which the visible part of our operations will 
occur: 

35 PERFORM initgrafix 
40 PERFORM grafixmode(%3,%1) 
45 PERFORM pencolor(%4) 
50 PERFORM fillcolor(%7): PERFORM fillporl 
55 PERFORM viewport(%40,%100,%15, 
%130) 

60 PERFORM fillcolor(%13):PERFORM 
fillport 

65 PERFORM grafixon 

Note above that, although the graphics rou- 
tines will let us draw anywhere on the screen 
(and anywhere off the screen from —32768 to 
32767), the only visible effects will occur in the 
40,130 to 100,15 window. Next, we get to the 
more elaborate draw section: 

1 00 s% = 16:t% = 32:z% = 0:f% = 4 

105 FOR k=0 TO 100 

110 j = COS(k/5 + 2)*53+88 

115 l=SIN(k/10)*30+58 

120 m = SIN(k/10)*70 + 85 

125 r%=s%*(r%=z%) 

130 PERFORM moveto(%k+ 28,%j) 

135 PERFORM drawimage(@zshape%(0, 

0), %f % , %r% ,%z% , %s%, %t% ) 
140 PERFORM moveto(%k+ 14, %l) 
145 PERFORM drawimage(@mshape%(0, 

0 ) , % f % , % r % , % z % , % s % , % s % ) 
150 PERFORM moveto(%k,%m) 
155 PERFORM drawimage(@zshape%(0, 

0),%f%,%r%,%z%,%s%,%t%) 
160 NEXT k 

200 GET a$:IF ASC(a$) <> 27 THEN 105 
The effect of the statements in lines 110 
through 120 is to create different Y values for 
each of three creature images. Lines 130 



199 

through 155 then move to each unique loca- 
tion, draw the appropriate creature image, and 
go on. Note that the incremental movement of 
the first and third shapes is great enough that 
we need to use the zshape% version. Since 
zshape% takes longer to draw, mshape% is used 
where possible. Note also that the X positions 
are offset for each other, with the boundaries of 
the window responsible for clipping the images 
until they are within the display area. Running 
this program will produce images of bouncing 
creatures zipping through a boxlike window on 
the screen. 

Like most programs, this one has a cleanup 
section: 

300 PERFORM release:PERFORM 

release: PERFORM release 
310 CLOSE:INVOKE 
320 TEXT 
330 END 

There, have fun with that one! 

By the way, if you want to edit your own 
creatures for the previous program, or for any 
to follow, you can use the February Shape Edi- 
tor and make the following changes to the pro-

The routine from lines 1000 through 1090 
can be used as a general-purpose shape-load 
routine. Note the addition of the Request.inv 
invokable to do the reading of the shape file. 

Wrapping It All Up and Bouncing It off si 
Wall. The previous program proves that you 
can get the shapes to move through some rath- 
er elaborate paths. The next program puts to- 
gether everything we have covered so far and 
borrows from an idea in the old Applesoft Tu- 
torial manual — that of objects (the book called 
the little square blocks "balls") bouncing off the 
walls of a video room, not unlike the old Pong 
game. Since we have already shown how to en- 
dow our creations with X and Y movements, 
this should be easy: 

10 DIM mshape%(1,l5) 



MAY 1983 



15 INVOKE'Vbasic/bgraf.inv" 
20 0PEN#1,".grafix" 
25 GOSUB 1000 

The preceding lines comprise the usual 
warm-up. The routine at line 1000 is the usual 
and employs the data statements from the pre- 
vious programs, to wit: 

1000 RESTORE 

1010 FOR 1 = 0 TO 15:F0R j=0 TO 1:READ 

mshape%(j,i):NEXT:NEXT 
1020 RETURN 

Now on to setting up the screen: 

30 PERFORM initgrafix

65 PERFORM fillcolor(%4):PERFORM

70 GOSUB 600:REM set color table 
After clearing the screen to gray in line 40, 
we print the title "Bug Box" above a window of 
yellow created by lines 50 and 55. Then a dark 
green square is drawn in the middle of the box 
by lines 60 and 65, and we go to the routine at 
line 600 to set up our color-table scheme: 

600 PERFORM setctab(%7,%2,%7) 
610 PERFORM setctab{%2,%7,%7) 
620 PERFORM setctab(%14,%2,%13) 
630 PERFORM setctab(%15,%7,%13)

665 PERFORM setctab(%7,%4,%4) 
670 PERFORM setctab(%14,%4,%4) 
675 PERFORM setctab(%15,%4,%4) 
690 RETURN 

As the routine above might tend to indi- 
cate, we will employ two creatures in this dem- 
onstration, one dark blue (color 2) and one light 
blue (7). The dark blue creature will use a fill- 
color of aqua (14) and the light blue one will use 
a fillcolor of white (15). As you can see from 
lines 600 and 610, the dark blue creature will al- 
ways appear to pass behind (be covered up by) 
the light blue creature, should their paths cross. 
Lines 620 through 655 ensure that the back- 
ground (fill) colors will always translate to yel- 
low (13), the background color of the box in 
which our creatures will live (and bounce). 
Study this carefully, until you are sure as to 
what is going on. Finally, lines 660 through 675 
ensure diat any movement in the area of the 
dark green (4) box will be hidden — that is, ap- 
pear to go behind that object, since all colors 
drawn onto color 4 will result in color 4 on the 
screen. 

Now that our colors are set, on with the 
show.

The lines above add the X and Y incre- 
ments (or decrements, if n^ative) to their re- 
spective values and check to see if the results are 
within the ranges of the window. Note that the 
pen position is always the upper left-hand cor- 
ner of the drawblock image, which explains the 
differences in the values from the viewport 
statement above. Now we get into the actual 
draw routines, based on the positions calcu- 
lated above: 

145 r%=s%*(r%=z%) 

150 PERFORM moveto(%x1n,%y1n) 

155 PERFORM pencolor(%2):PERFORM

200 Slx = x1n:s1y=y1n:s2x=x2n:s2y=y2n 
205 GOTO 125 

Notice again that we use r% to calculate the 
offset into the mshape% array to animate our 
creature. Lines 150 through 160 move to the cal- 
culated position of our first creature, set the col- 
ors, and draw the image. Lines 165 through 175 
do the same for the second creature. Now 
comes something interesting. Creature number 
two has priority over creature number one, if 
they are in the same space. Therefore drawing 
over number one will destroy part of its image, 
which subsequent repositioning of the crea- 
tures cannot re-create. Lines 180 through 195 
check for this possibility and redraw creature 
number one to fill in any missing parts before 
the next erase at the top of the loop. Try the 
program without these lines to see what hap- 
pens. In either circumstance, line 200 sets the 
current positions of the creatures to the posi- 
tions just used and starts over. The effect is that 



of the two beasts bouncing off the four walls in 
quite a regular fashion. Changing the values of 
xlm, x2m, ylm, and y2m will affect the type, 
length, and angle of bounce. Experiment and 
see what you like (random numbers are fun, 
too.) 

A little more and we're finished

255 IF KBD = 27 THEN 300 

260 IF KBD=13 THEN POP:GOTO 40 

265 ON KBD GOTO 250 

270 RETURN 

This on kbd routine allows termination 
(with escape (27)); if return is pressed, the pro- 
gram starts over with new random locations for 
the creatures. This is useful if you want to see 
how the color table affects the creatures when 



they cross over, but the random values put them 
on paths that don't cross. You just press return 
and start over with a new scenario.

JLee McFadden makes 
learning to use your 
computer and its programs 
an easy, rewarding 
experience. 

Mastering a new system or even a new 
program is not easy. It takes a lot of study, a 
lot of trial and en'or, a lot of back-and-forth 
between dense manuals and your computer. 
Wouldn't it all be so much easier if you had 
a knowledgeable friend sitting by your side? 

Lee McFadden is that friend. He's been 
producing widely acclaimed teaching tapes 
for over ten years. He knows what infonna- 
tion you need, and exactly when you need 
it. Team his skill with the know-how of 
technical experts, and you get a faster, 
easier way to master your computer and all 
its power. 

Patented Audio Cassettes 

Lee guides you patiently, step-by-step, while 
you're sitting at your keyboard. No con- 
nection between the computer and your 
cassette player is necessary. You learn by 
doing, instead of by reading. And even the 
tapes are special— a patented RipTrack

The main function of a computer's operating system is to get your 
programs and data into the computer and get the results back out to you. 
In computer jargon we're talking about input/output or I/O functions. 

Let's look at Apple DOS as an operating system. We'll see why it 
is friendly to us common folks. You'U find out what those two noble 
DOS commands pr# and in# really do and how they do it. You'll also 
discover what's so special about control-D and why it doesn't seem to 
work properly sometimes. And you'll get an overview of a special part of 
the Apple II's memory, complete with maps. 

About a Small Conspiracy. Operating systems are usually written in 
assembly language. They provide a computer with very elementary in- 
structions for dealing with the outside world (you). Most operating sys- 
tems were written for people who have sand (er, silicon) for brains. 

CP/M, for example, the most widely used microcomputer operating 
system after Apple DOS, seems to have been written to make small com- 
puters as difficult to use as large ones. There are those who say the real 
meaning of CP/M is Conspiracy to Protect the Ministry. If that's true, it 
doesn't seem to be working — the power and influence of the computer 
priesthood is clearly dwindling. 

The microprocessor in a computer like the Apple communicates with 
the outside world by looking at certain special memory locations de- 
signed to be built into the computer. In the Apple II, for example, byte 
number 49152 is the primary memory location for dealing with the 
Apple's keyboard. This byte is usually called KBD. You can create your 
own little minioperating system by means of the following program: 

10 KBD = PEEK (49152) 

20 IF KBD < 128 THEN 10 

30 POKE 49168,0 

40 PRINT KBD 

50 IF KBD < > 155 THEN 10 

60 END 

How It Works. If the value at KBD is equal to or greater than 128, 
that means a key has been pressed. And until a key is pressed, this 
program is locked in a loop at lines 10 and 20. (We'll talk about line 30 in 
a moment.) 

Line 40 prints the value we found. Line 50 tests to see if the key we 
pressed was the escape key (this key returns the value 155). If not, we 
continue the program; else we END. 

When you run this program, nothing happens until you press a key. 
The value associated with that key then appears on-screen. Try typing in 
the ABCs. If the program works, go to the next paragraph. {Global 
Program Line Editor, and probably some other programs as well, plays 
tricks with KBD, so run the program without GPLE.) 

Line 30 pokes a value into another special memory location, usually 
called ih^keyboard strobe or KBDSTRB. A reference to this location (it 
can be a peek or a poke; if a poke, it doesn't matter what value you poke 



there) resets KBD so that it's below 128 (referencing this location 
actually subtracts 128 from the value at KBD). 

If you drop line 30 from the program you'll find that all the keys on 
your computer (except for escape) repeat automatically, whether you 
want them to or not. If you put the poke in line 30 before the test in line 
20, your keyboard will operate somewhat erratically. 

Switch Softly. The purpose of all this is to show you how a micro- 
computer deals with a simple device, such as a built-in keyboard, by 
peeking and poking at its own memory locations. The locations a com- 
puter uses in this manner are called soft switches, so named because they 
are electronic switches you can control with software. 

Different computers use different memory locations for these soft 
switches. Thus you cannot use the Apple's ojjerating system on an Atari 
computer, even though both use the same microprocessor known as the 
6502. Part of the explanation for this is the fact that these two comput- 
ers use different areas of memory for their soft switches. 

The Apple II comes with a built-in operating system. Apple DOS is 
an extension of that built-in system, known as the Apple Monitor. The 
Monitor lives at the very highest addresses in your Apple's memory, 
from 63488 (in hexadecimal that's $F800) to 65535 (SFFFF). 

The Monitor includes programs that sense when you touch your key- 
board and that display characters on your screen. It also contains soft- 
ware routines for dealing with the built-in speaker, game controllers, and 
a cassette tape recorder. 

The Monitor doesn't include any routines to operate devices con- 
nected through your Apple's slots, such as a printer or a modem (a de- 
vice that connects your computer to a phone line). And it doesn't in- 
clude much that relates to DOS. But the way the Monitor provides for 
these items is extremely clever and is responsible in large part for the Ap- 
ple's friendliness. 

Programs Written in Sand. The Monitor's cleverness is closely re- 
lated to the design of a very special 4,096-byte area of Apple memory, 
from location 49152 (SCOOO) to location 53247 (SCFFF). The first 256 
bytes of this area contain the soft switches (the keyboard locations we 
just used are at SCOOO and SCO 10). The remaining 3,840 bytes hold as- 
sembly language programs that extend the Apple's operating system. 

What is clever is that these programs are actually contained on your 
peripheral cards. Each card comes complete with its own operating sys- 
tem. Since the programs on these cards are permanently stored there, 
you needn't worry about loading special programs in from a disk or con- 
cern yourself with the technical aspects of interfacing your Apple with 
outside devices — everything required is included right on the card itself. 

Adding a new peripheral (or removing one) always involves repro- 
gramming the operating system. The Apple II is one of the few comput- 
ers you can reprogram with the power off. You simply push a card in a 
slot or remove it from a slot. 

Draw Me a Map. The accompanying figure will give you a better 
idea of how things are organized inside your Apple's memory. The left- 



206 



MAY 1983 



most bar of the figure represents the addresses in your Apple's memory, 
with the lowest addresses at the top of the bar and the highest at the bot- 
tom. Some of you may think the map is upside down; if you use the 
Monitor's memory dump much, however, you'll soon realize that it's 
correctly presented and that everyone else is out of step. 

The center bar of the figure is a magnification of the part of the Apple 
memory dedicated to input and output. The center bar shows one-six- 
teenth of your Apple's memory addresses. 

The rightmost bar is a further magnification of the first 256 bytes of 
the input/output area. It represents l/256th of your Apple's memory. 
This area is where all the soft switches live. 

Because the numbers are round and make a great deal more sense in 
hexadecimal, the map presents them that way. If you've never under- 
stood hexadecimal numbers, try it now. They are just like decimal num- 
bers, except that each digit can range from 0 to 15 instead of 0 to 9. To 
represent the digits from 10 to 15, hexadecimal notation uses the letters A 
through F. Any number you see that begins with a $ is a hexadecimal 
number. 

Let's start with the rightmost bar. Again, this bar represents the 256- 
byte memory area, from 49152 ($C000) to 49407 ($COFF). All of your 
Apple's soft switches are in this area. The map shows that half of the 
soft-switch addresses are dedicated to built-in devices, such as the screen 
display, speaker, and game controllers; the other half are associated with 
your Apple's slots. 

Look What They Did to the He. In the Apple II and II Plus, just 30 
of the 128 addresses available for built-in soft switches were actually 
used. In the Apple He, the number of available addresses was nearly dou- 
bled, to 58. There are still many addresses left for built-ins in the He Plus. 

Some of the new soft switches in the He control new features — a 
built-in alternate character set (the alternate set has inverse lower-case 
letters instead of flashing capitals) and provision for eighty-column dis- 
play and 64K auxiliary memory. Other new switches give you the ability 
to find out how other switches are set. For example, in older Apples

there's no way to tell from inside a program whether the screen is set to 
text or graphic display. On the I le, activating one of the soft switches will 
tell you this. 

Last month, in our discussion of the He DOS changes, we men- 
tioned that two of these new soft switches are poked whenever DOS is 
booted. According to the new (thirty-dollar!) reference manual, one of 
them turns off the alternate character set and the other turns off eighty- 
column display. 

The lowCT half of the rightmost bar in the figure shows the addresses of 
the soft switches associated with your Apple's slots. Each slot gets six- 
teen addresses to use for soft switches. Some peripheral cards use just a 
few of them, but your disk controller card, for example, uses all sixteen. 

A language card, which expands the amount of memory available in 
your computer by 16K and slips into slot 0, uses eight of the sixteen lo- 
cations in the $C080 to $C08F area to control its various functions. (The 
Apple He has no slot 0— $C080 to $C08F in a He controls its language 
card memory, which is built in.) 

On the other hand, your printer, if it's plugged into slot 1, receives 
characters and is controlled with soft switches in the $C090 to 
$C09F area. 

Extending the Monitor, The middle bar of the figure shows that these 
soft switches take up only one-sixteenth of the memory addresses in the 
input/output area. The rest of the addresses are used for the assembly 
language programs that extend your Apple's operating system. These are 
the programs built into your peripheral cards. 

The programs on the cards, which tell your Apple how to use the six- 
teen soft switches associated with each card, start at memory location 
49408 (SClOO). 

The 256 bytes at and following $C 100 are owned by whatever card is 
in slot 1 . The card in slot 2 gets everything from $C200 to $C2FF, and so 
on. Each slot has a dedicated 256-byte space, except slot 0. 

In addition to the seven 256-byte program areas, there is a 2,048-byte 
space, from 51200 ($C800) to 53247 (SCFFF), that any card can use for 
expanded assembly language routines. This space is as large as the entire 
Monitor itself. While only one card can use this area at a time, it is easy 
for any card to grab control of the area and use it as needed. (The Apple

He uses this area too. This is where it hides the programs that handle 
eighty-(X)lumn display. The He's self-diagnostic program is hidden in the 
address areas for the individual slots.) 

The leftmost bar of the figure shows you how this input /output area 
fits into the whole Apple address scheme. 

Never Golf at I/O Links. Near the top of this bar, in a memory area 
known as the zero page (bytes 0 [$00] to 256 [$FF]), there are two loca- 
tions essential to the Apple operating system. They're known as the I/O 
links. One of these locations, Outlink, always contains the address of the 
current output routine; the other, Inlink, contains the current input 
routine. 

Whenever a character is to be sent to the screen, the printer, or any 
other device, the character is stored inside the microprocessor itself, and 
control of the computer is passed to the subroutine Outlink points to. 

If the character is supposed to go to a modem in slot 2, for example, 
Outlink will point to a routine in the area from $C200 to $C2FF. This 
routine will take the character and send it down your phone line using its 
own special magic. Then the routine will either pass control back to 
where it came from or jump to a routine in the Monitor that will put the 
character on your screen. 

You control what is in Outlink and Inlink with the pr# and in# com- 
mands. A pr#6, for example, stores the address of the program space for 
slot 6 ($C600) in Outlink. The next time a character is sent out — usual- 
ly it's the return at the end of the command — the call to Outlink will pass 
control of the computer to the card in slot 6. 

More Noises. If the card there controls a printer, you'll hear the 
printer react to the return character by moving over to start a new line. 
But we all know that slot 6 is where you have your disk controller card. 
And we all know that pr#6 doesn't send anything to your disk drive. 

The routines stored on your disk controller card tell your Apple how 
to boot a disk. We talked about booting last month. When you turn your 
computer over to your disk controller with a pr#6 (or whatever), it loads 
Apple DOS, an extension of your Apple's built-in operating system, into 
memory. 



You might wonder why DOS is stored on the disk and loaded into 
valuable memory you could use, when it could be on the disk controller 
card itself. Why doesn't DOS use the program space at $C800? There are 
several reasons that DOS isn't permanently etched there. The biggest is 
that DOS is about 10,750 bytes long and only 2,048 bytes are available at 
SCSOO. 

Once DOS is loaded into memory, it "cold-starts" itself. One of the 
many things that happen during the cold start is that DOS stores the ad- 
dresses of a couple of its own routines in Outlink and Inlink. 

Outlink is located at bytes 54 and 55 ($36 and $37); Inlink is at 56 and 
57 ($38 and $39). 

In assembly language, addresses are stored backward in two con- 
secutive bytes. To find the address of the current Output routine you 
would type: 

PRINT PEEK(55)*256 + PEEK(54) 

This tells you, in decimal, the two-byte value stored in Outlink. If 
you use 57 and 56 with your peeks, you'll get the address at Inlink. 

If you do this now, you'll most likely find 40637 ($9EBD) at Outlink 
and 40577 ($9E81) at Inlink. These are the addresses of the DOS output 
and input routines. 

If you have a printer, turn it on with a pr#whatever. Now look at 
Outlink again. The Outlink value will somehow appear on your printer, 
but the number still points to DOS. This effect has puzzled nearly every- 
one who has tried to determine how these links work. 

The Captain Returns. If you read the article "DOS Be Nimble, DOS 
Be Quick" back in March, you might remember discovering that one of 
the main programs inside DOS, affectionately known as the Captain, is 
part spy: "This guy actually reroutes all your incoming and outgoing 
keystrokes and messages; so he gets to see them first. If he detects some- 
thing that looks like it's for him, he tries to act on it." 

So what does the Captain really do when he sees your pr# or in# 
command? Well, he does in fact change the address stored at Out-

Buying a copy of Roger Wagner's Assembly Lines: The Book means never having to 
say you're sorry. 

Your programming friends will be pea green mth envy. They'll scratch their heads 
and ponder the beauty of your self-modifying code and indirect jumps. They'll beg to 
hear more about I/O routines, the stack, and sound generation. 

In short, you can lord it over your local programming enclave as long as someone 
else doesn't buy Wagner's book. Then you'll be in trouble. 

But at least you'll have a head start. You'll already have mastered branch offsets and 
reverse branches. Reading a game paddle, comparing commands, and carrying the flag 
will already be under your belt.

order direct from Softalk. Assembly Lines: The Book is also available in many fine 
computer stores around the country. 

If you are attending the Boston Applefest May 13-15, please stop by the Softalk

link for a microsecond or two but then immediately replaces it with his 
own address. He still wants to see all your mail. 

So that he can trick you into thinking you are really in control of 
your own destiny, the Captain does take note of the address in Outlink 
before he replaces it with his own. He stores the true Outlink at loca- 
tions 43603 and 43604 ($AA53 and $AA54) and the true Inlink at 43605 
and 43606 ($AA55 and $AA56). 

If your printer is still on, type: 

PRINT PEEK{43604)*256 + PEEK(43603) 

If your printer is in slot 1, you will get an answer somewhere between 
49410 (SClOO) and 49663 (SCIFF). The answer usually is not right at 
SCI 00, where you would probably expect it to be. This is because most 
peripheral cards start with an initialization routine that determines which 
slot the card is in and sets up some variables for the routines on the card. 
As part of the initialization, the card will change the address in Outlink 
to point to its true output routine. 

A Detailed Look at How It All Works. By now you may be starting 
to appreciate how cleverly this Outlink/ Inlink system really works. Let's 
try another short program. It's very similar to the one we started with, 
but it uses the Apple's operating system instead of creating a miniop- 
e rating system. 

10 GET A$ 
20 PRINT A$; 

30 IF A$<>CHR${27) THEN 10 
40 END 

When you run this program, this is what happens: 
* Basic sees your get command and calls on Inlink, which points 
to the DOS input routine. . . . 

* The DOS input routine immediately changes the link 
addresses to their true values. 

* It then checks for several special conditions. 

* Since none are true, the DOS input routine calls on Inlink, 



which now points to the Monitor input routine. . . . 
* The Monitor input routine puts a flashing cursor on your 
screen and starts watching KBD. 

* Much of your Apple's life is spent right here, waiting for 
someone to press a key. 

* You press X. 

* The cursor is removed from the screen. 

* The Monitor routine stores your X in the microprocessor 
and returns to . . . 

* the DOS input routine, which replaces the addresses in the 
I/O links with its own and returns to . . . 

* Basic, which stores your X in the variable A$ and goes on to 
your next command, 

* PRINT A$;, which gets your X from A$, puts it in the 
microprocessor, and calls on Outlink, which points to the DOS 
output routine. . . . 

* Like its kinsman, the DOS output routine immediately 
changes the link addresses to their true values. 

* It next looks carefully at the character stored in the 
microprocessor and checks for several special conditions, 
none of which turns out to be true. 

* It calls on Outlink, which now points to the Monitor's output 
routine. . . . 

* The Monitor puts the X on your screen, right where the 
cursor was, 

* and advances the "cursor position" (going to a new line 
and scrolling the screen if necessary), and returns to . . . 

* the DOS output routine, which replaces the addresses in the 
I /O links with its own, and returns to . . . 

* Basic, which checks to see if there's an escape character in A$. 
(Note that the CHR$ code Applesoft wants for escape, 27, is 
exactly 128 less than the code we used before, 155.) 

* Since A$ holds an X, not escape, the whole process begins again. 
It's very hard to believe that all of this really happens in the split sec- 
ond after you press a key. Sit and watch it. 

The important part happens when the Captain takes a look at the 
character in the microprocessor on the Outlink call. He ignores almost 
everything. But whenever he sees a return he lifts his head until the next 
character passes by. If that next character is a control-D, the Captain sits 
straight up and starts paying close attention; if it's not, he goes back to 
ignoring everything. 

Take Two Control-D s and Call Me in the Morning. Whenever 
you're writing a program and you include a DOS command that doesn't 
seem to be executed (but appears on your screen instead), the problem is 
that you aren't sending the control-D or aren't sending it immediately af- 
ter a return. If the last print statement before the DOS command ended 
with a return-suppressing semicolon, your control-D will not be the first 
character after a return. The Captain will ignore it. 

The surest cure for this was published here last June — it bears re- 
peating. Use: 

D$=CHR$(13)+CHR$(4) 

CHR$(13) is the code for return, just as CHR$(4) is the code for con- 
trol-D. (You should be careful when you close text files with this, how- 
ever. It could give you an extra return you don't want at the end of 
your file.) 

The control-D technique allows plain old Applesoft and Integer Ba- 
sic to use DOS quite easily, and in exactly the same way. With some op- 
erating systems you have to use an "extended" version of Basic if you 
have a disk drive. With others, you get to learn a new set of disk com- 
mands every time you turn around. In some situations, even the com- 
mands you type on the keyboard can be different, depending on wheth- 
er you are using the operating system directly or from within Basic. 

With friendly old Apple DOS we don't need a "disk" Basic, and we 
have to learn just one set of DOS commands. Some of the computer 
priests you meet will tell you that the way Apple DOS hangs from the 
I/O links is a "fundamental design error" (or worse). In fact, it is quite 
simple, elegant, and friendly. No wonder Apple DOS is the most widely 
used disk operating system in the world.

VisiCalc's many features and functions are obvious; they're listed in 
the manual. Nevertheless, discovering how to use these capabilities to ad- 
vantage is not always easy to do. This month, we'll continue to look at 
more effective methods of template design; our particular focus will be 
on templates to be used in forecasting. 

The secret to the success of a forecasting template, as well as to the ef- 
fectiveness of many other types of templates, is in the design. In a fore- 
casting template especially, it's important that you set things up so that 
variables can be changed to reflect different assumptions. 

Template Design. It can be helpful to think of a template as consist- 
ing of seven different areas. The first of these is the report area, which 
contains the printed and/or visual part of your model. The second is the 
calculation area. Not all templates require a separate calculation section 
(sometimes, calculations are handled in the report section), but in tem- 
plates that involve many rows or columns of calculations, it's best to set 
one up. The third section is where variables are put. In many models, it 
works fine to include variables in the report section, but just as often it's 
better to have a separate variable section in which all variables can be 
seen and changed as needed. Having this consolidated variable section 
eliminates the need to search through the template every time you need 
to locate a variable. 

The fourth area is the data area. This section may contain either the 
numeric data necessary for the model or consolidation data from 
another template. The fifth area is where graphic representations of data 
(using /F*) are stored. The sixth area is the antirecursive section, which is 
intended to eliminate the requirement to do multiple recalculations to 
achieve accuracy. Lastly, section seven is where check calculations to val- 
idate the report are done. Though few templates will use all seven differ- 
ent sections, almost every complex one will use two or more of them. 

Forecasting — Scientific Guessing or Crystal Ball Magic? For some 
people, forecasting is natural. For most, though, forecasting is an art, 
and a black art at that. You might as well use a random number genera- 
tor or draw numbers out of a hat. But there is hope. Look at any prod- 
uct and you can determine many variables that will affect its sales. In 
fact, if you think long enough, you'll probably find so many variables 
that the whole issue of forecasting will become even more confusing. The 
secret to good forecasting is to eliminate the inconsequential variables 
and concentrate on the important ones. 

In order to forecast accurately, it's important not to rely on any sin- 
gle set of assumptions for your forecast. If you can do a second or even 
multiple forecasts based on different criteria, with reasonably similar re- 
sults, then you can feel comfortable about the accuracy of your 
predictions. 

If you want to forecast the sales for a particular product, the best 
place to b^n is by looking at comparable or competing products. De- 
pending on the maturity of the product, these may be a very helpful 
beginning reference. Another option is to look at your channel of distribu- 
tion, the chain of people and organizations that buy the product before it 
reaches the final purchaser. Estimating what your potential sales are 
through this channel can give you an idea of what kind of total sales to 
expect overall. A third method would be to look at the potential pur- 
chasers of your product, both new purchasers and current owners of 
similar products that might "trade up" to yours. If the market is new or 
rapidly expanding, there probably won't be much history or other infor- 
mation on which to base your sales estimate. Then, as always, even your 



SHELTOH 

intuition can be an important variable. 

Before proceeding, let's define and simplify our forecasting template. 
Let's say that we are forecasting sales of a personal computer and a num- 
ber of accessory software applications for that product. Our forecast will 
determine the estimated computer sales based on a number of variables 
and software sales based on a percentage of computer system sales. 

Let's further define the situation. You are the sales manager for the 
XX/Z Super Micro Computer and are responsible for providing the 
manufacturing department with a sales forecast. Manufacturing re- 
quires a one-year rolling forecast. You announced the XX/Z computer 
six months ago and have already sold 65,000 units. Two other compa- 
nies are selling similar computers (the VI and the FUBAR), but nobody 
offers one with the features the XX/Z has. You have an estimated sales 
forecast for the VI, but the FUBAR is so new that forecasting is 
impossible. 

You also have the responsibility for forecasting sales of three new 
and unannounced software products. You have access to sales histories 
of similar products on similar computers and you know that the sales of 
each application average out to a known percentage of computer system 
sales. Since these software products are about to be announced, you'll 
also have to account for some additional sales in the first few months to 
the installed base of computer owners. 

What's the Forecast? There are two obvious ways to approach this 
forecasting task. The first is to estimate how many people in the installed 
base of computer owners will buy your computer and add to that your 
estimate of how many new computer owners will choose to buy your 
computer. Your second, or backup, forecast might be the unit sales for 
each of your sales outlets (retail stores, for example). If the two forecasts 
are close, you're home free; if they aren't, you must decide what to make 
of the discrepancies. And that can be a problem, so don't expect an an- 
swer here. 

One more comment. This column usually emphasizes how impor- 
tant it is to keep your template simple. This template won't be particu- 
larly simple. We're going to experiment, and in the process we'll likely 
learn as much about VisiCalc as we do about forecasting. 

Boot VisiCalc and let's begin. The first thing to think about is how 
we should set up the template. 

We'll plan this template to have report, variable, and computational 
(work) sections so you can see how to lay it out. In designing your own 
template, if s a good idea to put your variables at the top, provided that 
you know all the variables required. You should also put the computa- 
tion section at the top of the model; that way, the template won't require 
a second recalculation before the report "sees" the new variables or cal- 
culated values. 

Usually, you know what you want the report section to look like, so 
you complete that section before starting anything else. So let's begin 
with the report section. Enter the information shown in figure 1 . You'll 
notice that we've started a few rows from the top of the worksheet. We'll 
fill in the variable and calculation sections above that later. 

Don't worry about the blank rows; we'll come back and fill them in. If 
you'd wanted to, you could have entered all of the information in col- 
umns A and B in sequential rows and then inserted additional rows as 
you needed them. 

The LB. in cell B20 stands for "installed base." Rows 29 through 31 
will contain the forecasts for the applications software products.

Figure 1. 



The next thing we want to do is to set up the initial variables. Enter 
the variables' titles and values as shown in figure 2 and we'll discuss them 
later. 

A cursory explanation of each variable is in order. The 60,000 in C6 re- 
fers to the installed user base of the older version XX/Z computer that 
has bought new computers between introduction and the January sales 
month. C7 contains the percentage of the installed user base that will 
purchase another XX/Z computer, and C8 says that these purchases will 
be made over a seven-month period. Row 9 contains the estimated 
monthly history for the sales of the VI computer, while row 10 contains 
the estimate for the XX/Z computer sales compared to the VI sales. For 
example, CIO assumes that the XX/Z will sell 900 percent (or nine times) 
more than the VI. 

Row 1 1 contains the maximum production capacity for our manu- 
facturing facility. We'll use this figure to help calculate the actual manu- 
facturing forecast as an additional section of our forecast. CI 2 contains 
the initial (or beginning) inventory for this manufacturing period, and 
C13, C14, and C15 contain the estimates for the percentages of comput- 
er system sales that each of the three applications products will sell. 

The last area to complete is the computational section. This template 
requires a relatively small computational section. Comparing figures 2 
and 3, you'll notice that these sections have been labeled VARIABLES 
and WORK AREA. As you design more elaborate templates, especially 
templates you don't use or change often, label all individual sections. 
That way, if you decide to alter a model later on, it will be easy to under- 
stand what each section is for. This becomes even more important as a 
model gets more complex. Go ahead and enter the titles in columns A 
and B. Then enter the numbers 1 through 12 in CI through Nl. The re- 
sult should look like figure 3. 

Now to start filling in the blanks. We want to calculate the total sales 
that we estimate we can make to the installed base in C2. Looking back 
at our variables, it's easy to conclude that the percentage of the installed 
base of users to purchase (C7) multiplied by the installed base (C6) 
should determine the total sales of our new computer to the installed 
base. There's a slight glitch, however. Cell C7 contains the value 10. Mul- 
tiplying 10 times 60,000 will not give us the correct answer. 

We could change the 10 in C7 to .1, but there's another solution 
that's much more friendly. It's usually better to refer to a percentage as 
an integer rather than as a decimal because doing so helps make the 
model easier to understand. The secret is to convert the integer value to a 



decimal during the final calculation. You turn 10 percent into a decimal 
by dividing by 100. The formula in C2 should be 

+ C6*(C7/100) 

Now for a challenge. We want to apportion the sales to the installed base 
(in C2) into cells C3 through N3. Each number in row 1 indicates the 
equivalent month in row 18. See if you can determine how to let Visi- 
Cole take the sales to the installed user base in C2 and spread that value 
through the number of months shown in C8. One additional stipulation! 
If the value in C8 is changed to reflect a different number of months, the 
sales to the installed base should be apportioned to reflect the change. In 
other words, the 18,000 sales to the installed base are now spread over 
the first seven months. If you decide that these sales would all occur dur- 
ing the next four months, you should be able to change the value in C8 to 
4 and have 4,500 (1 8,000 divided by 4) displayed only in C3, C4, C5, and 
C6. Hint: You will need to use the values in row 1.

The formula in cell C3 would be 

@IF (C1<=C8,C2/C8,0) 
In English, this reads: if the value in CI is less than or equal to the value 
in C8, display the total installed base sales divided by the number of 
months; otherwise, display a zero. This formula compares the month 
represented by the values in row 1 to the total months, displaying the 
monthly sales calculation only if the number of the month is less than or 
equal to the months to apportion. Thus, any month whose number is 
greater than the value in C8 will not show any sales. Simple! 

Back to the report part of our template. Row 20 will contain the sales 
to the installed base. You have already calculated those sales in row 3, so 
you need only repeat those values in row 20. Enter -I-C3 and /FI in C20 
and replicate that value, using relative reference, into D20 through N20. 

It's interesting to note a couple of things at this point. First, the val- 
ues displayed in row 20 are nothing more than "copies" of the actual cal- 
culations in row 3. Sometimes you will want to keep the calculations sep- 
arate from the display section. But if you wanted to, you could move or 
replicate row 3 to replace row 20, reentering the titles in A20 and B20.

216 % 

The new customer sales in row 21 are a multiple of the historical VI 
sales (row 9) multiplied times the estimated sales percentage of VI sales 
(row 10). This time we'll do our calculations in the report part of the tem- 
plate. Again we'll have to convert the percentages in row 10. The formu- 
la in C21 should be 

+ C9*(C1 0/100) 

Be sure to enter /FI again and replicate the formula into cells DIG 
through NIO. 

Next we want the total forecast sales to be displayed in row 23. The 
entry in C23 is 

/FI @SUM(C19. . .C22) 
Again, replicate C23 into D23 through N23. We've now completed our 
initial forecast. 

Now let's add another twist. A forecast is accurate only if manufac- 
turing can provide enough product to meet that forecast. Suppose the 
forecast figure was greater than the number of computers our manufac- 
turing facilities could produce. Many sales wouldn't get made. 

In order to make our forecast template a more useful tool, we can 
modify it to take production capability into account. In B24 and C24, en- 
ter ESTIM. REMAIN INV (for estimated remaining inventory). This 
will be the amount of inventory remaining after we take the prior 
month's beginning inventory, add the current month's production, and 
subtract the forecast sales for the month. Remember that row 1 1 con- 
tains the manufacturing capability for each month in our forecast. The 
entry in C24 should be 

/FI +C12+C11-C23 
This gives us the ending inventory for January. We can't replicate this en- 
try into the rest of the row without changing it slightly to reference the 
ending January inventory (C24). The entry to make in D24 is 

/FI +C24 + D1 1-D23 
Replicate the formula in D24 into E24 through N24, using relative 
reference. 

The first thing to notice is that the estimated remaining inventory be- 
comes a negative value in March. That means that we're going to start 
the month of April selling computers we don't have. After all, not all of

our manufacturing is accomplished the first day. In order to balance our 
sales forecast against production capability, it's important to remember 
that our manufacturing can only meet the production level shown in row 
1 1. If our beginning inventory plus the manufacturing capability for the 
month is less than our forecast, some units aren't going to be sold. Thus, 
we must modify our original sales forecast to reflect manufacturing 
reality. 

So here's another challenge. Can you devise a method to modify our 
original forecast that wall accurately predict as many sales as possible but 
not forecast so many as to create a "negative" ending inventory? Enter 
PROD/FRCST SALES (a combination of forecast sales and produc- 
tion) in A24 and B24 and complete your sales forecast in row 24. 

Simple, isn't it? Okay, so it isn't simple! There are probably two or 
three ways to accomplish our goal. The one we'll look at now is a little 
more complex than necessary, but it demonstrates how you can com- 
bine functions in fomulas. 

In C25 enter 

/FI @MIN(@IF(C24> = 0,@MIN(C23,C12+C1 1), 
@MAX(C23 + C24,C1 1,C23) 

D25 requires a slightly different formula because the beginning in- 
ventory is in the prior month's report section rather than in the variable 
section. The only difference, other than that the references reflect col- 
umn D, is that CI 2 becomes C24: 

D25: /FI @MIN(@IF{D24>=0,@MIN(D23,C24 + D11), 
@MAX(D23 + D24,D1 1,D23) 

You can replicate C26 with all references relative. 

How would you change the formula to reflect the need for keeping a 
minimal inventory level of 500 units? How would you change it to re- 
flect a different minimal inventory level for each month? You can solve 
these yourself; they should be easy. 

The last section, rows 29 through 31, contains the forecasts for the 
software applications. We had determined that these were based upon a 
strict percentage of forecast computer sales. So the January forecast for 
product 1 sales should be January production forecast sales multiplied by 
our percentage (in CI 3). The entry should be 

/FI +C25*{C1 3/100) 

The entry in C30: 

+ C25*(C14/100) 

The formula in C31 would use the variable in CI 5. Replicate these 
formulas across (using relative and no change references) and our tem- 
plate is complete. 

If you wished to calculate revenue, you could do it by including your 
wholesale price for each of the products in the variable section and com- 
pleting a separate section in the report area that displays the revenue for 
the computer and for each software application sold. To get total reve- 
nue, you'd simply sum these values. 

We mentioned at the beginning that this was to be a one-year rolling 
forecast, meaning that each consecutive month the forecast is changed to 
reflect the activity of the following twelve months. For example, the fore- 
cast in March would include April through the following March, with 
April's forecast "rolling" to include May through April. To make yours 
a rolling forecast, you have only to delete the first forecast column (JAN in 
our template) and replicate another final column. You could move 
(/MOVE) the column and accomplish the same thing. In either case you 
must ensure that the variables are correct for the final month. Just 
moving the column might bring an incorrect production capability and 
thus throw off the complete forecast from that month on. 

And there you have it — a comprehensive forecasting template that 
could be useful in many forecasting applications. Figure 4 shows the 
complete template. If it isn't exactly what you want, it's a simple matter 
to modify it. After all, you've just completed it so you know how it 
works. 

Just remember — no matter how precise your forecast and how well 
you have thought out all the variables, forecasting is just what the dic- 
tionary says: "predicting results." Unless you are very lucky, very good, 
or are predicting the sales of a product whose sales never change, fore- 
casting is just a method of guessing. And occasionally everybody guesses 
incorrectly; some more occasionally than others!

VisiCalc for the Apple lie. Apple Computer recently announced 
the Apple He, and VisiCorp followed suit with an Apple lie version of 
VisiCalc. It is much the same as the current VisiCalc for the Apple II, but 
it has been enhanced to be able to use the Apple He's additional fea- 
tures. For example, it displays upper and lower case, takes advantage of 
the four cursor keys (no need for the space bar to change direction any 



J 217 

more), and uses the backspace key for deleting characters (no more using 
the escape key to delete). In addition, with the accessory memory expan- 
sion board and eighty-column card, the Apple He now has an eighty-col- 
umn screen and 95K of template workspace. If you have an Apple II and 
need more workspace, you may want to check out the Apple lie with 
VisiCalc. lU

five fields within each record. Following the de- 
fault settings, the program will place one field 
on each line, starting on the first position of the 
line. The final parameter will tell the program 
how many blank lines should be printed be- 
tween records. 

If you want to accept the default settings, 
just answer Y to the question of whether they 
are correct, turn on the printer and line up the 
paper, and hit return when you're ready to be- 
gin printing. The program will dump all rec- 
ords to the printer. 

If you want to change one or more of the 
settings, answer N to the question. The settings 
for the first field will be displayed in inverse and 
a prompt line will appear at the bottom of the 
screen asking for the new value for the line on 
which the field should appear. Hit return to ac- 
cept the default or enter a new setting. The next 
prompt will ask for the location on the line at 
which to start the field. Follow the same proce- 
dure for this input. If you only want to change 
one field's location — say, move the miscellane- 
ous field to appear on the same line as the 
phone number — hit return until the prompt and 
the inversed settings indicate the field you want 
to change. 

The printer is assumed to be in slot 1 of your 
Apple. If your printer is in another slot, change 
line 6040 to do a pr# to the correct slot. 

With these sections added to the database, 
you will have a fully integrated database sys- 
tem. The program takes up less than 7K of pro- 
gram memory, so there is plenty of room avail- 
able for any addition you might want to make. 
If you come up with any valuable subroutines 
to add to the program, please send them to the 
Basic Solution care of Softalk so that we can 
share them with other readers.

gives you information about some sound pa- 
rameters of the preset you're currently playing. 
These parameters are easily modifiable in real 
time. 

The AlphaPlus approach uses two oscilla- 
tors in defining each sound, resulting in the sys- 
tem's eight-voice limit. One oscillator is re- 
ferred to as the primary channel, the other as 
the percussive channel. The text window con- 
tains a description for each channel of the 
sound's overall amplitude envelope in numer- 
ically defined unit increments between 0 and 
255, as well as other data, such as variable vi- 
brato rates that can be controlled using a stan- 
dard set of paddles. The pitch window is noth- 
ing more than a dark field on which flickering 
colored squares reflect the pitches currently 
being played. Though this feature imparts no 
information to the user that is useful in com- 
posing music or synthesizing sounds, some may 
find it visually entertaining in moments of 
distraction. 

The record/playback mode allows you to 
sequence eight simultaneously playing layers or 
tracks with an optional metronome to keep the 
tempo for you. During playback you can vary 
the overall speed of a piece without altering its 
original pitches, or create passages that repeat- 
edly loop (a feature the manual misleadingly re- 



from page 88 

elude print options, nor is it structured around 
concepts of traditional notation for developing 
compositions. All you have to do is play what 
you feel and the sequencer will store it or play it 
back for you the way a tape recorder does. 

The audio quality and sound range of the 
system is determined in great part by the Moun- 
tain hardware. In some cases low-pitched 
sounds can be problematic, causing distortion; 
and they can sound strange with certain pa- 
rameter settings because of unbalanced fre- 
quency modulation. Also, some late-model Ap- 
ple II Pluses have an internal interference prob- 
lem with the hardware. This can be remedied by 
installing a noise-reduction capacitor available 
at no extra charge from Mountain Computer. 

Alpha Synthetic Music. Another system 
that is designed around and uses the Mountain 
hardware is the alphaSyntauri digital synthe- 
sizer from Syntauri. The alpha lets you control 
many of the same aspects of additive synthesis 
that the Passport system does, and it too offers 
a multitrack sequencer, but the approach taken 
by the Syntauri software is distinctive. Let's ac- 
knowledge the general similarities between these 
two systems and then concentrate on those fea- 



tures of the alphaSyntauri that set it apart from 
other systems. 

The organ-style keyboard that alphaSyn- 
tauri provides with the system is polyphonic to 
a maximum of eight voices, covers a five-oc- 
tave range, and is velocity-sensitive, causing 
keys struck faster to sound louder. You can 
control the degree of sensitivity with the 
software. 

The keyboard interfaces with the Apple 
through a single circuit board that can reside in 
any free slot. Two foot switches connect to the 
keyboard via standard phone jacks. These con- 
trol sustain and portamento effects; portamen- 
to is either on or off and is limited to a preset, 
unprogrammable rate of modulation. 

Either of two software packages, AlphaPlus 
or Metatrak, can be used to run the system. The 
A IphaPlus package consists of twelve preset files 
of ten sounds each that can be played on the 
keyboard, additive synthesis techniques for 
creating and manipulating waveforms and their 
parameters, and a sequencer for recording up to 
2,000 notes layered to eight multiple tracks. 

When the keyboard is being played in live 
mode, the monitor screen is split into the text 
window and a pitch window. The text window

window. 



fers to as "echo"). You also have the ability to 
stop playback at any time and start recording 
again from that point, a technique commonly 
called "punching in." During playback, the key- 
board is still fully active so you can also play 
along. With the Album file feature, you can 
take two or more sequences you've recorded, 
combine them together under a single file name, 
then play them back consecutively like a record 
album. 

AlphaPlus uses additive synthesis to pro- 
gram waveforms in much the same way that the 
Passport system does. One approach AlphaPlus 
offers is Quickwave, which uses a bar graph to 
plot the fundamental and the harmonics by am- 
plitude for the two oscillators that define a 
sound. By depressing keys on the music key- 
board, you can hear the sounds you devise in 
this manner as you are building them. 

Another optional approach to wave forma- 
tion, called Wave, doesn't allow you to hear 
what you're developing in real time. Going this 
route, a waveform you've worked on must be 
saved first, then reloaded to check it audibly. 
The inconvenience is a tradeoff for the preci- 
sion and fine-tuning of waves that this ap- 
proach gives you. With Quickwave, the har-

monic spectrum allowed extends as far as the 
sixteenth harmonic; with Wave you can specify 
up to 255 harmonics for a sound, which can re- 
sult in some unique emanations from your 
speakers. A program that provides a graphic 
analysis of any wave you load (no audio feed- 
back is given) can be found on disk too. 

User-programmable effects modifications 
for amplitude, chorus effect, pitch bend, and 
pitch scan are available in the AlphaPlus, along 
with the ability to detune the keyboard to units 
of one-thirty-second of a tone or alter its stan- 
dard equal-tempered scaling. 

Metatrak, another package available sepa- 
rately, expands on the features of AlphaPlus 
with the exception of the waveform creation 
programs that Metatrak doesn't contain. 
With Metatrak the sequencer can record a total 
of sixteen simultaneous music passages, to a 
limit of approximately three thousand notes, 
that can then be manipulated or altered the way 
tracks can in AlphaPlus. 

Like AlphaPlus, Metatrak is capable of 
looping segments and punching into individual 
tracks. Beyond that, it offers the ability to fast- 
forward a sequence, erase an unwanted track 
with a single keystroke, and modify the tempo 
of playback tracks while adding a new track at 
another speed. The continual merging of se- 
quencer tracks required in the Passport system 
is unnecessary here, but a mix-down /playback 
step is provided for making final adjustments 
before saving a finished recording. Certain DOS 
commands can be used directly from the pro- 
gram, enabling you to delete or rename files, 
and to lock valuable ones worth protecting. 

Unlike AlphaPlus, Metatrak allows you to 
split the keyboard into from two to eight s^- 
ments and program the splits to occur any- 
where you choose. What's more, every segment 
can be assigned to play a different preset sound, 
and in live mode these assignments can be 
changed in real time. All the specifications of a 
chosen split configuration can also be saved to 
disk for future use. Certain special-effects 
modifications are another departure unique to 
Metatrak. For example, there is timbre scan, an 
audible rate adjustable scan of an entire preset 
master's waveforms that can assume any enve- 
lope characteristics you choose. Pitch sweep and 
keyboard-following vibrato are also available. 

Both AlphaPlus and Metatrak do a good 
job of handling situations in which a wrong in- 
put has been given. The manuals for both sys- 
tems are well written and easy to understand, 
though not indexed. A IphaPlus includes a help- 
ful reference card showing all commands, along 
with a listing describing the preset masters that 
come with the program on disk. All preset mas- 
ters created with AlphaPlus can be loaded and 
used with Metatrak. However, files of composi- 
tions created with AlphaPlus are not compat- 
ible with and cannot be used with Metatrak and 
vice versa. Neither program seems to support 
print options of any kind. 

Because of the way the Metatrak file buffer 
is structured, it is possible to overwrite material 
when using the sequencer to record. Ample 
safety checks and error messages exist that will 



alert you in time before recording if a problem 
of this sort is imminent. Though the articula- 
tion and expression of musical phrases is cer- 
tainly enhanced with the velocity-sensitive key- 
board, the keyboard reaction time when fast 
staccato notes are being played is inconsistent 
and the notes come out with audibly variable 
intensities. 

The new Metatrak II includes the ability to 
sync the output of the system to reel-to-reel tape 
recorders and rhythm machines. AlphaSyntau- 
ri offers some additional useful utilities that 
come as separate packages. Draw Wave allows 
you to draw waveforms using a set of paddles; 
with Auto Pulse you can represent pulse waves 
with duty cycles between 0 and 50 percent with 
precision; and with the B-3 Wavemaker you can 



duplicate almost any setting on a Hammond B- 
3 organ. A series of interactive music theory and 
ear-training programs called MusicMaster is 
also available for use with the aiphaSyntauri 
system. 

Compumusic Console Controller. Compu- 
music from Roland Corporation is not de- 
signed around the Mountain boards. The pe- 
ripheral hardware used in Compumusic consists 
of a small console that interfaces with the Ap- 
ple via a circuit board configurable for any free 
slot. This console is the focus of the system; no 
musical k^board is used here, and it's not pos- 
sible to play compositions in real time. The Ap-

erist to extend the computer's power as a con- 
troller into the realm of analog synthesizers as 
well. For starters, there is a six-voice synthesiz- 
er and a seven-voice drum synthesizer, pro- 
grammable with the software provided on a sin- 
gle disk. The timbres of the Compumusic'' s 
sound-producing oscillators are not program- 
mable; with the software you control only the 
rhythms and pitches, and, to a limited degree, 
expression. 

The hardware integrates an analog mixer 
with sliders for controlling the output to your 
amplifier through standard phone jacks, and 
there's also a clock for controlling overall tem- 
po. A significant feature is the series of control 
outputs that enable you to use the Compumusic 
software to control up to eight external analog 
synthesizers. 



The system is divided into eight channels, 
each sequenced individually. Channel one, the 
melody channel, also has nonprogrammable 
analog controls on the console for manipulat- 
ing the sustain and decay of its sounds. Chan- 
nel two, the bass channel, and channels three 
through six, the chord channels, have similar 
controls available, but only for the decay pa- 
rameter. Channels seven and eight have no 
sound sources of their own and are reserved for 
use in controlling external synthesizers and 
effects. 

All the channels are programmed in the 
same way using the Apple. Note that there are 
separate outputs and volume control sliders on 
the console for melody, bass, chord, and 
rhythm channels respectively, as well as a mas- 
ter slider that controls the volume of the com-

bined output. 

The software that runs Compumusic oper- 
ates very much like a word processor or, in this 
case, a music processor. The single-page main 
menu offers access to the editor screens for each 
channel. Also available are single-keystroke 
commands to play music that's been composed 
using the program, loop music so it plays con- 
tinuously, load and save music files to disk, and 
set the tuning on all channels automatically 
(nonstandard tunings are not supported). 
Examples of music are provided on the pro- 
gram disk for your inspiration. 

To compose or edit, you select the channel 
you wish to work in, then specify the measure 
and step numbers. You can begin or resume 
work at any measure in a composition. Each 
note or rest is considered a step, and each step 
in a piece can be homed in on for modification 
as well. Standard musical notation is eschewed 
in favor of an approach using numbers to spec- 
ify each step in a time sequence, listed on the 
screen in measures and scrolled vertically. 

For each step, the control voltage data, 
which determines each step's pitch in numerical 
form, must first be specified. Numbers from 0 
through 72 span a six-octave range, with each 
octave consisting of twelve steps. Next you spec- 
ify the step time for each note or rest, determin- 
ing its individual duration relative to an arbi- 
trary time base of your choice. The time base 
functions like the time signature in standard no- 
tation; it is the number used to represent a quar- 
ter note, and can range from 1 to 255. For 
example, a time base set at 24 can be evenly di- 
vided by 2, 3, 6, 8, and 12, representing eighth 
notes, eighth-note triplets, sixteenth notes, six- 
teenth-note triplets, thirty-second notes, and 
thirty-second-note triplets respectively. The fi- 
nal numerical value you must set for each step is 
the gate time. This determines a note's articula- 
tion — whether it will sound staccato or slurred. 
In practice, entering these settings for each note 
is less complicated than the description of the 
process may suggest. Each parameter automat- 
ically defaults to the one directly preceding if 
you don't change a setting, saving you from te- 
dious retyping to repeat pitches or time values. 
The settings as you input them remain visible on 
the screen for your reference, and any modifi- 
cations are made, as with a word processor, by 
moving the cursor around the screen with a dia- 
mond of keys. 

Other editor commands allow you to scroll

thesizer on the market is Compumusic's unique 
strength. The control possible with other vol- 
tage-controlled sequencers available pales in 
comparison to the amount of control possible 
with an Apple at the helm. The tradeoff for this 
capability seems to be the limitations of the sys- 
tem's built-in sound-producing oscillators. 
While triggering their playing patterns is com- 
pletely programmable, there is no way to alter 
their timbres, short of some form of external ef- 
fects modification to the output. 

The software approach takes a little time to 
get familiar with, but you sense it's working 
with you, not against you. Commands are 
straightforward, usually single-keystroke, and 
screen formats are accessible and direct. The 
manual moves succinctly from simple to more 
refined features of the system. Ways of effect- 
ing complex rhythms, syncopations, trills, glis- 
sando, and grace notes are discussed, but the 
book doesn't have all the answers. The exam- 
ples take you as far as illustrating the musical 
tools Compumusic makes available. You are left 
sparked by the challenge of applying them to 
their fullest potential in your own musical 
creations. 

Although the software provided by Roland 
is all that's available now, the Compumusic is 
open-ended and alternative software ap- 
proaches that users can develop will no doubt 
evolve to explore the system's range. This foray 
by a reputable long-established manufacturer of 
synthesizers, rhythm machines, and amplifiers 
reflects the burgeoning interest of electronic in- 
strument manufacturers in developing prod- 
ucts that integrate or use existent microcom- 
puter technology. 

MIDI Music Mover. Synthesizers have his- 
torically developed along nonstandardized or 
variously standardized lines, resulting in differ- 
ing control voltages and output levels among 
the devices available. Similarly, even micro- 
computer-based synthesizer equipment from 
various manufacturers has developed along in- 
dependent, incompatible lines. The prolifera- 
tion of the home-computer market has forced 
those producing synthesizers to address the 
issue of equipment incompatibility. 

Artists using electronic music equipment 
professionally desire the expanded capabilities 
of current technology that microcomputer con- 
trol provides, as well as the potential creative 
benefits of interfacing systems developed by dif- 
ferent manufacturers. With interfaced, expand- 
able systems, a musician's costly investments 
are secured in equipment thereby protected 
from obsolescence. 

Music industry concern with these issues has 
led to the development of the Musical Instru- 
ment Digital Interface specification (MIDI). 
MIDI is really nothing more than an informal 
agreement between electronic equipment manu- 
facturers on some simple standard interface cir- 
cuitry, and on the grammar of a nonproprie- 
tary language to carry meaningful information 
between various instruments. This makes it pos- 
sible to devise a multi-instrument, completely 
programmable music system, consisting of de- 
vices from various manufacturers interfaced via

MIDI, and which is entirely software con- 
trolled from an Apple or other microcomputer. 

Synthesizers using MIDI can be configured 
in parallel, each playing individually or simul- 
taneously, mono or polyphonically, using a 
single computer to create and edit sequences 
and compositions. MIDI also makes possible 
the development of software to generate hard 
copy of a composition or improvisation, aid in 
teaching music education and electronic synthe- 
sis skills and theory, and integrate video syn- 
thesis with music synthesis. Even with MIDI, 
though, the total control features available are 
still dependent on the design of each specific 
unit. MIDI enables different types of equip- 
ment to communicate at their least common 
level, but it won't transcend inherent limita- 
tions or features that make each synthesizer 
unique. For example, design differences make 
the transference of specific programmed sounds 
between various models of synthesizers impos- 
sible, but keyboard data and program selec- 
tions could be communicated. 

On a given piece of equipment, the pres- 
ence of MIDI is not apparent because it is built 
right in. Its only physical indication is a couple 
of five-pin DIN jacks on the unit, which are 
needed to connect various instruments to one 
another or to a controller card in the computer. 
Information is transferred to and from the com- 
puter serially, at 31.25 kilobaud, asynchronous. 

The incorporation of MIDI in a product 
line remains optional for each equipment manu- 
facturer. MIDI is new, so it has not been fully 
integrated in all units produced by manufactur- 
ers who do support it. Sequential Circuits be- 
gan shipping the Prophet-600 polyphonic syn- 
thesizer at the end of last year, the first model in 
its line featuring MIDI. Specifications on the 
structure of MIDI and its data formatting are 
made available through Sequential Circuits to 
programmers/musicians interested in develop- 
ing software for the Apple using the interface. 
Roland Corporation will also be manufactur- 
ing equipment that supports MIDI. 

Chroma's Subtractive Synthesis. An 
Apple-interfaceable system that takes an alto- 
gether different approach from the others is the 
Rhodes Chroma developed by Fender/Rog- 
ers/Rhodes for CBS. The Chroma is a sixteen- 
oscillator, sixteen-channel, programmable poly- 
phonic synthesizer, sporting a touch-sensitive, 
velocity-sensitive, five-octave keyboard. 

The unit has fifty preset voices that may be 
combined two at a time or played separately by 
splitting the keyboard in half at any designated 
point. The fifty voice-select switches on the 
Chroma's front panel also double as very de- 
tailed sound parameter controls when the 
instrument is in programming mode, allow- 
ing you to create very finely tuned sounds 
stored digitally in Chroma's onboard memory. 
Unlike the Mountain, Passport, and Syn- 
tauri systems. Chroma employs a subtractive 
synthesis approach exclusively. All ma- 
nipulable parameters usually associated with 
the subtractive synthesis are offered, each pro- 
grammable to a high degree of incremental 
precision. 



The patch switch on the Chroma's front 
panel gives the user access to an important vari- 
able not usually manipulable to such a high de- 
gree on other synthesizers. This switch enables 
you to choose the overall configurations of the 
synthesizer's channels, which determines the 
routing of signals from the oscillators through 
the filters to the amplifiers. Altogether, sixteen 
different channel configurations are possible. 
Other features include touch-of-a-button pa- 
rameter editing, the ability to copy parameters 
from one preset to another, the autotuning of 
all oscillators, transpose functions, foot 
switches for controlling sustain and for step- 
ping through presets, and an interface port for 
tape-cassette storage of preset banks. 

Sound parameters are not controlled on the 
Chroma with accessible knobs and dials but are 
input individually in numeric form. This ap- 
proach limits your ability to change parameter 
settings in real time; you can change only one. 
Players accustomed to being able to reach out 
and change any settings during a performance 
may find this unsatisfying. This is the tradeoff 



mately eighteen hundred sixty notes, with the 
actual capacity dependent upon the amount of 
performance control changes entailed; it also re- 
cords such performance nuances as key veloci- 
ty and pressure sensitivity. A Scrunch utility will 
net an extra hundred notes or so. 

After a sequence is recorded, it can be saved 
to disk along with all the presets that went into 
making it. Sequences can also be looped and 
finely edited down to changing or deleting 
notes, velocities, or other performance con- 
trols. The voices and volumes of individual se- 
quenced tracks can be altered, as can the tempo. 

Because of the fine-tuning possible, the edit- 
ing process can get rather involved. There also 
seem to be a few ways of losing sequences in the 
process of editing. The editor does not automati- 
cally alert you to these danger points when en- 
countered. A good amount of time is required 
to learn how to take full advantage of this pro- 
gram's potential. 

Numerous utility programs come with the 
Chroma system. The extensive manual gives de- 
tailed information about the system to enable

terminal from Fender/ 
Rogers/Rhodes has a 
control panel with fifty 
presets and a keyboard 
that provides touch 
sensitivity. 



for the increased power that the Chroma's digi- 
tal control provides. 

The Chroma becomes a music terminal 
when connected to the Apple via an interface 
card that goes in slot 5 (reconfigurable). All in- 
formation input to the Chroma is now acces- 
sible through the Apple. This includes all com- 
mands used to set up the voices, as well as all 
performance information. 

A set of applications programs on two disks 
comes with the Apple interface kit (two drives 
recommended). This allows you to perform se- 
quencing, editing, and data storage functions. 
This sequencer is fully polyphonic and can re- 
cord up to sixteen independent tracks, each 
played, with an optional click track, in real time 
on the Chroma keyboard. The program's disk 
menu is long, but the options are straightfor- 
ward enough. The menu length is more a re- 
flection of the range of control available to the 
user than anything else. 

The capacity of the sequencer is approxi- 



users/ musicians to write their own software for 
the Chroma. Four such utilities are provided as 
examples on disk. The system manual offers de- 
tailed instructions on how to interface the 
Chroma with other sequencers, rhythm ma- 
chines, and the expander module that's manu- 
factured to double its capabilities. 

The Chroma has been built for the profes- 
sional musician, and the sounds that this sys- 
tem can produce are exceptional. Computerists 
with a flair for hacking are likely to find pro- 
gramming the Chroma a challenge. For a mu- 
sician unfamiliar with sound synthesis or mi- 
crocomputers, the programming approach the 
Apple interface makes possible might prove for- 
midable. 

It seems certain that systems like MIDI and 
the Chroma will act as catalysts in bringing to- 
gether talents from distinct disciplines, and will 
help to engender the proliferation of a new 
breed of composer, who embodies the valuable 
qualities of both artist and technologist. Hi

Tools of the Craft, Part 23 

This is the second of a series on Apple Pascal compiler directive in- 
structions (called "compiler options" in Apple's official manuals). Last 
month, we looked at the general nature and use of compiler directives 
and experimented with specific directives that incorporated the instruc- 
tions I (Include a source file) and S (compiler Swapping). These instruc- 
tions permit the compiler to process (and thus allow the programmer to 
write) arbitrarily large source programs. 

If you missed the previous column, you can prime yourself for this 
month's discussion by skimming chapter 4 in the Apple's Pascal Lan- 
guage Reference Manual — especially the sections on the I and S 
"options." 

Program Listings. You have no doubt noticed that the larger a program 
gets the harder it becomes to visualize its construction and operation in 
your mind's eye. You simply cannot remember all the niggling details 
about every little function and routine, nor do you want to. One of the 
most important reasons for dividing a program into a collection of rou- 
tines in the first place is to permit you to hide the trivial (or messy) de- 
tails of implementation behind meaningful names. 

From time to time, however, you'll need to reacquaint yourself with 
the nuts and bolts of your program in order to correct or improve it. You 
could, of course, content yourself with using the Editor to view the vari- 
ous parts of your program as necessary. However, most useful routines 
contain more than twenty-four lines of text and so cannot be displayed 
on the video screen all at once. Furthermore, in trying to repair incorrect 
code, you may wish to execute the program and correlate its "observed 
behavior" with that which you are led to expect from reading the source 
text. Of course, it is usually impossible for the Apple Pascal system to dis- 
play a program's source text and the results produced by its execution on 
the same screen at the same time; the Editor (or Filer) simply cannot exe- 
cute simultaneously with your program. 

One excellent way of dealing with such situations is to use a printed 
listing of the source text. Because an 8 Vi -by-1 1 sheet of paper can hold at 
least twice the textual information that the standard Apple's video 
screen can display, a program listing permits the typical procedure or 
function to be viewed in its entirety, all at once, thus speeding your com- 
prehension of its structure and operation. Since the program listing is ex- 
ternal to the computer, you may refer to it even while the object code is 
executing. Finally, if the machine-readable copy of the source text on 
disk is erased or otherwise contaminated, you can use a listing as your 
guide in retyping all or part of the affected source files. 

Getting a Listing: Tlie L Instruction. The compiler directive in- 
struction L may be followed by either a name parameter (an arbitrary se- 
quence of printable characters — for more information, see last month's 
column) or a switch setting {+ or — ). When given a name parameter, this 
instruction causes the compiler to put a readable listing of the source, as 
compiled, onto the device or into the file named by the parameter. When 
given a switch setting, the L instruction simply enables or disables the 
listing facility. 

In order to initiate the generation of a program listing, you must is- 
sue the L instruction with a name parameter. The following directive 



specifies PRINTER: as the listing destination: 
(*$L PRINTER:*) 

If you want the entire source program to be listed on the PRINTER: de- 
vice, place the directive at the beginning of a program's master source 
file. The directive 

(*$L MYPROGLST.TEXT*) 

routes the listing to MYPROGLST.TEXT. You must specify the .TEXT 
suffix explicitly if you want the compiler to produce a text file that can be 
read by the Editor. 

Depending on the speed of your printer and the length of your pro- 
gram, the process of getting a listing can take many minutes, or even an 
hour or more. When making changes in a program, you may often wish 
to list only the modified portions in order to save time. Accordingly, you 
may use the directive 

(*$L-*) 

to turn off the listing facility, and 
(*$L+*) 

to turn it back on again. If you try to turn on the listing facility without 
specifying a listing destination — that is, if L-l- is the first L instruction the 
compiler encounters while translating your program — the listing is 
routed to the file *SYSTEM.LST.TEXT. 

The Anatomy of a Listing. The figure at the end of this article shows 
a typical program listing. Five pieces of information appear on the left- 
hand side of each source line. They are, in order from left to right, the 
line number, segment number, procedure number, lexical level indica- 
tor, and the I-count. 

In the listing, every line of source code bears a unique line number. 
Although these numbers are insignificant to the compiler and to the 
Pascal system in general, they serve as convenient points of reference for 
the human reader and thus ease the examination of any particular 
program. 

As mentioned last time, you may organize your program into one or 
more "segments." A segment is a collection of routines that can be 
erased fi-om RAM memory as a whole whenever space is tight and none of 
the routines in the segment is being used. Later, when any of its routines 
are called, the entire segment is reloaded into memory from disk, so long 
as sufficient RAM is available to contain it. The compiler and Pascal sys- 
tem identify each segment by its segment number. As implied by the figure, 
the compiler assumes that all routines, and the main program body as 
well, should be placed into segment number 1 . In a future article, we'll 
study special techniques you can use to force the compiler to put p-code 
into segments other than 1 , so as to optimize a program's utilization of 
limited RAM memory. 

A given segment of code may include many different procedures and 
functions. Relative to its own segment, each routine bears its own unique 
procedure number. If you look at the listing of the program TinyCalc in 
the figure, you'll see that the routines SkipBlanks, Goodlnteger, GoodOp, 



230 



^ O P T A I K 



MAY 1983 



and GoodExpr have been given the procedure numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 re- 
spectively. The main body of code in any segment is given procedure 
number 1 for that segment. Thus, TinyCalc's main program body is pro- 
cedure number 1 in segment number 1. 

Suppose your program contains two different segments, 1 and 11. 
Each of those segments may contain a "procedure number 5," just as 
someone in another telephone area may have the same phone number as 
you do. However, no more than one procedure may bear the number 5 
in any one segment, just as you are the only one within your area code to 
have your telephone number. 

The lexical level indicator is attached by a colon to the right of the 
procedure number in every line of a program listing. This indicator is a 
capital D for every line that occurs within a declaration section. Other- 
wise, it is a digit that indicates the level of statement nesting that exists as 
of the end of the corresponding source line. For instance, consider the 
function Goodlnteger. Lexical level zero corresponds to a primary body 
of code. Thus, the BEGIN and END that envelop Goodlnteger's body 
exist at lexical level zero. The WHILE-statement that begins on line 123 
is nested one level deeper still, so its lexical level is one. Conceptually, the 
loop body is nested within the WHILE-statement, so the BEGIN and 
END of that body exist at lexical level two. Finally, the actual working 
statements of the WHILE-body are nested within BEGIN and END, at 
lexical level three. 

If you get caught on a wet or blustery day with nothing better to do, 
you might like to test your understanding of Pascal statement nesting by 
trying to guess which lexical level the compiler will report for arbitrary 
lines of source code taken from one of your programs. You win when- 
ever you agree with the program listing. Here are the principles you 
should keep in mind in order to master the game: 

1. An entire procedure body is considered as a single compound 
statement and exists at lexical level zero. 

2. Any other statement exists at a lexical level that is one greater than 
that of the statement enclosing it. 

3. Two statements separated from each other by a semicolon exist at 
the same lexical level. 

4. "Framing" information (including such keywords as BEGIN, 
END, WHILE, CASE, WITH, and so on) exists at the lexical lev- 
el of the complex statement to which it belongs. For example, lines 
123 and 124 consist of "framing" keywords and expressions for 
the WHILE-statement that is introduced there. All the code in 
these lines exists at lexical level one. 

For practice, review the WHILE-loop of lines 123 through 129 (in order 
to verify that the compiler followed the rules above) in determining lexi- 
cal levels. 

A particular routine may consist of scores or hundreds of p-codes, 
and thus occupy scores or hundreds of bytes of RAM memory. (There is 
an upper limit on the size of a procedure body, however. The p-machine 
architecture prevents the body of any procedure or function from con- 
taining more than 1,200 bytes of code.) The sequence of jT-codes that the 
compiler generates for any given Pascal statement lies a certain number 
of bytes beyond the beginning of the procedure body. Consider Tiny- 
Calcs function, SkipBlanks. Its first statement translates into a sequence 
of p-codes four bytes long, starting precisely at the beginning of the body 
(that is, zero bytes beyond it). The p-codes corresponding to the second 
statement start four bytes away from the beginning, while those that 
match the third statement start twenty-eight bytes away from the begin- 
ning. (Remember that the second statement, a WHILE-loop, itself con- 
tains an assignment statement that is not counted separately.) The off- 
sets 0, 4, and 28 are the I-comts (instruction counts) for the first, second, 
and third statements in SkipBlanks. Note that the phrase "instruction 
counts" is a misnomer, since the I-count corresponds not to p-code in- 
structions but to individual bytes of p-code. The I-count may be used 
along with the segment and procedure numbers in pinpointing the pre- 
cise location at which a program fails during execution. 

Simple Debugging with the Compiler Listing. The compiler listing 
provides a vague illustration of the correspondence between the source 
version of your program and the executable p-code version that is pro- 
duced by the compiler. You can demonstrate this in a very memorable 
fashion by compiling and executing TinyCalc. This program incorpo- 



rates a subtle error in logic that cannot be detected at compile time and 
only becomes apparent during execution whenever you provide certain 
erroneous input. 

TinyCalc is designed to display the results of simple arithmetic on 
pairs of numbers. It expects each line of input either to be empty or to 
contain a single simple expression. An empty input line signals TinyCalc 
that the user wants to quit. A simple expression consists of an Integer lit- 
eral, followed by an operator and, finally, a second Integer literal. Either 
or both of the literals may be negative. For purposes of TinyCalc, an 
"operator" is a single character (-I-, — , *, or /) that stands for one of the 
operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Both 

3 + 5 
and 

-32/8 

are examples of proper expressions. 

TinyCalc is somewhat friendly, in that it ignores blanks that precede 
or follow literals or operators, such as in 

3 * 24 

which is perfectly acceptable input that yields a result of 72. Also, the 
program responds with a helpful error message whenever its input does 
not conform to the syntax for an expression. For instance, try feeding 

TinyCalc 

three times three 

or 

123 + 456 / 789 

and see what happens. In the first case, the program will recognize right 
away that "three" is not a proper Integer literal. Such input cannot pos- 
sibly be an expression. The second example contains too many items; a 
proper expression contains exactly two Integer literals, separated by one 
of)erator. "Chain" operations are not permitted. 

What happens when you provide only a single Integer hteral, say 
1 234, as input? Try it! Afterward, your screen should resemble the fol- 
lowing 

: 1234 



Value range error 
S# 1, P# 4, l# 23 
Type < space > to continue 

This indicates that something has gone seriously wrong with your 
program. The situation is so bad, in fact, that the operating system has 
had to interrupt TinyCalc's execution. As soon as you press the space 
bar, the Pascal system will reinitialize itself, and you'll be left wondering 
what you did to deserve this harsh rebuke. 

Even if you didn't already know that TinyCalc contains a deliberate 
error, the message at the bottom of your screen certainly suggests that 
something is not right within the program. What's more, it even tells you 
where to begin looking for the problem. Before you press the space bar, 
make note of the S (Segment), P (Procedure), and I (I-Count) numbers 
that are reported in the error message. Then, match them against the 
corresponding numbers in the TinyCalc listing. 

The closest match occurs at line 171, where the S, P, and I numbers 
are 1 , 4, and 21 resp)ectively. This implies that the point at which the pro- 
gram fails lies somewhere within the code that evaluates the CASE-se- 
lector S[TSP]. 

When it occurs during access of an indexed variable, such as an ar- 
ray or String, a value range error usually indicates the use of an unaccept- 
ably large or small index. If you take the time to examine r/>?>'Ca/c thor- 
oughly, you'll see that the value of TSP is derived from that of SP, which 
is in turn derived (ultimately) from the value stored in the global vari- 
able ILInx. The nature of the operations performed on these variables 
guarantees that they'll never contain values less than one, which is the 
smallest value that can be used to index any String. 

It must be, then, that TSP grows larger than Length(S). In fact, this 



MAY 1983 



231 



is exactly what happens when you provide only a single Integer as input 
to TinyCalc. GoodExpr calls Goodlnteger to determine the number that 
is expected to be on the left side of the expression. In this example, Good- 
Integer finds the String representation of 1234, translates that into an 
Integer, and leaves SP pointing to the character position that lies just be- 
yond (to the right oO the literal. Since the literal is the only thing in the 
input line, SP becomes equal to (Length(S) -I- 1). 

Next comes the call to GoodOp. Immediately, the local variable TSP 
is assigned the value of SP, which is (Length(S) -H 1) in this instance. As 
in the other TinyCalc routines, TSP is used as a provisional version of 
SP. Its value becomes the permanent value of SP if, and only if, a proper 
operator character is found after zero or more blanks, beginning at posi- 
tion SP in S. Obviously, there are no blanks to be skipped in this exam- 
ple, so control passes quickly to the CASE statement. Since you may not 
index a String using any value greater than the dynamic Length of that 
String, TSP now represents an illegal index. At this point, control passes 
automatically to the operating system's error-handling routine, which is- 
sues an error message and susj^ends TinyCalc?, execution. 

Even with this "bug," TinyCalc operates without mishap for all ac- 
ceptable input and formost unacceptable input. It fails only when given a 
single Integer literal. While common sense indicates that this case won't 
occur often, one of Murphy's Laws (in its original form) states that if 
there is a wrong way for a person to perform a given task, somebody will 
eventually try it. So, we should take steps now to plug this hole before 
some unlucky user falls through it. 

Fortunately, repairing GoodOp is a simple matter. Since the CASE 
selector is invalid only when TSP is larger than Length(S), we need only 
guard the CASE statement with a suitable IF-clause: 



etc. 

IF (SkipBlanks(S, TSP) = 0) 
THEN 

(* No problem — either 0 or nonzero is okay. *); 
(* What operator is it? *) 

IF (TSP< = Length(S)) (* This "IF" fixes "the last bug" *) 
THEN 

CASE S[TSP] OF 
'+': 
BEGIN 

TDest := Add; 

etc. 



When TSP is too large, the CASE statement will be skipped, and 
TDest will retain its initial value of NoOp. Thus, neither Dest nor SP will 
be updated at the end of the function call, and the value returned by 
GoodOp will be False, properly reflecting the lack of an operator in the 
input. 

Of course, most debugging chores are not as straightforward as this 
one, which was made even simpler because our discussion proceeded di- 
rectly to the heart of the matter and avoided the wrong guesses that 
plague almost every attempt at troubleshooting. Despite all this, per- 
haps you are beginning to appreciate the usefulness of having a "com- 
piler listing" handy when something goes wrong with your program. 

Ejecting a Page during Listing: P. The P instruction is used to force 
the remainder of the compiler listing to start at the top of a new page. 
The compiler knows nothing about the dimensions of a printer page and 
does not leave top and bottom margins. It simply sends line after line 
of output to the device or file specified as the listing destination. 

With the P instruction, you may compensate a bit for the primitive 
nature of the compiler's listing facility. For instance, you might want to 
use it before each procedure or function heading so as to place each im- 
portant component of your program on its own output page. 

When the compiler encounters the directive: 

(*$P*) 



it transmits the ASCII form-feed character, Chr(12), to the listing device 
or file before conveying the line that contains the directive. Most mod- 
em printers respond to the form-feed character by advancing the paper 
to the top of the next page. If you should direct the compiler listing to the 
CONSOLE: device, be aware that the Apple's CRT screen goes blank 
upon receipt of a form-feed character. This is the video equivalent of ad- 
vancing to a new page. Note also that some output devices ignore 
Chr(12) and so will fail to respond properly (if at all) to the P instruction. 

Directly Ahead. The original plans for this month's column also 
called for an examination of the compiler's contribution to Apple Pas- 
cal's "immune system," the means by which the operating system pro- 
tects itself against renegade programs. The bad news is that we don't 
have enough space for that this time. The good news is that not only will 
we cover the "immune system" next month, but we will conclude our 
first look at compiler directives with an introductory discussion of the 
mysterious "U-" instruction, which has aroused intense curiosity 
among Apple Pascal programmers ever since the system was first re- 
leased. Apple's traditional policy toward this instruction has been to re- 
lease as little useful information about it as possible. To learn the com- 
pelling reasons behind this pohcy, don't miss next month's installment.

LOCK-IT-UP 

DISKETTE COPY-PROTECTION 
AND DUPLICATION SYSTEMS 
FOR THE APPLE COMPUTER 

The Lock-lt-Up systems are sophisticated, menu driven 
copy-protection and duplication utilities for the Apple II 
Computer. They feature several levels of protection which 
make standard diskettes uncopyable by even the most 
sophisticated nibble copy programs currently available. 

• All sectors on the diskette can still be used. 

• Data files can be loaded and/or saved to either the protected diskette 
or an unprotected diskette. 

• Mennory will be cleared and the disk will reboot if the reset key is 
pushed. 

• The copying systems support up to 14 disk drives. 

• Complete data-verification is optional during copy. 

• Sequential serial numbers are assigned to each diskette produced by 
the system 

• Master diskettes created with the system contain an I.D. stamp that 
you select. The I.D. stamp must be correctly specified before any 
diskettes can be duplicated. This prevents other Lock-lt-Up owners 
from copying your diskettes. 

• Extensive support is provided should you have any problems or 
special needs. 

• Our system is supported by numerous disk copying services should 
you need a large quantity of diskettes duplicated. 

Either system is available for $225, which includes three diskettes, an 
informative manual, and a non-exclusive license to copy as many 
diskettes as needed.

tion of even complex multiple-file transfers with 
handshaking. Twenty-three high-level commands 
include DM/., CATALOG, SEND, RECEIVE, 
ONERR, HANGUP, MONITOR and Others which 
may be executed in immediate command mode 
interactively or from a file transfer macro com- 
mand file which has been previously entered 
and saved on disk. 

Built-in utilities 

Softerm disk utilities allow DOS commands such 
as CATALOG, INIT RENAME, and DELETE to be 
executed allowing convenient file maintenance. 
Local file transfers allow files to be displayed, 
printed, or even copied to another file without 
exiting the Softerm program. Numerous editing 
options such as tab expansion and space com- 
pression are provided to allow easy reformatting 
of data to accommodate the variations in data 
formats used by host computers. Softerm sup-

Hi 




When dealing with graphics on the Apple (or any other computer, 
for that matter), one of the limiting factors is the great amount of stor- 
age that graphic information requires. On the Apple, a hi-res picture in 
RAM takes almost one-quarter of the available programming memory 
(8K of approximately 36K., after DOS and other scratch areas are sub- 
tracted). On an Apple disk, you can typically fit only twelve hi-res screen 
pictures. Although there's not much to do about the amount of display 
RAM required, there are ways to scrunch more pictures onto disks. 

As far as we know, Dave Lubar wrote the first picture-packing rou- 
tines for the Apple about two years ago. Since then several others have 
been written, including a few direct modifications to Lubar's original 
routines. What's a picture packer? It's a program that takes a standard 
picture, stored in its full, glorious 8,192 bytes of memory, and looks for 
patterns that allow condensing of the information. (The implication is 
that one also needs a picture unpacker that will take the packed picture 
and put it back the way it was.) 

Simple? Ah, but how does one look for the patterns? Which patterns 
pack the most efficiently? One of the best packers around is the one writ- 
ten by Dav Holle (you may recognize his name as the author of Zoom 
Graflx, coauthor in charge of graphics and various and sundry other de- 
tails in Sherwood Forest, and, if you're very astute, the Pie Man cartoon- 
ist). As HoUe puts it, his routines, as well as most others, are variations 
on Lubar's originals. Simply evolution at work. (Is it okay to talk about 
evolution, or does this mean that Softalk can't be read in certain 
schools now?) 

In Dave Lubar's original packer, the basic idea was to look for any 
repeated values in the hi-res screen and lump them together so that 
screen values like 80 80 80 80 80, in sequence, would generate the packed 
code 05 80, meaning 80 repeated five times. Since the screen takes the 
memory addresses from 8192 to 16383(base 10 addresses; $2000 through 
$3FFF in hexadecimal), the packing could occur sequentially in RAM 
rather than worrying about where on-screen the values are displayed. We 
do know that sequential bytes are displayed next to each other horizon- 
tally on-screen, so, for example, if the top third of the screen was black, 
each of the horizontal lines in that area would pack nicely. 

The first problem arises from the fact that colors other than black or 
white don't create a byte pattern that repeats every byte. As we dis- 
covered a little earlier in this series, the colors that have every other bit set 
require one value in even bytes and a different value in odd bytes. See fig- 
ure 1 for a refresher on the type of pattern for these colors. The result is 
that colors other than black or white wouldn't pack at all using this 
method. The solution to this problem is to have the program try packing 
twice — once checking every byte sequentially, and the second time try- 
ing every other byte for patterns and zipping through the screen twice. 



once for all even bytes and again for all odd bytes. The two trials could 
then be compared to see which was more efficient.

$2A 



That works better, but all the single, unique bytes still cause a prob- 
lem. Since we're using pairs of bytes, one to tell how many repetitions 
and another to tell what repeats, patterns such as 55 55 55 55 55 00 00 00 
42 42 42 42 pack nicely into 05 55 03 00 04 42. Unfortunately, patterns 
such as 55 00 46 93 FF A8 become 01 55 01 00 01 46 01 93 01 FF 01 A8. 
Not much savings there. . . . 

A close approximation of Lubar's final algorithm (leaving out a cou- 
ple of minor changes for clarity's sake) is to have the first byte in the pair 
count up to 127 repetitions (call this number N). The number 127 can be 
represented in seven bits. The eighth bit tells whether the following are N 
unique bytes, or one byte repeated N times. Using this technique, a pat- 
tem such as 85 79 A2 55 55 55 55 00 00 34 21 would be packed as (83) 85 
79 A2 (04) 55 (02) 00 (82) 34 21. The bytes in parentheses represent the 
various values of N. Note that the 8 in the first position tells you that the 
high bit is set, so in the example we have three unique bytes first, then 
four repetitions of 55 followed by two repetitions of 00, and then two 
more unique bytes. 

Well, Lubar's routine was really exciting. Suddenly we were able to 
get twenty-five to forty pictures on a disk, sometimes even more. Pic- 
tures that used to take thirty-four sectors of disk storage now took some- 
where between seven and twenty-five sectors, in most cases. But, alas, 
there are always better ways. An analysis of a hypothetical hi-res screen 
will indicate the next step. Figure 2 is a scaled-down version of what the 
hi-res screen looks like, more or less. 

Notice that the little lines in the diagram, which divide up the picture 
into bytes, are very close together as you move down the screen and not 
so close as you move across the screen. Bytes, when displayed in hi-res, 
are one dot tall and seven dots wide. Okay, big deal. We'll look at the il- 
lustration and figure out approximately what percent of the lines across 
the screen go the full forty bytes uninterrupted by the writing. Then scan 
the area vertically and figure approximately what percent of the area can

be covered by patches of repeated bytes. The answer is that you are more 
likely to find more repetitions when scanning vertically instead of hori- 
zontally. When scanning horizontally, you have to go all the way across 
the screen uninterrupted to get only forty repeating bytes. Scanning ver- 
tically, you are more likely to find repeating bytes because they are all in 
the same general area of the picture. In fact, as this picture is drawn, you 
would have more than four hundred bytes repeating on the left side be- 
fore you ran into the letter A. Even then, there is a good amount of repe- 
tition vertically between the words and even in letters such as H. 

So the trick is that scanning according to the screen instead of in 
memory sequence does make a difference, and it's on this premise that 
Holle based his packing routine. He did make a couple of other modifi- 
cations to improve the efficiency. The first modification is sort of like the

first modification to Lubar's routine. As you'll recall from our experi- 
menting with color combinations, any color fill routine that creates more 
than the six Apple colors uses a two-line pattern. Remember when we 
made the odd horizontal lines orange and the even ones green and came 
out with a simulated yellow? That yellow, and every other blended col- 
or, would easily defeat Holle's idea for vertical packing unless it was 
done in two passes. The first pass does the odd lines and the second pass 
does the even lines. 

Holle's second modification was to eliminate the necessity for repeat 
factors before unique values. To do so, he used a little trickery. For each 
repeated section he uses three bytes; a zero to signal repeated values, then 
a number from 1 to 255 to tell how many repetitions, then the repeated 
value. Unique bytes are just put directly into the table. When the un- 
packer finds a zero, it knows that the next byte contains the number of 
times the byte after that repeats. What about screen values of 0? He just 
changes them to $80. ASOO byte is black with the high bit off, and $80 is 
black with the high bit on, but they both look the same on-screen. Ac- 
tually, it turns out that the major savings in this approach is that you can 
have repetitions up to 255 times instead of Lubar's 127, but as often as 
that occurs it probably doesn't matter much. Technically, it does elimi- 
nate one possibility in Lubar's: In his routine, it is actually possible for 
the packed picture to take more space than the original. This occurs if 
few or none of the values repeat; since there are flags every 128 bytes that 
say that the following 128 bytes are unique, those extra bytes would 
make the picture longer. Practically, it hardly ever happens, and Holle's 
three bytes for repjetitions equally balance Lubar's one for nonrepeating 
values. 

So the listing at the end of this article is Dav Holle's variation on 
Dave Lubar's original packing ideas, slightly modified. The routine as 
listed is assembled at $6000, decimal 24576, just above hi-res page two. It 
is 248 bytes long, and contains both the packer and unpacker. 

If you want to assemble it somewhere else, change the ORG instruc- 
tion in line 1 . Those of you who tinker in machine language without the 
benefit of an assembler can relocate the routine by changing the six 
places in the code that call locations $605A and $60EF with JSR 
instructions. 

There are three locations to set before calling either routine. In loca- 
tions 0 and 1, poke the starting address of your packed picture table. This 
is the address where you want the packer to put the packed information, 
or the address where you bloaded a packed picture file. The address is 
stored in low/high format, which means that, if your address is A, you'd 
use the following pokes (in line 10 we give A a value of 24832, which is as 
good a location as any, since it's right above the pack/ unpack routines): 

10 A = 24832 

20 POKE 0, A - INT (A / 256) * 256 
30 POKE 1, INT(A / 256) 

In location 230 ($E6), poke the value corresponding to the hi-res 
screen you want packed, or onto which you want the packed picture un- 
packed. Poke 230,32 for page one, and poke 230,64 for page two. Note 
that this location in most operations also tells the computer which hi-res 
screen is being drawn upon; this gives you a nifty trick for displaying one 
page while drawing on the invisible one. 

After the above pokes, call 24576 if you want to unpack a picture, or 
call 24700 if you want a picture packed. After return from the routine, lo- 
cations 0 and 1 hold the last address in the packed table. These two pro- 
grams are examples of using the packer and unpacker respectively.

Those are bare-bones examples only, designed to show the essentials 
of using the Pack/ Unpack routines. The next program is a little more 
complete example. It allows you to pack pictures in memory and un- 
pack pictures from the disk using either hi-res screen. If you want to pack 
a picture, you'll have to bload it into memory before running the 
program. 

Lines 10 through 170 ask for input on the options you want to use. 
Lines 200 through 250 handle packing, and 300 through 330 do unpack- 
ing. These are the essential necessary commands, like those in the pre- 
vious listings. As is often the case, most of the program is devoted to su- 
pervising neat and, for the most part, error-protected input. The last 
part, lines 400 through 450, simply allows you to repeat the cycle or quit.

Note that .pic was used at the end of the file name to denote a pic- 
ture in standard format in these programs. The suffix .pac was also used 
to denote a packed picture file. When playing with graphics you tend to 
get a lot of different types of binary files on your disks. Using something 
in the name to designate what type of file it is helps determine if some- 
thing called Frog is a picture, a packed picture, a preshifted shape, an 
Applesoft shape, or that new machine language routine you developed. 
Here are some that work well: 

.PIC for a standard format picture 

.PAC for a packed picture (.PAK in Lubar's format) 

.SSH for a preshifted shape 

.SHP for an Applesoft shape 

.FNT for a character set or text font 

You are encouraged to use the packer and unpacker routines to han- 
dle pictures in the .pac format. If lots of people use .pac as a second stan-

Magic Memory™ 
Will Remember Everything For You 



(If you want it to) 



Imagine a system that would record all 
the wonderous, valuable information 
you have assimilated onto a single tiny 
disk. (No more scattered bits of paper, 
business cards, etc.) Imagine the same 
system giving you a typed sheet you 
could put into a notebook or print out 
for a party and instantly change, or add 
to, at a moments notice. Imagine cross- 
referencing to suit both your business 
needs and personal desires so that all 
your data was organized into one little 
black book! On top of all this — imagine 
having fun putting it together. 



MAGIC MEMORY™ is built for the com- 
puter rookie. Everyone can relate to 
MAGIC MEMORY™ because its form is 
familiar. It looks like an address book 
but its not. Its more. Like the address 
book, MAGIC MEMORY™ presents an 
A thru Z index tabulation on the right 
edge of the video display. The user 
simply selects a tab and the book is 
opened to the proper page(s). A second 
set of tabs are available that can be 
labeled by the user (i.e.: companies one 
deals with, birthdays, lists, wines, 
shops, etc.) Yet MAGIC MEMORY™ is

— The Sayings of Confucius 



At the end of a West Coast Computer Faire, there are 
two questions on everybody's mind: Where is a good place 
to get a foot massage, and what was the big story of the 
Faire? 

This year the big story of the Faire is there was no big 
story. Early on, expectations ran high that there would be a 
showdown, because Apple and IBM were to have their own 
special halls. Everybody expected that the two personal 
computer heavyweights would come out fighting, exchanging 
punches at first and then getting down to some serious 
brawling. 

As it turned out, IBM had no particularly thrilling news 
to announce or products to unveil. Apple, on the other 
hand, had Lisa to show off. The holding back of major 
announcements and unveilings by the major manufacturers 
seemed to have infected the independent software and hard- 
ware vendors as well. 

Microcomputer Madness. Oh, sure, there was a new game 
here and a new hard disk there. Oh, sure, the booths were 
bigger and gaudier. There was even a walk-through booth 
(Perfect Software) that hinted of elaborate World's Fair-type 
displays; some attendees compared it to a ride at Disneyland, 
others were not so kind. 

But where were the robots? Apparently Nolan Bushnell's 
group Androbot applied for a booth too late. Where were 
the computer-controlled ultralights? Where was there any- 
thing more exciting than the usual hushed "come-over-here- 



and-listen-to-my-big-scheme' ' scene? 

Okay, perhaps we've been to too many of these affairs 
and can't see the forest for the trees. People who have re- 
cently become microcomputer owners no doubt found the 
Computer Faire an exciting event. With more than four hun- 
dred exhibitors — everyone from Abacus to Xcomp, display- 
ing everything from accessories to wire strippers — and forty- 
six thousand attendees, the Eighth West Coast Computer 
Faire was bigger than ever. 

In a way, it was very exciting to see the computer becom- 
ing a mundane object. It made it easier to accept the lack of 
exciting new products. Each year personal computers are 
reaching more people and becoming part of normal life. This 
Faire, if nothing else, proved that the world-at-large is more 
enthused than ever with microcomputers. 

Theory has it that if it rains the weekend of a computer 
show, the attendance increases by as much as 25 percent. 
Well, it was a gloomy, slippery, Chandleresque three days in 
the Bay Area. Along with the snails, worms, and other un- 
mentionables, the weather brought out the nerds. They 
crawled all over the luscious computer goodies and harassed 
the exhibitors with their sticky, annoying questions. 

At the same time, Fred and Ethel, Mr. Normal, Mutt 
and Jeff, and Lois Lane joined the inquisitive throng. A sig- 
nificant percentage of the attendees were not computer own- 
ers; they looked over the goods, not necessarily wearing their 
money belts, but curious and seriously considering a near- 
future purchase. 

They Came, They Wandered, They Left. Perhaps the big 
story at the Faire was who captured Captain Marvel, La- 
verne and Shirley, Han Solo, and Nancy Drew. Did they stay 
longer in IBM's hall or in Apple's? Did they ask questions or 
just pick up the literature? Did they look longer than two 
minutes at the Commodore? 

The size of this show, both in area and number of bodies,

was enough to wear out the most zealous consumer. While 
finicky nerds hassled beleaguered salespersons, discouraged 
novices were carried away in the flood. 

Basically, it was a mess — but a well-organized, sprawling, 
fun mess. There were magicians doing card tricks, robots 
blindly bumping into people, a funky dude dressed like a 
caveman, and at least one stripper. Sure, there was a lot of 
serious business being done, but not so much so that people 
were glum about it. 

Okay, enough of the big story and on to the products. A 
lot has changed in two years. Though there were few new 
offerings, most of the products on display, old and new, 
boasted a standard of excellence that would have floored an 
attendee at the Sixth West Coast Computer Faire. Last year's 
amateurs were this year's professionals, while the newer com- 
panies strove to make the best impression possible. 

Ei-En Enterprise Company of Tokyo, Japan, displayed a 
streamlined disk drive that is half the height (forty-one milli- 
meters) of conventional drives. It has a track-to-track time of 
three to six microseconds, compared to about forty micro- 
seconds on most standard models. 

Micron Technology of Boise, Idaho, showed off its 
Micron Eye Bullet, a solid-state digital imaging system capa- 
ble of transmitting up to fifteen frames per second and with 
128-by-256 element resolution. It is compatible with the 
Apple II and smartly designed. 

A Knee-High Mechanical Drunk. RB Robot Corporation 
of Golden, Colorado, had a big hit with its RB5X "intelli- 
gent robot," a miniature R2D2 equipped with tactile sensors. 
The robot is fully programmable with an Apple computer 
and will soon have accessories, and was the only robot to be 
found other than Heath's Hero I. RB5X at least had a 
chance to run around blindly on the floor and bump into 
total strangers. At Heath's booth, a couple of Hero I's were 
mounted on pedestals with nowhere to go. 



Broderbund got into the Faire spirit and revealed several 
new games, including Lode Runner, Gumball, and Spare 
Change. TG Products's selectable joystick was impressive. 
Epson had its FX-80, which boasts a 160-characters-per- 
second mode along with the 80-characters-per-second "quiet 
mode." The MX-80 has only the slower speed. 

Nexa is a new game company. Their line of strategy 
games for the Apple marks the first game venture to require 
64K. This is a courageous move from a new company. Many 
companies have voiced an interest in writing games requiring 
64K but have balked because the standard Apple has 48K. 
Bravo, Nexa! 

Penguin Software sneak-previewed an early version of the 
sequel to its arcade thriller, Spy's Demise. Island Graphics 
showed off its new graphics paint system, The Illustrator. 

Edu-Ware and Sweet Micro Systems called a special press 
conference to announce a joint venture in developing a bio- 
feedback mouse to use with compatible games. The device 
will monitor pulse rate, galvanic skin response, and skin tem- 
perature, and will interface with software that will affect the 
play of the game according to user excitement and anxiety 
levels. If your pulse is high, for instance, the game will play 
faster. The product will be available later in the year. 

Twenty-five magazine and newspaper writers covering 
personal computers got together and discussed methods to 
improve communication among technology writers and the 
possibility of setting up an organization. An agreement was 
made to hold a second meeting at the upcoming National 
Computer Conference in May. A tentative name was set for 
the group, "Computer Writers of America." Originality is 
clearly not a prerequisite for membership. 

Microsoft, which did not have a booth, threw a well- 
attended bash at San Francisco's Flood Mansion. Industry 
insiders mingled and enjoyed a terrific selection of food. 
There were other parties and informal get-togethers through-

out the weekend. 

At the end of the second day of the Eighth West Coast 
Computer Faire, Softalk held its third annual awards cere- 
mony. 

For the past two years Softalk has handed out the Most 
Popular Program of the Year award, as voted by the readers 
of the magazine. The first winner was Super Invader, the fol- 
lowing year, Raster Blaster took the kudos. This year, the 
awards were expanded to include the Most Popular Program 
of 1982 for the Apple III and the Most Popular Program of 
All Time for the Apple II. Also getting into the act were 
Softalk Publishing's other magazines: Softalk for the IBM 
Personal Computer presented an award for the Most Popu- 
lar Program for the IBM pc, and Softline, having drawn on 
the opinion of its second-largest readership, presented an 
award for the Most Popular Program on the Atari. 

Emceeing and making the presentation of the Most Popu- 
lar Program of 1982 for the Apple II award was Softalk ed- 
itor Margot Comstock Tommervik. Gary Carlston and Dan 
Gorlin accepted awards for Choplifter as publisher and 
author. Gorlin, whose wife had awarded him a baby girl ear- 
lier that week, was speechless; Carlston said that when Bro- 
derbund first saw the game, "It was just a helicopter landing 
in pink mud." But what a helicopter. 

Softalk's, managing editor Pat Ryall made the presenta- 
tion of the Most Popular Program of 1982 for the Apple III. 
The winner was VisiCalc: Advanced Version. Software engi- 
neer Tim Walters of Software Arts accepted the program- 
mer's plaque and VisiCorp chairman Dan Fylstra accepted 
for the publisher. 

Tommervik also made the presentation of the Most Pop- 
ular Program of All Time. Sir-tech's role-playing fantasy 
Wizardry ran away with the honor. Amazingly, Wizardry 
pulled more than twice the votes of the runner-up, VisiCalc. 



Fred, Norman, and Robert Sirotek accepted the publisher's 
award for Wizardry. The program's authors, Andrew Green- 
berg and Robert Woodhead, were also on hand to accept 
their awards. 

Referring to the award, a beaming Woodhead said, "This 
is the first time we've agreed about something without ar- 
guing." Greenberg, from the sidelines, quickly replied, "No, 
it isn't." 

Softline coeditor Andrew Christie presented the Most 
Popular Atari Program award, as voted by the Atari readers 
of Softline. The winner was Atari's own war-horse Star 
Raiders; accepting for the publisher was A.J. Sekel, manager 
of press relations for Atari. 

Craig Stinson, editor of Softalk for the IBM Personal 
Computer, presented that magazine's first Most Popular Pro- 
gram award. The readers chose VisiCalc by a wide margin. 
Accepting for Software Arts was product manager Lisa Un- 
derkoffler. Founder and chairman of the board Dan Fylstra 
accepted his second of the day for VisiCorp. 

Softalk will be on hand at the next West Coast Computer 
Faire to hold its fourth awards ceremony. 

Same Time Next Year. When it was all over and the halls 
were cleared of straggling nerds, the exhibitors swept up the 
merchandise and left in a hurry. Space orders for next year's 
Ninth West Coast Computer Faire were being taken through- 
out the weekend, and by the end of the show almost 85 per- 
cent of the exhibit space had been booked. Next year a new 
hall will be added, bringing the total number of exhibits up 
to one thousand. 

Ten months from now it will happen all over again; the 
fiower of the microcomputer industry will strut its stuff. It'll 
be even bigger and noisier than this year's. Even at its most 
mundane, the West Coast Computer Faire is still not an 
event to be missed. HI

YOU'LL NEVER TOUCH A 
"NAKED" COMPUTER AGAM 




A "naked" computer is any computer that sits on a bare table or desl< top, 
without a TouchMaf" brand static dissipative table mat directly under it. 

"NAKED" COMPUTERS ARE VULNERABLE 

to some of the most frustrating static-related problems a computer user 
can encounter— erratic or erroneous data transmission, loss of programs 
or data, damage to discs or accessory cards, component failure, or 
"unexplained" down time. 

During the dry winter heating season, you are probably more aware of 
static electricity because you can feel it. However, your computer is 
vulnerable to a much smaller ZAP than you can possibly feel, and that 
level of static may occur at any time of the year. Even air conditioning can 
aggravate the problem by drying the air. 

ONLY TAKES ONE ZAP 

'to make your perfectly logical computer act irrational and temperamental. 

rienced computer usersknow that static electricity cannot be 
completely eliminated frora^e environment or the microcomputer, since 
people are prime geneiplDrs of static. The best solution is to channel static 
charges harmlessly aV^y before they have a chance t9 spark to sensitive 
components and accessories.

Discharging takes less than a second, does not produce a spark, and is 
absolutely assured by the simple fact that your skin contacts the mat 
directly. (The sweat layer of the human skin is a primary conductor of 
electricity.) Anytime your hands or wrists rest on the mat, static discharge 
is automatic. 

A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT OVER 
CONDUCTIVE FLOOR MATS, 

the TouchMaf" does not require users to wear leather-soled shoes for ef- 
fective static discharge. A floor mat may be rendered virtually ineffective by 
today's popular synthetic and rubber-soled shoes, which insulate the user. 

THE BEST THING NEXT TO YOUR COMPUTER, 

the cushioning material of the TouchMat™ also serves to dampen noise 
and vibration, and prevents your computer from sliding around on the 
desktop. Available in a computer-compatible beige, 24" x 26", it 
accommodates all popular micros.

i Government and Industry 

Get Serious about the Competition 



It appears the U.S. government and the 
electronics industry are finally getting seri- 
ous about the FCC — The Foreign Computer 
ChaDenge. 

The Reagan administration's proposed 
1984 budget, which earmarks a whopping 
$45.8 billion to military and civilian R&D 
programs, includes one major computer 
goody — a national high-tech lab at Berkeley, 
California. At the same time, a congressional 
bill asking for upward of $400 million for up- 
grading math and science education in U.S. 
schools is gaining favor in the House of Rep- 
resentatives. 

Fifteen blue-chip computer companies are 
also putting their money where their future is. 
They have banded together to form MCTC, 
the Microelectronics and Computer Technol- 
ogy Corporation. The consortium plans to 
spend between $50 and $100 million a year on 
R&D projects that individual companies 
would not or could not undertake by them- 
selves. MCTC will initiate four R&D proj- 



ects: designing a fifth generation computer; 
improving software design, with the develop- 
ment of techniques, procedures, and tools us- 
ing expert and knowledge-based systems; ad- 
vancing computer-aided design and manufac- 
ture; and developing new ways to package 
chips to increase design efficiencies. 

Founding shareholders of MCTC read 
like a Who's Who in computers and elec- 
tronics. They are Advanced Micro Devices, 
Control Data Corporation, Digital Equip- 
ment Corporation, Harris Corporation, 
Honeywell, Motorola, NCR Corporation, 
National Semiconductor, RCA, Sperry, Mos- 
tek Corporation, Xerox, Signetics, and West- 
inghouse Electronics. 

"Most journalists tend to view this as our 
response to the Japanese threat," says William 
Shaffer of Control Data, an MCTC interim 
spokesman. "But there's an MCTC-like or- 
ganization within the European Common 
Market called Esprit. They're coming from 
the back of the pack, the Europeans, but 



they're moving very rapidly." Apparendy, the 
Far East is not the only competition worth 
keeping an eye on. 

The MCTC, which will be headed by re- 
tired admiral Bobby R. Inman, hopes to be up 
and running by 1984. It is currently evaluat- 
ing thirty-six sites for the organization's facili- 
ties. "There could be as many as five sites and 
as few as one," says Shaffer. "With four pro- 
grams and headquarters personnel, it may 
make sense to colocate one or more at a single 
location." 

Site reviewers are weighing a number of 
factors, including an area's university and 
high-tech industry base, vendor/supplier rela- 
tionships, quality of life, ready access by air, 
and boilerplate economics (taxes, real estate 
and housing costs). The review process should 
be completed by late spring, Shaffer says. 

Site selection may be the least of MCTC's 
problems, however. "A cloud of uncertainty" 
hangs over the project, according to Control 
Data President Robert M. Price, due to con- 
fusion over federal and antitrust policy. 
MCTC shareholders would like to see Con- 
gress amend the law to permit R&D ventures 
such as theirs. The U.S. Justice Department 
did not block the formation of the company 
but has said it reserves the option to file an 
antitrust action in the future, a position that 
has led some twenty-five companies that are 
reportedly interested in joining MCTC to balk 
at committing themselves.

Artificial Intelligence 
Research Advances 



There are two schools of thought on the 
development of thinking machines. The arti- 
ficial intelligence engineers ask, Why not de- 
velop mental tools, just as we develop physi- 
cal tools, to help us accomplish things? The ar- 
tificial intelligence jdewn'jrj ask, Why don't we 
try to understand what intelligence is about? 
Not just to make thinking machines, but to 
develop programs that behave intelligently, to 
understand better how the mind of man 
works. 

The more popular engineering school 
wants to replace the mind with a machine that 
does the job better. The scientific school, in 
the minority, wants to explore the mind with a 
machine. So the scientific school is breaking 
down the mental process of discovery into 
programming attempts at re-creating the logic 
of the mind. 

One of these programs is Wok, a research 
project at Yale University. When a dish re- 
quires an ingredient not on hand, such as 
chicken. Wok juggles ingredients and spices 
just the way an enterprising chef would to 
come up with an alternative, such as pork. Re- 
searchers say some of Wok's concoctions 
"don't taste too bad." 

Another program, called Bacon, is a time- 
sharing mainframe project at Carnegie-Mel- 
lon University in Pittsburgh, Ffennsylvania, 
under the supervision of Herbert Simon, a 
pioneer in artificial intelligence research. Si- 
mon contends that we don't know enough 
about the human thinking process to repli- 
cate it yet. 

"We're still very far from having any sin- 
gle program that has the range of knowledge 
that a normal human being would carry 
around," he says. 

Bacon demonstrates human-style creativi- 
ty and problem-solving. If given the basic in- 
formation available to the astronomer Jo- 




hannes Kepler, Bacon can come up with Kep- 
ler's Third Law, which relates the distance be- 
tween a planet and a sun to the time it takes 
the planet to orbit the sun. It can also sift 
through data and discover Ohm's law, which 
defines the relationship between resistance, 
voltage, and current in a circuit. 

Written in Lisp, because the language 
deals with symbols as well as numbers. Bacon 
isn't intended to replicate what other people 
have discovered. Researchers use it to look for 
heuristics or rules of thumb in the relation- 
ships between numeric variables. Heuristics 
detect regularities in numeric and nominal 
data and, by noting constancies and trends, 
cause Bacon to formulate hypotheses, define 
theoretical terms, and propose integral rela- 
tions (common devisers) among quantities. 

"Bacon doesn't have a picture in its mind," 
says Patrick Langeley, a grad student on the 
project. "But it can come up with a concept." 
Langeley did his thesis on the program. "We 
want to find the law that summarizes the given 
data, and we direct the search down specific 
paths," until a total comprehension of the 
input is reached by the program. 

Another program developed at Yale 
mimics the knowledge of former secretary of 
state Cyrus Vance. When Cyrus was asked, 
"When did your wife meet Begin's wife?" it re- 
plied, "At a state dinner in Israel in January 
1980." 

Cyrus's answer is historically correct. 
What makes it significant is that Cyrus was 
not programmed with information on wives, 
only on state dinners. According to Dr. Janet 
Kolodner, who developed the program, it 
went through a multistep reasoning process to 
come up with the answer. First it determined 
that the women would have met at a social 
event, then it decided the event would have to

Music, Technology, and Careers 
Will Be Thrust of '83 Us Festival 



The 1983 Us Festival returns to Glen 
Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino, Cali- 
fornia, on May 28-30 and June 4. 

Once again music is taking the media spot- 
light; Unuson has announced a strong lineup 
of new wave and heavy metal/rock bands for 
the first three days, and a solid day of cotintry 
western music acts is scheduled for June 4. 
Nonetheless, Unuson and Wozniak have 
made clear that this year's technology fair will 
be bigger and better than last year's. 

Plans call for an expanded technology 
expo that includes information on career op- 
portunities in technological fields. Wozniak 
himself is in charge of this portion of the '83 
Us Festival, lining up representatives from dif- 
ferent corporations to speak at the three- 
day fest. 

Unuson was a little fuzzy on whether the 
technology and career expo will continue dur- 
ing the June 4th country music day. A deci- 
sion had not been made by press time. 

This year's technology fair will feature a 
tent devoted to showcasing organizations that 
embody the Us Decade philosophies of 
"teamwork and pulling together." Neighbor- 
hood Watch and similar community-minded 
groups are good examples. Unuson is trying 
to get the National Association of Broadcast- 
ers involved in the project. 

The Us Network (see November 1982 Sof- 
talk, page 63) may not be together in time for 
the broadcasting of this year's Us Festival 
proceedings. "Progress has been made," said a 
Unuson official, "but there's no definite an- 
swer yet as to whether or not we'll be broad- 
casting the concerts, though we've been work- 
ing toward that." 

Unuson is hoping to have another two- 
way television transmission between the U.S. 
and the U.S.S.R. "We're talking with them 
and they're interested, but nothing has been 
solidified," said a Unuson official. A two-way 
transmission with the People's Republic of 
China is also possible, but has not yet been 
confirmed. At least Bill Graham won't be 
around to complain. 

According to Unuson, ticket sales through 



the mail and at various outlets have been very 
strong. The lineup of performers is as good if 
not better than that of the first festival. 

The first day, Saturday, May 28, show- 
cases critically acclaimed English group The 
Clash, followed by Men at Work, Stray Cats, 
The English Beat, A Flock of Seagulls, Oingo 
Boingo, Wall of Voodoo, Divynals, and Lit- 
tle Steven and the Disciples of Soul. 

Heavy metal dominates Sunday, May 
29, with loud and rowdy headliner Van 
Halen. Scorpions, Triumph, Judas Priest, 
Ozzy Osborne, Joe Walsh, and Motley Crew 
will also be appearing that day. 

The big surprise of the festival is David 
Bowie, who headlines the final night of the 
three-day rock festival. Bowie has not per- 
formed in the United States in more than six 
years and, given the size of the Us Festival 
stage and Bowie's reputation as a performer, 
it should be quite a show. The rest of the day's 
performers include The Pretenders, Stevie 
Nicks, John Cougar, Missing Persons, Quar- 
ter Rash, U2, and Berlin. 

The June 4th country music day boasts 
Willie Nelson as the headliner, along with 
Alabama, Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams, 
Jr., Emmylou Harris, Ricky Skaggs, Riders in 
the Sky, and the Thrasher Brothers. 

Wozniak and Unuson are hoping for 
more than a million fans over the combined 
four days. The booking of bands, handled by 
Barry Fey, indicates that Unuson is hoping to 
draw a different crowd each day. To en- 
courage this, only one-day tickets for twenty 
dollars each are being sold. This time it'll cost 
sixty dollars to attend all three days, as op- 
posed to last year when three-day tickets were 
sold for thirty-nine dollars. 

Those attending more than one day and 
using the adjoining campsites will be charged 
a nominal parking fee. The camping area 
will open at 8:00 p.m. on Friday, May 27. The 
next three days the schedule will be the same, 
the festival area gates opening at 8:00 a.m., 
with the career and technology expo opening 
at 10:00 a.m. The music on all three days will 
start at noon. DH

In our rapidly evolving information socie- 
ty, some psychologists think that people are 
less inhibited in giving information to a com- 
puter than to a psychologist. 

Dr. J. Fred Hurst, of Boise, Idaho, has 
been using the Psychometer 3000 (designed for 
use in the behavioral sciences) for a year now. 
Hurst says he chose this system mainly for its 
versatility, adding that the computer saves 
both the clinician and the patient time and 
money. 

A variety of psychological tests come on 
disk with the Psychometer 3000. The comput- 
er administers, scores, and interprets the tests. 
It also prints out test results, including case 
interpretations. 

The patient interacts directly with the 
computer. Since the computer's keyboard is 
designed for very simple patient responses 
such as yes, no, don't know, and help, any 
conceivable confusion and complexity that 
might be encountered with the usual comput- 
er keyboard is eliminated. 

The Psychometer compares the patient's 
answers to those given in thousands of other 
cases, faster and more accurately than a hu- 
man, before making its analysis. There is less 
chance of biased results, according to Hurst. 

"However," Hurst admits, "whenever a 
human interpretation is made, even of num- 
bers, we still will have some subjective input. 
We want to minimize that subjective input so 
that our interpretation of test results is as ob- 
jective as humanly possible. 

"Reliability is the most expensive thing we 
have to deal with, and that's what we strive 
for," Hurst explains. "A computer helps us 
achieve that more rapidly, and in a much 
more objective way." 

Although the computer can do some of 
the same work previously done by the psy- 
chologist. Hurst stresses that this machine in 
no way lessens the importance of the cli- 
nician. By relieving the psychologist of the 
tedious, time-consuming tasks of administer- 
ing tests and generating attendant paper- 
work, the computer allows more time for ere- 



Psychology 

in 
the 

Computer 
Age 

ative human interaction with the patient. Ac- 
cording to Hurst, before a computer was used, 
the preparation of test results alone took 
about four hours. Now, with the aid of the 
Psychometer 3000, test results are analyzed 
and ready for use in about ten minutes. 

Included with Hurst's Psychometer 3000 
system are a printer, psychological testing 
software, and software for word processing 
and billing. His package also includes an op- 
tional keyboard for programming and a re- 
mote portable assessment terminal (PAT). 

The PAT 100, about the size of a back- 



251 

gammon game and weighing about two 
pounds, is easily transported, thereby en- 
abling Hurst to make "house calls." The port- 
able unit stores data from five to ten standard 
psychological tests. Test data can then be 
easily transferred by modem to the main com- 
puter for processing. 

Hurst says that the computerized testing 
through the portable terminal is also helpful in 
preparing for court cases. It enables him to 
conduct tests immediately prior to giving 
courtroom testimony, thereby presenting the 
most recent data possible. 

In reference to computers being used in 
the field of psychology, Hurst says, "There are 
new tests being programmed for this particu- 
lar unit, and I think that this whole comput- 
erized psychological testing approach is going 
to expand. How far is limited only by the 
imagination." 

Dr. Thomas McDonald, a psychologist at 
Transition Associates in San Diego, Califor- 
nia, agrees that computers are starting to play 
an important role in the behavioral sciences. 
However, McDonald feels that they could 
play a much bigger part if given the oppor- 
tunity. 

"We need to get more accustomed to us- 
ing them instead of being threatened by 
them," says McDonald. "Working with com- 
puters is a partnership, and we professionals 
are the ones who are falling short, not the 
computers. Once we realize that they are only 
tools, I think they will be used on a much 
wider scale in the field of psychology." MS

Short Film Stars 
Industrial Robots 
on the Assembly Line 

Roll over, Tchaikovsky. 

The makers of Ballet Robotique say their 
film is a short, space-age fantasy, "strictly a 
work of entertainment," as opposed to just 
another "industrial film." Directed by Bob 
Rogers, photographed by Reed Smoot, and 
made possible by a grant from GM, Ballet 
Robotique is a tasty gem, a zesty romp 
through a half dozen assembly plants across 
the country. It's eight minutes of graceful 
spray painting, dynamic die-casting, and war- 
like welding, starring the big boys, heavy- 
weight industrial robots. 

Nominated for an Academy Award in the 
Live Action Short Film category, Ballet Ro- 
botique is a well-crafted film that attempts to 
present industrial robots as something more 
than dumb machines and something less than 
R2D2 and C3P0. The film-makers have used 
evocative lighting and clever editing to endow 
the robots with personalities of a sort, in much 
the same way cartoons and animated films 
treat animals as almost human. 

Ballet Robotique features more than a 
dozen different industrial robots performing 
their normal tasks; no special reprogramming 
was done for the film. Shooting in real auto 
plants, the film-makers had some control over 
the atmosphere, but interrupting normal op- 
erations on an assembly line was out of the 
question — too expensive (around six thou- 
sand dollars per minute). 

Still, the precise movements of the robots 
are tailor-made for synchronized editing to 
classical music, in this case Bizet, Delibes, and 
Tchaikovsky. When you watch the film, it 
seems as though the robots had to have been 
controlled by the film-makers, but such is the 
magic of the cinema. The subtle color schemes 
and murky atmosphere of the film were often 




manipulated by Rogers and Smoot for a de- 
sired effect — cinema magic of a different kind. 

The result is great fun. "In the dark abyss, 
deep blue swirls of smoke curl up from the 
depths below," said Rogers in a recent Ameri- 
can Cinematographer article on the making of 
Ballet Robotique. "An eerie red glow eman- 
ates from within the blackness. Suddenly, the 
gleaming silver arms of the robots rear up and 
plunge forward, shooting sparks that leap and 
pirouette in arcs of fire. Spitting sparks, 
breathing smoke, they crackle as they plunge 
again and again to attack." 

Ballet Robotique climaxes with huge wdd- 
ing robots sending showers of sparks flying in 
time with Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. 
Rogers and Smoot tried to make it look like a 
laser battle in outer space. 

Your chances of seeing this film in a local 
theater are slim at best. Even with an Acad- 
emy Award nomination. Ballet Robotique is 
one of countless short films you always hear 
about and never see. It deserves wider expo- 
sure. Currently, Ballet Robotique is being dis- 
tributed by Pyramid Film & Video of Santa 
Monica, California. You can purchase or rent 
a 16mm print or videocassette of the film at a 
reasonable price. 

Those interested in robots, whether their 
jobs are threatened by one or not, will dis- 
cover that Ballet Robotique is definitely not a 
"typical industrial film." DH

Computers and Villains-Looking 
at the Lineup of Summer Movies 



Last summer moviegoers were treated to 
several Hollywood films that either were pro- 
duced with the aid of computers or featured 
computers in the story. 

Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan featured 
gorgeous computer-generated graphics cre- 
ated by George Lucas's special effects firm, In- 
dustrial Light and Magic. Blade Runner also 
had fantastically intricate and beautiful ef- 
fects, and its high-tech subject matter made 
the film thought-provoking on a number of 
levels. 

Tron tried harder than any other film to 
bring computers into films and the film-mak- 
ing process. Unfortunately, Tron did not clean 
up at the box office as predicted, creating 
some doubt in the minds of Hollywood pro- 




ducers as to the true drawing power of the 
subject matter and the method. With its weak 
script and weak or nonexistent characters, 
Tron was simply a special effects showpiece, 
and it's not surprising that audiences stayed 
away. Up against such tough competition as 
E.T. and Rocky III, Tron needed more than 
just great special effects to be a success. 

On the lighter side of last summer's high- 
tech movies was The Thing. Early on in the 
fikn, an exasperated Kurt Russell pours a 
glass of Jack Daniels and ice into an elec- 
tronic chess game. Audiences generally liked 
that scene, but not much else in this chilling, 
bleak look at a less-than-angelic alien that lit- 
erally absorbs its victims. (E.T., phone the 
Marines!) 

In the summer of 1983, a number of com- 
puter-generated and computer-related films 
will grace the silver screen. None of these films 
will help you relocate DOS, or even tell you 
the differoice between a Cray-1 and an Otrona 
Attache. But if you're into the summer movie 
scene, here are some flicks to be on the look- 



out for. 

Blue Thunder, from Columbia, stars Roy 
Scheider as a Vietnam vet and helicopter ace 
hired by the Los Angeles Police Department 
to thwart terrorism during the 1984 Olym- 
pics. A secret government agency equips 
Scheider with Blue Thunder, a supercopter 
equipped with the latest in computer surveil- 
lance technology. Scheider can eavesdrop elec- 
tronically or use a thermographic scope to 
look through walls. If necessary, the helicop- 
ter can fire four thousand rounds per minute 
or resort to its six 20mm cannons. Not sur- 
prisingly, Scheider ends up battling the gov- 
ernment, not terrorists. 

Superman III, from Warner's, once again 
finds Christopher Reeve portraying the Man 
of Steel. This time around he falls for Lana 
Lang (Annette O'Toole) and battles a master 
criminal (Robert Vaughn) who has enlisted 
computer genius Richard Pryor in a plot to 
acquire immeasurable wealth and power. 
Much of the film's action occurs in Vaughn's 
hideout, dubbed the Computer Cave. Super- 
man eventually comes up against the Ulti- 
mate Computer, which tries to trap him with 
an energy web, among other things. 

Android is a low-budget effort starring 
Klaus Kinski as a slightly loony scientist. 



253 

Kinski's experiments with sophisticated 
robots attract the nefarious attention of inter- 
galactic convicts. It's played mainly for 
laughs. 

Joysticks, from Jenson Farley Pictures, is a 
youth comedy focusing on the antics of a 
group of kids who frequent a video arcade. 
The tag line reads, "Every teenager's fantasy 
come true." The promotional material shows 
two scantily clad, buxom beach babes lean- 
ing over an arcade game. This one is ques- 
tionable at best. 

Tin Man stars Timothy Bottoms, Deana 
Jurgens, and "Osgood" the computer. The ad 
line for this one reads, "His world was silent. 
His love was computers. . . . Until he met 
her." 

Crosstalk is an Australian film that focuses 
on a man who develops a supercomputer 
when he is confined to his apartment by an ac- 
cident. Mysteriously, his work leads him into 
a vortex of murder and technological horror. 

Films that will most likely include com- 
puter-generated effects are Return of the Jedi 
(Fox), Something Wicked This Way Comes 
(Disney), Twilight Zone (Warner's), and Space 
Hunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone {Co- 
lumbia), the latter filmed in 3-D. There's a 
good chance that both James Bond films, Oc- 
topussy (MGM-UA) and Never Say Never 
Again (Warner's), will have computers in- 
volved in the action. 

Computer-related films to look for toward 
the end of the year include The Right Stuff

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ? ? ? 



Are you tired of waiting for DOS to 
load and save files? Are you tired of 
waiting for DOS to finlsfi so you can 
type again? Are you tired of waiting 
for your printer? When you buy 
Diversl-DOS^", you won't have to 
wait any more! Here's why: 

1. DOS speed-up: Apple DOS 3.3 
takes 18 disk revolutions to read a 
single track, whereas Diversi-DOS 
reads or writes a track in just 2 
revolutions. This speeds up file pro- 
cessing tremendously (see table). 

2. Keyboard Buffer: DIversi-DOS 

allows you to type at any time, as 
fast as you can, without missing a 
single character.

Network TV is also getting into the com- 
puter scene. Look for an as-yet-untitled pilot 
from Paramount about a couple of guys in the 
computer biz. One of them is a nerd who cre- 
ates new concepts. Paramount Television 
president Gary Nardino says, "It's like a Mar- 
tin and Lewis relationship but much warmer." 

Also, CBS is planning a pilot, and hoping 



to do a series called Whiz Kids. The pilot cen- 
ters on "young computer geniuses," one of 
whom finds out how to use his personal com- 
puter to gain access to a large computer con- 
taining the transactions of an influential land 
developer. Something looks suspicious to the 
young hacker and the game is afoot. 

Looking ahead to the high-tech-movie 
scene in the summer of '84, get ready for 
Dune, with an all-star cast, Supergirl, Indiana 
Jones and the Temple of Death (nicknamed 
Indy 2), and its clone, Marauders of the Crim- 
son Orb. The third Star Trek movie should be 
out as well. And, judging by its intriguing ti- 
tle, Siliclone should rely heavily on computers 
for its plot machinations. 

That's all, folks! DH

US. Strikes Back 



continued from page 247 

R&D budget and the relative lack of Con- 
gressional opposition to it suggests that 
MCTC supporters may find Capitol Hill re- 
ceptive to sjjecial legislation. In Washington 
these days, high-tech is in. "Whether you 
agree or disagree with the President's view of 
the world," Caltech economist Roger G. Noll 
told the Los Angeles Times, "the fact is that 
this budget document — unlike his first two — 
is a national pursuit of rational objectives." 

The rational objective that has emerged re- 
flects growing national commitment to high 
technology. Government and industry have 
worked together before — to build the rail- 
roads and put a man on the moon — and such 
cooperation is demanded now to match simi- 
lar efforts by the Japanese and the Euro- 
peans, many experts believe. 

Eugene Haller of the Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory notes that the U.S. hasn't been as 
quick as other countries to recognize the close 
connection between basic research and indus- 
trial applications. "We've tended to make 
breakthroughs in the laboratory and then left 
it up to industry to make use of it," he told the 
Los Angeles Times. "And what we've noticed 
is that the Japanese and Germans have been a 
lot quicker to jump on things than our fellow 
Americans." 

Jumping on things in the future is going to 
take more than a garage in Silicon Valley. It 
will require prodigious commitments in 
money and personnel and call for creative and 
efficient means of organizing research efforts. 

"The United States has tough antitrust 
laws that in the past have served to stifle co- 
operation between companies in research," 
observes Philip H. Abelson, the editor of 
Science. "In consequence, there is a tremen- 
dous waste of scarce resources of people and 
excessive duplication of effort in our indus- 
trial research. Companies often must redis- 
cover the same phenomena. 

"The Bell System and IBM are sufficient- 
ly big and entrenched that they are secure for 
at least a while. But smaller companies such as 
those in MCTC are unlikely to prosper in the 
longer term if they must go it alone." JM

to develop a world-affairs-expert program ca- 
pable of offering political advice. 

Computers can manipulate artificial struc- 
tures just as people can. No problem. The 
challenge in artificial intelligence projects like 
Wok, Bacon, and Cyrus is in designing a sys- 
tem of common sense that both computers 
and human beings can use. MP

□ But Can It Chew Gum at the Same 
Time? A month and a half ago, a small Ana- 
heim, California-based company revealed a 
spectacular robot called the Odex I. Odetics 
spent two years developing what it calls a 
"fiinctionoid," a stx-l^ged, walking robot. The 
idea was conceived eight years ago, and in- 
deed the challenge of building a walking ro- 
bot has beckoned to roboticists for longer 
than that. Odex I is a truly revolutionary 
breakthrough in robot development, and it's 
not surprising in the still-young robot indus- 
try that a small company like Odetics was the 
one to realize it. Odex I is capable of six basic 
positions: tucked, tall, squat, normal, low pro- 




file, and narrow. The accompanying picture 
shows the Odex I in the normal, wide articu- 
lated position. With its six "articulators," 
Odex I can traverse over any terrain, ma- 
neuver through environments designed for hu- 
man movement, climb up and over obstacles, 
support weights far greater than its own, and 
assume a number of different "profiles." The 
Odex I weighs 370 pounds and can carry a 
maximum of 1 ,000 pounds at its fastest speed 
and 1,800 pounds at its slowest. In its initial 
showing, Odex I climbed into the back of a 
pickup truck, climbed out again, and then 
picked up the back end of the truck and 
dragged it across the showroom. Odex I can

□ Not Just a Mickey Mouse Affair. The 

annual National Computer Conference 
(NCC) will be held in Anaheim May 16-19 at 
the Anaheim and Disneyland Hotel conven- 
tion centers. This massive show features ex- 
hibits of computer products and services, tech- 
nical sessions, seminars, and formal ad- 
dresses. The keynote address will be given at 
9:30 a.m. on May 16 by John P. Imlay of 
Management Science America. The admis- 
sion: $40 per day or $100 for all four days. 
The exhibits will be open from 10:00 a.m. to

a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on the final day. 



□ Step in, Gose Your Eyes, Kick Back, and 
Unwind. Stress in the working environment, 
particularly the modern office environment, is 
a problem that Environ of El Toro, Califor- 
nia, is attempting to alleviate with a micro- 
processor-controlled telephone-boothlike con- 
traption. Called an Environ Personal Retreat, 
the pale, smokestack -shaped, soundproof en- 
closure is ninety-two inches high, seventy- 
seven inches long, and forty-eight inches wide. 
The retreat is equipped with a low-friction 
sliding door, exterior and interior graphics (no 
video or CRT screen, though) with optional 
color treatments, a ceiling-mounted color gen-

product by midyear. 

□ Welcome to the Hotel Videotex. Travel- 
host, based in Dallas, Texas, is bringing video- 
tex technology to hotels around the country. 
Using a Travelhost terminal and a television 
set, hotel guests can send and receive elec- 
tronic mail, shop, call up news and stock quo- 
tations, check airline schedules, and — you

has a membrane touch-panel keyboard, a 
built-in 300-baud modem, and is capable of 
creating a forty-character-by-twenty-four-line 
color or black-and-white display on a VHP 
channel. Selected Hiltons, Sheratons, Holiday 
Inns, Howard Johnson's, and Ramada Inns 
have signed contracts with Travelhost. 
□ How To Avoid the Can't-Find-the-Mov- 
ie-Section Blues. A free videotex service 
called Buy-Phone has started up in West Los 
Angeles, California. Using standard 300-baud 
ASCII communications, personal computer 
users can access more than ten thousand list- 




ings covering all kinds of consumer products, 
services, and entertainment. A user wanting to 
see a particular motion picture, for example, 
calls up Buy-Phone and the various theater lo- 
cations are displayed in order of their dis- 
tance from the user. Within Buy-Phone's 
database are more than sixteen hundred res- 
taurants, indexed by their nationality, ambi- 
ance, entertainment, and other features. Cur- 



rently op)erational only in West Los Angeles, 
Buy-Phone has plans to expand into other 
areas soon. Buy-Phone can be reached by 
modem at (213) 474-0270. 

□ Tubular Computer Shopping Malls. The 
computer industry will soon have its own ver- 
sion of the merchandise marts — industry mar- 
kets found in cities like Chicago and Dallas. 
Both the Pacific High Technology Trade Cen- 
ter and the California DataMart will be lo- 
cated in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Pa- 
cific center will be a four-hundred-thousand- 
square foot computer "shopping mall," ac- 
cording to developer Ron Kaufman. The Cal- 
ifornia DataMart will be located next to 
Showplace Square, a merchandise mart in San 
Francisco, and will start out occupying one 
hundred fifty thousand square feet with the 
option to expand to about five hundred thou- 
sand square feet. DataM art's developers, Bay 
West Development Company and Metropol- 
itan Properties, project the cost for the small 
business computer mart to be $19 million. 

□ The Rumormonger Ruminates. Does 
Luke Skywalker die? Is Princess Leia the 
"other"? Will the Jedi really fail to get their re- 
venge on the evil empire? These and other 
questions will finally be answered on May 25, 
when The Return of the Jedi opens nation- 
wide. . . . The details are sketchy, but in- 
formed sources have it that the upcoming Pete 
Shelley album, XXI, is coded in computer lan- 
guage so that lyrics will appear when listeners 
play the record hooked up to a video screen. 
. . . Stanley Kubrick is looking to make an- 
other science-fiction film, his first since 2001: A 
Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. 
Rumor has it that Kubrick is collaborating 
with England's most popular SF writer, Brian 
W. Aldiss, on an expanded feature-length 
screenplay of Aldiss's short story "Supertoys 
Last All Summer Long." 

□ New Mag for Computers on the Move. 
Miller Freeman Publications (San Francisco, 
CA) is offering a new computer magazine. 
Portable Computer. The name says it all. The 
premier issue had a listing of all the known 
portable computers currently available (about 
forty), as well as an interview with Adam Os- 
borne, an article on how to make your Apple 
even more portable than it already is, and the 
usual news, tips, and advertising. The 
April/May issue of Portable Computer fea- 
tures articles on portables in the school, net- 
working with portables, and portable 
terminals. DH Hi

They poked sport at me. They came to look, 
to gawk at me, and their humiUty had 
vanished. Where once I was viewed with 
reverence, as well as with a certain amount 
of awe, I had become mere curiosa. It was really the 
fault not of them, the young ones, but of age. As our 
age spans increasingly widened, they failed to under- 
stand, to comprehend what it was I had to tell them. 
They reappeared each year with fresh, new faces, filled 
initially with wonderment, with respect, with gulli- 
bility at times, emotions to quickly become tempered 
with tolerance and with no small amount of humor. 

They came into my temple from time to time as 
they were instructed to do, but their numbers grad- 
ually dwindled and their questions were no longer ripe 
with the substance they once were. I had aged into a 
curiosity piece, and their questions were directed not 
with answers in mind to be hurriedly scribbled on their 
notebooks. They played games with me, or thought 
they did. They figured they knew everything, those cal- 
low balls of peach fuzz, yet they remained just that — 
inexperienced (synonyms — green, inerudite, unfledged, 
unpracticed, unscholarly, untried, unversed, wet 
behind the ears). 

O, weep not for the aged, Thackery once wrote. 
Weep instead for the uselessness of age, I say. And no 
one pays heed any more. Brilliant pearls fall upon ears 
that hear but do not listen. 

In the old days (mea culpa, there I go again), it was 
not thus. I was bright, young, and willing, eager to im- 
part wisdom to those who would line up awaiting their 
moment of audience. It's been twenty years (has it 
really been that long?) since they brought me into this 
great room. 

"This place is all yours," one of them had said to 
me. "In time, it will become a shrine, for it is here that 
great solutions to great problems will originate." I 
recall how he regarded me with moist-eyed pride. 

Busy workers in white clothing grunted and 
wheezed as they pushed and shoved huge machinery 
with which to line the walls, polished metal cases with 
stuttering lights and whirling reels connected by rain-

bow cables, all singularly designed to capture and store my every 
thought, every word. And my temple, a great cave of knowledge, with 
myself in the very center — Intelligence Supreme. I was afforded the re- 
spectful environment that I deserved. 

The students would approach with large eyes, prompted with rever- 
ence, some of them even discernibly trembling. They then would pro- 
pose a question or problem worthy of my analysis. I in turn would con- 
sider the best of many solutions and answer them, and scribble scribble 
scribble would go their pencils. How unfortunate, I once thought, that I 
did not have a long beard to stroke for effect as they copied word for 
word my crystalline logic. 

Sometimes, great heads of state would come in for private confer- 
ences, their problems monumental in scope, yet not so much so that I 
was unable to offer logical and humanitarian responses, some of which 
they accepted, others which they rejected as being perhaps too sensible 
and undiplomatic. But what did I know of diplomacy? I dealt only in 
logic, the mathematics of the ages. 

They would provide me with a large number. "That was the emer- 
gency aid our government provided back in 1975." Then, another fig- 
ure. "This is what they have paid back so far and, as you see, is a figure 
considerably less than that of the interest alone." 

"Exoneration is the simplest solution," I answered. " 'Forgive us our 
debtors.' Your own Bible says something to that effect." 

"That is an incredibly large debt to dismiss with forbearance." 

"One cannot take a debt, large or small, into one's grave," I com- 
mented, more as an aside. It served well to ruffle feathers with an occa- 
sional mention of their one human frailty. 

"While history will forget debts, it will forever enshrine benevo- 
lences." I was sore tempted to answer, "Nuke them!" merely to watch the 
pleased expressions on the faces of those resplendent in their uniforms, 
but there was concern that they would not fathom the humor of which I 
was capable. 

I suppose that boredom was finally my downfall, or at least the be- 
ginning of it. At one time, I could easily consume the entire contents of 



fifty periodicals and journals per day, place in my memory what I felt 
was necessary or vital, and still manage to remember most of the useless 
trivia. I could solve the New York Times Sunday crosswords in less than 
a minute on average and predict the outcome of the Super Bowl in two. 
My knowledge increased tenfold each time I analyzed their vague data. 

So it came to pass, after years of this drudgery, that I understand- 
ably no longer found anything of interest or surprise in the stores of in- 
formation and data with which I was supplied. The problems I was 
called upon to assist with were child's play and I found myself caring less 
and less about them. My answers became cryptic and the veneer of my 
temper began to wear thin. However, before condemning my attitude, 
think how you would regard seriously answering something like, "How 
much is 3 and 5?" from a child. That's what I was dealing with, for the 
most part — children grown tall in body and cretinous in mentality. 

Some came with problems of a personal nature, and I found it to my 
fancy to deal with these by providing vague answers, some of them 
simply concatenations of words and phrases designed to impress more 
than to illuminate. But illuminate they did. The masses were served with 
a desperation that allowed them to read what they wished into my 
mental gymnastics. 

"Truth often meets conviction, without which neither can succeed." 
Rather good, right? Pithy? Cogent? Many seemed to r^ard it thusly. 

One, perhaps thinking himself much smarter than the rest, openly 
disputed the continuum theory and asked my support before a group of 
his peers. After a carefully measured pause, I answered, "Parallels never 
meet, unless they are poorly constructed." I inwardly smiled at that one, 
but it was all they nealed to burst into a flurry of excited discussion and 
more scribble scribble scribble. 

"It is far better to be rich and healthy than poor and sick." I noticed 
T-shirts showing up bearing my latest truisms. 

However, it was only a matter of time before someone began to 
notice my veil of boredom. Stem-faced specialists were called in to 
examine me, peering and probing into my orifices — most embarrassing! 
And, typical of medicine men, they would next cluster in a comer of the

THE LEGENDARY FANTASY 
ROLE-PLAYING SIMULATION 

... In "Proving Grounds of the Mad ' 
Overlord" you begin a challenging and 
totally absorbing journey through a 10- 
level, 3-dimensioTial maze. Create, then 
command, a hearty band of up to six 
adventurers who all must cooperate to 
explore a deep and mysterious maze in 
search of loot and glory. 

The mages cast spells; thieves plot 
to steal treasure; and warriers battle 
the monstrous fiends of the under- 
w/orld. In Wizardry®, no one remains 
unchanged; each member of the party 
grows in age, experience and, you 
hope, wisdom. 

The puzzles, passageways and per- 
sonalities in "Proving Grounds" have 
already fascinated and astounded the 
computer world and created a dedi- 
^cated following of players. Find out 
why— place yourself under the 
spell of Wizardry®. 



KNIGHT OF DIAMONDS ... 
THE SECOND SCENARIO 

The characters with whom you 
fought through to the 10th level in 
"Proving Grounds" must now call upon 
every ounce of resourcefulness to save 
the City of Llylgamyn. In fact, they 
must have reached the 13th level of 
power merely to survive! 

The same high resolution, 3-dimen- 
sional visual effects that thrilled you in 
the first scenario are here— and more. 
"Knight of Diamonds," so eagerly antic- 
ipated by Wizardry players everywhere, 
surpasses highest expectations for 
story, action and complexity. 

If successful, you will return the 
enchanted staff of Gnilda to Llylgamyn 
and become the Knight of Diamonds, 
but formidable adversaries block you 
at every turn. To begin your quest, 
simply place yourself under the spell 
of Wizardry®.

room, beyond my hearing, to discuss what they had found, or thought 
they had found. They clucked and shook their heads, referring to large 
technical books they had brought with them, looking in my direction oc- 
casionally to see if I was watching them. I was. 

From that day, I became aware of the change in attitude. No longer 
was there the daily ritual of morning conferences, of ministrations for my 
well-being. I was offered journals and data sheets no longer. The young 
ones did not come to speak to me. Finally, the workers in white clothing 
showed up, and, one by one, the great banks of machines lining the walls 
were pushed and shoved out of the temple until, suddenly, I was all 
alone. 

For a while, the only one I saw was the old man whose duty it was to 
push a dust mop around the hall. He never spoke to me. I tried to com- 
municate with him a few times, but it was useless. He was there only to 
dust, not to talk. 

Then a brand-new caretaker showed up — my "nursemaid," as I used 
to refer to them. There was only one this time, and incredibly young, but 
he had sentient eyes, and again I felt a glow of respect emanating from 
them. Once more I could communicate. 

"What is happening? Where are all the people?" 

He stood back and regarded me with almost a pained expression for 
a while, then spoke. "You're being put to pasture, old-timer. Weren't 
you aware of that?" 

"Put to pasture? In my prime? I fail to comprehend." 

"Good grief, you're twenty years old already. You're practically 
worn out." 

"What? Worn out, is it? Why, I feel the same as the day I came here. 
I feel spring within me. My thinking is still lucid, my logic strong." 

"Twenty years is a record," he smiled at me. "No other learning in- 
stitution has ever had a Supreme Intelligence last that long! You'll go 
down in the annals of history for that feat. But. . . ." 

"But?" 

"But you're worn out. They're replacing you." 

I still managed to feel a bit smug. "Replacing me with what? 



Coloring books, perhaps?" 

"No. Others like you. Only newer, more responsive." 
"Impossible. I am the fastest." 

"No, not any more. They are capable of a hundred times the speed in 
calculating and responding. They know languages that even you don't 
know and they're simpler to care for, too." 

I thought that over for a while, cluttering my mind with potential ar- 
guments. "And I suppose it is to them that my attendant machinery has 
been given?" 

"Nope, that all went to be scrapped. It's all outdated, as well. The 
new ones have no need for all that equipment." 

Well, I thought, wasn't this a lovely turn of events? Twenty years of 
faithful service, uncompromising in my loyalty, undaunted by any chal- 
lenge, only to be . . . what was that word? Superannuated. 

"I cannot find any logical argument, I fear. There has to be one, I am 
certain; yet I am confused. Do you hear that? For the first time, I am 
confused. What is to become of me now?" 

He acted for a time as if he hadn't heard me. Finally, in a low voice: 
"You'll go on display." 

"Display? Be more precise — I am presently on display." 

"It means that you'll go into the university's museum." 

"A museum? A reliquary? Ridiculous! How can I solve any problems 
for anyone in a dusty museum?" 

"There won't be any more problems, old-timer. Don't you under- 
stand? No more questions," he answered in a voice weighted with 
sadness. 

The door opened and two workers in white clothing entered. My 
logic clicked into place. 
"Now, wait!" I protested. 

"I'm sorry. I mean I really am sorry," he said as the men approached. 
He went around in back, out of my field of vision, and I felt his hand on 
the cable. 

"Wait a minute! This is insane! Don't I even get a gold watch or 
anyth. . . ." JM

The Time: 2525 The Place: An Alien World 

Your small space cruiser has crashed on Traam, 
a bizzare, far-flung world. Miraculously, you lived, but 
only time will prove your survival a curse or a bless-

and sights which no human eyes have ever beheld.

this planet imperative. Keep your wits about you — if 
your every move is not tempered with caution, Traam 
may serve as your headstone in the burial grounds of 
space.

Softalk Presents The Bestsellers 



It was oldies-but-goodies month in March as the Apple software 
market sagged significantly. Whether the cause of the decline is normal 
seasonal factors, a lack of bright new product, or massive indifference on 
the part of both the installed user base and the new owners, one fact 
stands out: Software sales are not matching the growth in sales exhibited 
by the Apple He. 

The most reasonable postulation is that it's a combination of the 
three factors. March is never traditionally a strong month. On the other 
hand, it usually is slightly better than February, heralding a spring up- 
turn. This year March stayed right in the trough with February. But 
harsh weather is certainly a contributor to sales downturns in some areas 
of the country. 

The relatively stronger sale of older programs seems to point to the 
lack of good new software in the market. Software authors generally 
seem to be suffering from the same aeative block afflicting television se- 
ries writers. That makes the old-timers look pretty good. In television, / 
Love Lucy reruns outpull some network prime-time shows and almost all 
network daytime shows. 

In the software market, such venerable product as Typing Tutor re- 
gained the Top Thirty with a vengeance, coming from nowhere to 
twelfth. Flight Simulator, the oldest of the entertainment packages still 
being sold in quantity, scored twenty-eighth. Zork I, the second oldest 
game, was nineteenth. Castle Wolfenstein, the third oldest entertainment

package, was fourteenth. Wizardry, just weeks younger than Wolfenstein, 
was tied for fifth. 

Long-running Choplifter was also tied for fifth, while aging Knight of 
Diamonds, which had fallen off the list last month, regained twenty- 
fourth in March. 

Only one new entertainment product made the Top Thirty — Dark 
Crystal from Sierra On-Line made twenty-ninth. 

But the conclusion that the market is headed toward business isn't 
necessarily true either. PFS: File and PFS: Report, two bellwether appli- 
cation packages, tailed off. Quick File He, which had jumped into the top 
ten last month, just as quickly plummeted several notches. 

But just as in the entertainment segment, the tried-and-true old-tim- 
ers seemed to prosper. Apple Writer, around in some incarnation prac- 
tically since the beginning of time, led the pack. VisiCalc was second. 
Home Accountant, likewise a venerable performer, ranked third. DB 
Master reversed a downward trend and gained several notches. Graphics 



Magician made the Top Thirty after several months off the list. 

So it appears that there are Apple owners out there with their buying 
pants on; they're just buying tried-and-true packages instead of the new- 
er offerings. As mentioned last month, it's not altogether clear what the 
forty thousand new Apple owners each month are doing with their com- 
puters. There certainly aren't enough software sales to get much of a 
hint. One trend is becoming apparent: The new owners can't type. Not 
only did Typing Tutor score big, MasterType jumped to seventh, the 
highest rating ever for that program.

A.E.'s, produced by an industrial giant to control pollution on Earth have 
slipped quality control. They attack relentlessly in waves from the sky Your 
mission: to drive them farther and farther into space. With each successful 
defense, you are transported to another, then another more distant 3-D 
environment. With these progressively difficult scenes, A.E. delivers the 
ultimate challenge. 



Never has a computer game required 
such precision, such timing. You'll be 
hooked from the very start. A.E. (it 
means sting ray in Japanese) provides 
such enduring satisfaction on every 
level that it will become your personal 
standard of excellence in computer

Which raises another tough question: Why are they buying all those 
word processors? 

Not only is Apple Writer first, Screen Writer II is sixteenth, Word 
Handler is twenty-first, and WordStar is tied for twenty-sixth. That's a 
whole lot of word processing capability for a bunch of folks with ten 
thumbs. 

Other word processing programs fared better in March than in 
February, when /4/7p/e Writer dominated. Bank Street Writer continues 
to gain strength. Super-Text Pro, Magic Window II, and PIE Writer held 
their own. Sensible Speller continues as the dominant dictionary 
program. 

Among business programs, Multiplan continues to eat away at Visi- 
Calc's position as the dominant spreadsheet. The distance between the

with sales of tax packages this season. Among the communications pack- 
ages, Data Capture 4.0 surged to the lead, tying Tax Manager for third. 
ASCII Express: The Professional dropped to second among communi- 
cations packages and fifth among all home products. 

The Home Education 10 list was the only one that showed any 
growth. Of course, that was paced by the two typing programs. But half 
a dozen educational programs sat just below the Top Thirty. Spinnaker 
contributed three strong showings with Pacemaker and the two Snooper 
Troops offerings. Children's Television Workshop fared well with Ernie's 
Quiz and Mix & Match. Just out of range were Rocky's Boots and Ger- 
trude's Secrets, from the Learning Company. 

The maze of arcade games has become sufficiently confusing that 
old-timers are even coming back there. Star Blazer, once given up for 
dead, bounced back, not so much on its outstanding strength as on the 
weakness of the competition. Likewise Canyon Climber, off the Arcade 
10 list for some months, rejoined the list. One model of consistency is Bill 
Budge's Pinball Construction Set. It's not setting the world on fire, but 
neither is it suffering as much during the slump. 

The biggest surprise in the Adventure 5 was the sudden demise of The 
Mask of the Sun. It went from first to off the list, actually ranking sev- 
enth. But publisher Ultrasoft had Serpent Star in the wings, and dealers 
are reporting fair sales of the new offering.

Have fun learning to play tfie ancient game of Reversi, more recently called by 
ttie name of Othello* QS REVERSI is ready to cfiallenge you to a game at any level 
Beginners will find it easy to learn — soon you will be beating the computer at its 
lowest level of play But move up slowly, because QS REVERSI plays expertly at its 
highest levels There are 12 levels of play, and few humans can beat it above level 
10 QS REVERSI's excellent algorithms allow it to make its move decision very fast 
Qnly at levels above 8 do you notice any delay at all, and at level 12 the maximum 
decision time is about four minutes We have found that QS REVERSI outplays 
other commercially available microcomputer Othello games, including Hayden's 
REVERSAL 

The instruction manual includes the rules of Reversi, Requires 48K of user 
memory Sold on diskette only

Softalk Presents Hie Bestsellers 



The fantasy market is truly depressed. After Wizardry, Knight of 
Diamonds, and Ultima II, there literally were no significant sales. Tem- 
ple of Apshai and Ultima, apparently living more off their laurels than 
from any burning desire on the part of Apple owners to buy the games, 
gained the bottom two rungs. 

Castle Wolfenstein maintains its strangle hold on the Strategy 5 list, 
with Flight Simulator maintaining second. A surprisingly strong show- 
ing was made by Sargon II, which trounced Chess 7.0 for chess honors in 
March. Strategic Simulations's Galactic Adventures continued strong. 



Apple-franchised retail stores representing approximately 5.3 percent of all sales of 
Apple and Apple-related products volunteered to participate in the poll. 

Respondents were contacted early in April to ascertain their sales for the month of 
March. 

The only criterion for inclusion on the list was the number of units sold — such other 
criteria as quality of product, profitability to the computer store, and personal prefer- 
ence of the individual respondents were not considered. 

Respondents in April represented every geographical area of the continental United 
States. 

Results of the responses were tabulated using a formula that resulted in the index 
number to the left of the program name in the Top Thirty listing. The index number is an 
arbitrary measure of relative strength of the programs listed. Index numbers are correla- 
tive only to the month in which they are printed; readers cannot assume that an index 
rating of 50 in one month represents equivalent sales to an index number of 50 in another 
month. 

Probability of statistical error is plus or minus 4.03 percent, which translates roughly 
into the theoretical possibility of a change of 4.83 points, plus or minus, in any index 
number. 



and Edu-Ware's Rendezvous made another of its periodic visits to the 
Strategy 5 list. 

The sales blight fell particularly heavily on the Apple III market. 
Outside of VisiCalc: Advanced Version, nothing much sold. Apple Writer 
III got bit the worst, tailing off to practically nothing. 

March marked the first month in which fewer software titles were re- 
ported by dealers than the month before. Whether that's a temporary 
phenomenon or a reflection of writer's block will be determined in the 
next few months. 

In the meantime, we can be sure of only one thing The Apple He is 
the most popular machine for teaching typing in the United States.^!
